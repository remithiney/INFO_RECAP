Fallout's Latest Episode Snuck In An Incredible Fallout: New Vegas Meme,"Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead. Another week, another episode of Fallout. This week saw lots of use of Lucy’s (Ella Purnell) “Golden Rule” and a look into the politics of the Brotherhood of Steel. In many ways this episode felt like a significant step forward for the series, but it also took its time to honor Fallout’s past. From iconic locations to lore deep cuts , there was no shortage of callbacks. Let's take a look at what “The Golden Rule” had to offer.

"Fallout Season 2, Episode 2 Summary: War (And Radscoprions) Never Change","Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead. While last week focused on Lucy (Ella Purnell), Cooper Howard aka The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and their pursuit of Hank (Kyle Maclachlan), this week we caught up with the newly knighted Maximus (Aaron Moten) and his chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline. The episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast.

AI VTuber Neuro-Sama Just Obliterated Her Own Massive Twitch World Record,"In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the Vedal987 Twitch channel within a limited time. Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a Minecraft Hardcore run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can ""see"" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model. Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.

"I Hated Parrying, Until I Played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33","Parrying is about subtlety. It's the act of scrutinizing fisticuffs and sword fights with a furrowed brow, familiarizing yourself with the cadence of combat right down to milliseconds, and learning the precise moment of performing a counter attack. For instance, a small variation in animation may point to a rare opening. A slight note change in the audio cue may indicate a shift of attacks from the enemy. To parry well is to understand these details and adapt to them dexterously. That said, doing so is exhausting. The requirements needed to pull off a parry in most games can be steep and exacting. It's why I'd usually avoid parrying if there are other ways to minimize damage during combat, such as blocking or dodging. The painterly Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, one of my favorite RPGs this year, has been the exception. Within its dazzling combat system I've discovered the joy of parrying, every encounter an exhilarating sequence of silky-smooth attacks and ripostes. Fighting in Expedition 33 is a resplendent affair, thanks to its surprisingly in-depth and complex structure. Its skirmishes enhance JRPG-inspired turn-based combat with real-time elements that get players to dodge--and parry--at the right moment.

"New Zenless Zone Zero Figures Are Miyabi, Harumasa, Ellen Joe","Myethos announced three Zenless Zone Zero figures of Asaba Harumasa, Hoshimi Miyabi, and Ellen Joe that are in various stages of development. The Sparkling Wonderland Gift+ version of Harumasa is furthest along, while the Ellen Joe one is only confirmed as a teaser silhouette . There are no release windows for any of them. We should see them worldwide like past figures based on characters from the game . As Harumasa is furthest along in development, we have the best idea of how he’ll look. He’s wearing a casual outfit with an oversized blue sweater over white and black shirts and black pants. He has a guitar at his side, with his right arm leaning on it. It will be 1/8 scale and already showed up as a painted prototype, so it’s possible we’ll see it release in 2026. The Miyabi and Ellen Joe designs are earlier in the process. Miyabi did show up as an unpainted prototype . That design featured her in a formal-style dress while playing a keytar. The Ellen Joe silhouette only hints at her possible pose, which suggests she’ll be holding a guitar and waving. Here are all the Myethos teaser photos for the Gift+ Zenless Zone Zero Asaba Harumasa, Hoshimi Miyabi, and Ellen Joe figures. Images via Myethos and HoYoVerse Myethos is well known for its HoYoVerse series figures. One that we’ll see in 2026 is a Honkai: Star Rail concert figure of Castorice playing a harp. The Zenless Zone Zero Asaba Harumasa, Hoshimi Miyabi, and Ellen Joe Myethos Gift+ figures are in development. The game is available on the PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and mobile devices.

Tsunayoshi Sawada From Reborn Suits Up in New Nendoroid,"Good Smile Company announced a new Katekyo Hitman Reborn Nendoroid of Tsunayoshi Sawada, and its based on his appearance later in the series when he’s wearing his black suit and acknowledged as Vongola Family head, Vongola X. It costs ￥7,200 / $44.99 . We’ll see it in Japan in July 2026, followed by a worldwide release in Q4 2026. It follows the release of a standard and more casual version of Sawada in his school uniform. Since Sawada is all business for this figure, the face plates reflect that. There’s one where he looks stoic and serious, one that’s similar to that with glowing eyes, and an X-BURNER shouting face. He has a Vongola chair to show his position as heir, with parts that can pose him sitting in it. He also has X-Headphones and Dying Will Flame parts. His Vongola Box Weapon is attached to his suit and Leone di Cieli ver Vongola (Nuts) comes with him as an accessory. Here are all the example photos of the Tsunayoshi Sawada Black Suit Reborn Nendoroid: Images via Good Smile Company There’s also a Good Smile Company storefront exclusive. If someone buys the Nendoroid direct from them, you also get two additional hand parts. One involves Sawada holding two Dying Will Pills in his left hand, while the right hand is holding a case for them. Image via Good Smile Company One of the last updates on Reborn merchandise involved a crossover with Sanrio mascots . The Black Suit Katekyo Hitman Reborn Nendoroid of Tsunayoshi Sawada will come to Japan in July 2026 and the US in Q4 2026. Pre-orders are open until February 4, 2026. The Reborn anime is streaming on Crunchyroll , and Viz Media handles the manga.

Siliconera’s PC Game of the Year 2025,"The PC has been a welcoming home in recent years to the best indie releases, letting them catch on and work out bugs before heading to other platforms. Siliconera’s PC Game of the Year selections carry on this spirit, with games that did make it to other systems but were made possible through the PC ecosystem. These awards represent the consensus of the Siliconera staff. Multiplatform games are considered on the platform for which they received the most staff support. For more of the year’s award selections, check out our Game of the Year 2025 archive . Hades II Building on the ideas of the first game (and developer Supergiant’s long line of work building indie darlings), Hades II is a game in which it’s hard to find fault. The team’s hard work to polish and iterate in Early Access shows through , and the resulting lack of friction makes it a joy to go through its gameplay loop over and over again. Monster Train 2 Following up on the excellent first Monster Train , this sequel pulls a Gold & Silver and effectively doubles the possibilities for strategy. Or maybe more than that? Since it relies on a mash-up approach, doubling the factions means an exponential increase in the number of combinations. And each pair has its own strategies! Its effective daily challenges make it a handy companion for the long term, so we’ll be playing it for quite a while to come. Winner: Blue Prince Exploration puzzle games like Myst certainly have their fans, but others bounce off the genre because the solutions seem a bit obtuse. Blue Prince grounds its delightful puzzles in established systems with clues and clear throughlines, making for a solve that feels thoroughly rewarding but never overly frustrating. Add to that the wit and commitment to aesthetic and you have a game that shouldn’t be missed . (Just bring along a journal for notes!)

Free Fantasy Life i Roguelike DLC Debuts,"Last week, Level-5 promised it would have the Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time free, roguelike DLC called The Sinister Broker Bazario’s Schemes would be out “ around Christmas .” On December 24, 2025, the developer and publisher released the add-on worldwide.

I Hope Cross Blitz Gets More Quality of Life Adjustments,"We’ve been able to watch Cross Blitz grow over the last few years. After all, the roguelike deck-building game started out in early access back in November 2023, with Tako Boy Studios gradually building it up until its November 2025 launch two years later. We’ve seen the team adjust and fix issues. While I do appreciate how far the team and game has come, it feels like it’s lacking some important quality of life adjustments. Cross Blitz is unusual in that it does feature some roguelike elements, but it’s also a deck-building game with strategic elements that features a more traditional campaign too. The two parts feed into each other, in a way. The Fables Story Mode follows the characters Mereena, Quill, Redcroft, Seto, and Violet as they go around the world fighting in matches with their decks to accomplish individual goals after winning matches. This can feel a bit like the Game Boy Pokemon Trading Card Game affairs, in terms of the whole collectible card RPG thing, and each storyline is three chapters long. Doing well here unlocks cards via actions like completing recipes or earning XP as you go through chapters, which feed into your deck in further affairs. In the Tusk Tales roguelike mode, you and one of 20 mercenaries go through randomized matches to earn Husks and build your deck up, with both your partner’s cards and your own influencing what the build can look like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twc6R34RMc Matches proceed a lot like Hearthstone . You’ll find certain synergies and archetypes to build around when collecting and compiling cards. These are placed in the 4x4 field, with four spaces in front of each of the two players. (There’s no competitive multiplayer against actual people, with only virtual opponents available.) Relics can be acquired to help affect matches and runs as well. There are hundreds of cards, so there’s so much freedom when developing decks. And the Tusk Tales Mode has daily and weekly hunts to encourage revisiting even if the Fables are all done. The actual core gameplay is fine. So the first issue with Cross Blitz is that there’s no native controller support. It is planned. Tako Boy Studios confirmed it on the Steam Discussions board . But considering this is a game that’s been in early access for two years now, the fact that it’s a genre that we’ve seen comfortably accommodate controller support before, and that we’re about a month out of 1.0 without it, it’s disappointing that it’s absent. It’s one of the things that keeps me from really enjoying and getting into it on a Lenovo Legion Go or Steam Deck-like handheld gaming PC. Image via Tako Boy Studios The other is the UI. In a deck-building game or roguelike with those elements, being able to clearly understand what you’re doing and see what cards can do is critical, and Cross Blitz is not great at it. Especially if you are playing it on a handheld gaming PC. The menus aren’t helpful. Informative boxes will overlap and block out information. The cards themselves tend to be very clear, with descriptions that let us know what they do, though the brevity does mean sometimes critical information might not appear. This means you’ll need to learn by doing. Combine that with times when it can feel like it’s harder to put together some decks, collect some cards, and check some information than it could be due to some QOL UI issues, and it’s a bit buggy. I’m still experiencing some crashes and lag. Cross Blitz ’s actual matches and modes are quite fun, with so many deck-building options, but it feels like it needs a few more patches. It’s close to being a really great game! It’s just not quite perfect yet. In a way, that’s a little disappointing. You’d expect some of these crash, UI, and QOL elements to be addressed after two years in early access. But one controller support is in the pipeline and we already saw a patch on December 2, 2025 , so I’m hopeful it will be in a much better position in a few more weeks. Cross Blitz is available on PCs.

Square Enix Shares Final Fantasy Series Survey,"Square Enix announced it is looking for feedback on the Final Fantasy series via a new survey, with the official questionnaire that asks questions about the games available online until January 9, 2026. It is for people ages 16 and up and features over 30 questions about the JRPGs, as well as merchandise and promotions tied to them. There is no reward, like a wallpaper, for participating. Things start out simple enough with some demographic questions. For example, it starts by asking which consoles and platforms someone has access to, how we find out about games, and our age. There are also questions in the survey designed to gauge how familiar someone is with the Final Fantasy series and how many games they know and bought, like ones asking how many titles were purchased in the last year and if someone picked up FFT: The Ivalice Chronicles . There are general awareness questions to find out if people know about old and new releases, such as the Magic the Gathering expansion and Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy. Some of the questions also get into what we might like to see shared on official Final Fantasy accounts for games. For example, Square Enix asked for the reader to select which of nine calendar designs shared on social media they liked best. Square Enix also tries to gauge interest in celebrating entries’ anniversaries in this poll. It asks how interested they are in honoring specific titles and the series as a whole. The final question also allows you to write in general feedback or specific requests. The Final Fantasy Questionnaire is live now, with people able to fill out the survey and share thoughts until January 9, 2026.

2.7 Persona 5: The Phantom X Shared Cut-in TikTok Filter,"As part of the 2.7 Persona 5: The Phantom X stream , Atlus announced an official cut-in TikTok filter based on the cut-in effect from more recent entries in the series. It will appear worldwide in “late December” 2025. First footage highlighting how it will work also appeared during the reveal segment. [Thanks, Razmos on Resetera !] For the segment, we got to see how Neki Matsuzawa would look when using the Persona 5: The Phantom X cut-in TikTok filter. When selected, the splash effect will show on-screen and make the background behind the person’s face look completely red. The person being photographed can then arrange their face to be within the gap in order to create their perfect cut-in, like one seen during an All-Out Attack. This version is specifically based on the mobile game’s effect. You can see the introduction to the filter at the 1:11:35 moment in the stream below. https://youtu.be/U80zfUhWYLU?t=4296 As for the rest of the stream, it primarily focused on the half-anniversary event and introduction of Caroline and Justine.

New SuperGroupies Kingdom Hearts Items Based on Sora and Roxas,"SuperGroupies announced new items in its Kingdom Hearts collection, as it is now selling new jackets, purses, and Keyblade bag charms based on Sora and Roxas. These are only showing on the Japanese storefront at the moment, as the section based on the series on the US website didn’t update yet. Global shipping is available via WorldShopping, and items are expected to ship out in early June 2026. Both the Sora and Roxas Kingdom Hearts jackets are ¥33,000 (~$211) each. Both are available in sizes small through XXL. While there are patches inside with their Keyblades referenced, the designs on the back are the most notable parts. Sora’s black jacket features the Kingdom Key, images referencing his time on Destiny Islands, and the message, “My friends are my power.” Roxas’ white one has black accents, an interior patch with Oathkeeper and Oblivion Keyblades, and a back design with both of those keychains, a reference to Organization XIII, and the message, “Looks like my summer vacation is… over.” The Kingdom Hearts purses also feature similar matching designs that go together while referencing the two characters. Sora’s bag is primarily black, with a stained glass interior referencing the Paupu fruit and Destiny Islands.

"Tales of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5 Game Cases Become Keychains","Bandai Namco announced new Tales of series anniversary items that turn the cover and cases of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5 games into keychains. These will first be sold for 300円 (~$2) per try on Gashapon Online in Japan between December 24, 2025 and January 25, 2026, with items shipping in late May 2026. They will also appear in physical machines in the country and may do so before the online orders ship. Since Bandai Namco does operate Gashapon capsule machines worldwide, we could also see these everywhere in 2026. There are eight game cases referenced in this Tales of series keychain collection, with two PS1 entries, two PS2 JRPGs, two PS3 covers, one PS4 one, and one PS5 one appearing. Each features an exact replica of the front cover art and back design, and opening the case up reveals a tiny disc. There are also no “secrets,” so there is an equal chance of pulling each design. Here are the eight titles represented: Tales of Phantasia Tales of Destiny Tales of Symphonia Tales of the Abyss Tales of Vesperia Tales of Xillia Tales of Berseria Tales of Arise And here’s how they’ll all look: Images via Bandai Namco This isn’t the first time Bandai Namco released keychain charms based on game cases.

Yakuza 3 Kiwami and Dark Ties Direct Highlights New Gameplay Additions,"Ahead of the holidays, Sega and RGG used a Direct showcase to offer another look at Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties, the updated version of the third installment , which focuses on the new gameplay elements in both Kazuma Kiryu and Yoshitaka Mine’s storylines. This also offers another opportunity to see how existing Life at Morning Glory Orphanage elements with Kiryu look in this version of the game. The Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties Direct started with the base game. Things began by showing Kiryu and his adopted daughter Haruka at the Morning Glory Orphanage in Okinawa. This section showed off minigames and Family Time Event scenes with the kids living at Morning Glory. We see Kiryu cook, farm, assist with science homework, sew, fish, and play with kids. The Family Time scenes are a bit like substories, in that he’ll get to know each kid and connect with them during side quests. From there, we get to see the new Bad Boy Dragon element of Yakuza Kiwami 3, with the video showing gameplay of Kiryu assisting the Haisai Girls as they protect Okinawa from other groups like Tokyo Nightmare. This means increasing the ranks of the gang, getting them equipment, and taking squadrons into fights. At the 2:50 mark, the presentation focused on some of the new Yoshitaka Mine storyline features. This is all new-to-us and added for this release. While part of this segment focused on showing how his storyline will work, a big features for this section of the Direct ended up being Kanda Damage Control and Hell’s Arena. In the former, Mine takes on Good Deeds, Helping the Little People, and Damage Control Challenges to increase your Kanda Rep rank in town to get monetary rewards and see Bro Time scenes. Hell’s Arena involves opportunities to fight for rewards and glory. In a Hellish Brawl, Mine faces a single opponent. If you select a Survival Hell run, that sends him into an area filled with enemies for greater rewards. Here’s the full Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties Direct showcase highlighting new gameplay footage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOaNzqWpzCs Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties will come to the Switch 2, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on February 12, 2026. The original game is on the PS3, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

Siliconera’s PlayStation Game of the Year 2025,"Welcome to Siliconera’s Game of the Year awards! All week, we’ll be naming our top games, culminating in our overall selection. We’re starting off with our PlayStation category, which might have been the most cutthroat competition of the bunch. Read on for our selections! These awards represent the consensus of the Siliconera staff. Multiplatform games are considered on the platform for which they received the most staff support. For more of the year’s award selections, check out our Game of the Year 2025 archive . Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Even though it’s a side game of sorts, Pirate Yakuza has a lot going for it . Ship battles! Fun combat! Weird substories and side activities! It may not be a load-bearing part of the franchise’s structure, but it uses that freedom to be delightfully wacky. If only they'd put in a few more Master System games ... Digimon Story: Time Stranger The Digimon Story games have breathed new life into a franchise that has seen its affinity outstrip its appeal, and Time Stranger continues that work of making a tentpole release worthy of the fandom. The traditional JRPG structure gives more players an entry point, but don’t get it twisted: there’s a truly wild level of depth and customization to explore. And yet, in this case, they're not quite the champions. Winner: Hollow Knight: Silksong Worth the wait? Few games with development times as long as Hollow Knight: Silksong manage to live up to the years of anticipation , but Team Cherry’s sequel sure delivered . Hornet’s quest features mechanical refinements and a lush world that keeps you exploring more. Congratulations to our PlayStation Game of the Year 2025!

Zenless Zone Zero Version 2.5 introduces dual-form Void Hunter on December 30,"Hello, Proxies! Greetings from the Zenless Zone Zero dev team. I’m Zhenyu Li, the producer of Zenless Zone Zero. As our exploration of Waifei Peninsula deepens, the culminating chapter of Season 2 finally sheds light on long-buried secrets. I am excited to share that Zenless Zone Zero Version 2.5 “To Be Fuel for the Night” will arrive on December 30, bringing abundant content, optimizations, and rewards. Unraveling the secrets hidden within the Hollow’s expansion During past battles, the legendary Qingming Sword resonated strangely deep within the Lemnian Hollow, implying its primordial power has a profound connection to the Hollow. After borrowing this strength to overcome formidable foes, Ye Shunguang now faces the inevitable cost of wielding such extraordinary power. Meanwhile, mysterious white flowers — previously seen only within the Hollows — have begun blooming in Failume Heights, casting a foreboding shadow over the district. Amid the rising tension, Zhao of the Krampus Compliance Authority arrives with alarming news: the Lemnian Hollow has expanded. Proxies will join Ye Shunguang and Zhao to venture into the ruins of the Lumite Mine to investigate anomalies, delve deeper into the conspiracy of the Exaltists, and face the ultimate battle in Waifei Peninsula. Rise of Void Hunter Ye Shunguang After forging countless cherished memories with Ye Shunguang and fighting alongside her to awaken Ye Shiyuan, Proxies will once again join forces with this young senior disciple of Yunkui Summit. As the game’s first dual-form Void Hunter, Ye Shunguang, an S-Rank Honed Edge Attack Agent, can unleash fluid strikes and explosive burst phases with the Qingming Sword, delivering intimidating attacks that can make a significant impact in intense battles. A familiar Agent accompanying us on this adventure is Zhao. Despite her adorable appearance, Zhao holds the legacy of the unbeaten legend of Krampus Compliance Authority. As an S-Rank Ice Defense Agent, Zhao will bring immense power to the battlefield and provide crucial support to Ye Shunguang. Enhanced experience with a multitude of events and optimizations With rich events and ongoing optimizations, Version 2.5 brings enhanced game experiences and a more vibrant Proxy Outpost community feature. The long-awaited multiplayer combat is coming in the form of the limited-time event Joint Investigation: The Divine Maze. Players can form three-member squads to tackle cooperative challenges, putting their teamwork and coordination to the test in dynamic combat encounters. In addition to upgrades to Shiyu Defense and Deadly Assault, a new addition, the Proxy Outpost, will help to foster community interaction. Through the in-game forum, Proxies can create or join interest-based outposts to share passions, post commissions, and accept tasks. At the same time, a new quick-sweep function will be introduced to Combat Simulation, allowing players to use Ether Batteries to quickly obtain agent promotion materials and Drive Discs. Altogether, these free up time for relaxation and leisure in New Eridu. The enhanced experience also extends to our valuable companions in the Hollows. To allow our previous Agent friends to better adapt to the harsher battlefield, we will gradually enhance all agents in the permanent Stable Channel in the near future. In Version 2.5, agents including Soldier 0 – Anby, Ellen, Soldier 11, Grace, and Burnice will be the first to receive refinements to their combat mechanics and performance boosts, marking the second wave of enhancements for Soldier 0 – Anby and Ellen. Ring in the new year with exclusive rewards To embrace the upcoming new year, Zenless Zone Zero is gearing up to welcome both new and returning Proxies. All players can dive directly into the intriguing story of Version 2.5 through the Advance Screening function, claim a free S-Rank Agent Zhao and agent promotion materials, and obtain Jane Doe’s new outfit through the Today’s Outfit section of the Store. In addition, to celebrate Zenless Zone Zero winning the Grand Award at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025, an additional 1,000 Polychromes will be distributed as a token of appreciation for all Proxies’ support. The expansion of the Lemnian Hollow and the emergence of the mysterious white flowers signal a pivotal moment in the story of New Eridu. With powerful new allies, adrenaline-fueled co-op combat, and community-driven features, Version 2.5 invites you to embark on this thrilling adventure with us. Thank you for your unwavering support. We look forward to sharing this new chapter with you on December 30, and wish you all the best in 2026!",2025-12-19T13:00:08+00:00,Zhenyu Li,PlayStation.Blog,https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/19/zenless-zone-zero-version-2-5-introduces-dual-form-void-hunter-on-december-30/

World War Z x The Walking Dead lurches onto PS5 & PS4 In January,"Fast versus slow. This varying approach to depicting zombies in film, television, and video games has been going on for decades. The Zekes in World War Z are known for their speed and relentless aggression, stacking on top of each other in a frenzied bloodlust to seek out their next meal. But as we pondered this concept, we found ourselves asking, “Why not both?” The idea of transforming gameplay with Walkers became the crux of our partnership with AMC to bring a crossover episode of The Walking Dead into World War Z. Play Video Maps will still be similarly-sized as to what you’ve experienced in World War Z so far, but we’ve made the routes that you traverse more narrow and claustrophobic. You’ll be forced to take down tougher and deadlier herds as they slowly shuffle towards you, with a constant threat of being overwhelmed. Our special Zekes (Bulls, Bombers, etc.) will remain a part of the mixture of enemies, but we’ve also added in a new special – the Spiked Walker. He’s got an armored head and can cause players to bleed if they get too close to him. As you may have guessed, melee is a bad idea — at least initially. You should take down the Spiked Walker from range, forcing it to go prone, then finish it off with a coup de grace for the most efficient kill. If you don’t kill it while it’s down, it will get right back up and keep coming for you. But the Walkers are not the only content in this crossover DLC… This new campaign episode brings to life three separate but thrilling chapters starring legendary characters from AMC’s The Walking Dead – Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Negan, and Michonne. Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus have reprised their roles, providing the voiceover to bring these fan-favorite characters to life. The Walking Dead’s heroes won’t be coming empty-handed, either. Rick brings along a new weapon skin for his trusty Revolver, while Daryl sports a new skin for his lethal Crossbow. Michonne and Negan will each wield completely new melee weapons – Michonne with her iconic Katana and Negan with his one and only Baseball Bat, “Lucille”. As for the stories themselves, Chapter 1 begins at The Prison, where Rick, Daryl, Michonne, and Negan battle their way through the correctional facility that the band of survivors previously used as a base, then abandoned when it was overrun. What begins as a rescue mission quickly becomes a life and death struggle to survive against an army of the dead. In Chapter 2, the four return home to Alexandria, only to discover that the town is on fire and overrun with Walkers. A series of problems make it more and more difficult to ensure the safety of the survivors within. It may take some ingenuity to salvage that which remains… Finally, in Chapter 3, the crew travels to Grady Memorial Hospital to retrieve life-saving medication for their community. Atlanta, however, is more walker-infested than the last time they were there, so they have to be extremely cautious as they make their way through the hospital. If they succeed, it could mean saving many lives. We hope that this crossover of post-apocalyptic universes proves once and for all that both slow and fast zombies can indeed coexist, albeit delightfully un-peacefully.

Hades 2 is our favourite game of 2025 or: why we didn't give Supergiant's roguelike a bestest best review,"For the past month we have been shouting about the games we consider to be the best games of 2025. As is tradition, our choices for the RPS Advent Calendar haven't appeared in an order from least good to best – to us, they're all special. However, that's not true of the game behind door number 24. When the team's votes were counted, it was a close thing, with only five points in it, but there was a winner. RPS's favourite game of 2025 is Hades 2 . Now, perhaps someone would like to explain why we didn't give Supergiant's roguelite wonder a Bestest Best sticker?

It mispronounced lines in Arc Raiders , ""drew"" a smudgy loading screen in Anno 117 , voiced a sweary Darth Vader in Fortnite – perhaps its least subtle appearance was in Where Winds Meet, the wuxia-themed open-world RPG that plugged some of its minor NPCs into AI chatbots.

The story opens with the people of Lumière celebrating its annual get-together where the Paintress, a sobbing giant beyond the city’s shores, etches a number into a cliff, and hundreds of onlookers immediately evaporate into petals and smoke.

Some things are just gone, a product of their time, your fondness for them tied to some ephemeral capacity or limitation long since stretched out or hammered in by time and, in the case of games, a wealth of fresher and more convenient alternatives. But Tempest Rising is not C&C again. Even though I've summarised it as such in a few emails, given the clear similarity of its design and setting. It feels more like an original work made with modern tools by a second team with roughly the same remit, and while I don't love it, I enjoy and respect it so much more than a flat remake.

It’s a better outcome than expected, given Steam’s centrality to PC gaming, and a strong demonstration of support for art that is prepared to disregard taboos and investigate something profoundly ugly. It’s also, however, not enough to keep Santa Ragione operational.

Smarter than the Steam Frame: inside the VR mod that’s brought virtual reality to hundreds of games,"Valve’s recently announced Steam Frame is promising a unique twist on VR headsets . On top of being a Quest 3 -style standalone headset that can both stream games from a powerful PC and run less demanding games on its own internals, the latter won’t be limited to VR titles – by using SteamOS as its operating system, the Frame can locally run any Steam game in your library, provided it can perform on the hardware. That’s all fine, especially in how it bypasses classic VR issues like the need for base stations or an expensive desktop. But the smartest thing in VR right now is not the Steam Frame. It isn’t even hardware. It’s a mod. Enter Praydog's UEVR, or Universal Unreal Engine VR : a mod that’s quietly turned hundreds (potentially thousands) of Unreal Engine games into playable, room-scale VR experiences since its release.

"Hard Void is a chilling 4X strategy game inspired by Stellaris and Master of Orion, where FTL travel risks getting Cthulhu's attention","What music do you expect from a 4X game? As regards historical 4X games, I predict a mixture of triumphal philharmonics and noodly period skits, as though wandering between the main floor and the giftshop in some museum of empire. If it's a fantasy game, I think of choirs blaring wordlessly or singing doggerel Latin or Welsh. If it's a sci-fi game, I think of choirs and synth. I haven't heard any choirs so far in Hard Void, though I may have encountered some synth. As regards the trailer and demo, it deals exclusively in heart-battering techno. It sounds like 3am in a club I wouldn't have been old enough to get into, when this kind of stuff was in vogue. I can picture the bouncer glaring at me. Gosh, the bouncer sure has funny-shaped pupils. Mates, I fear the bouncer may be Lovecraftian.

For anyone keeping track of the 40K XCOM-alike, that'll sound like a delay, considering it had previously mumbled something about launching in 2025.

Now, imagine that the stalled production line is producing plasma swords for your army of murder droids. You need your army of murder droids to fight another army of murder droids, but unfortunately, all of your murder droids are now swordless, and therefore murder droids no longer.

GenAI users Larian forced to build Divinity around RAM shortage caused by GenAI,"The ongoing RAM shortage (and subsequent and pricing explosion) is imposing a wider range of grim effects than even the Great GPU Famine of 2020. First came the death of one of gaming hardware’s most reliable memory and SSD makers, and now... uh... Larian’s new Divinity game is going to be more optimised for PC than it otherwise would have been? That’s what Larian CEO Swen Vincke (clearly on a media tour – here’s him discussing Divinity with our Edwin ) told TheGamer , anyway. Vincke notes that because the lack of affordable RAM options is making it harder to predict the horsepower of future PCs, ""we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time."" That doesn’t sound especially horrible to me – higher performance on lower-end rigs ultimately means more players can join in – though nowhere in the full interview does Vincke acknowledge that the shortage is being directly caused and sustained by demand from data centres that power generative AI, a technology that Larian are using in Divinity’s production, and that Vincke himself is defending the use of .

"Creative Assembly explain Total War: Warhammer 40,000's factions - the Eldar ""play totally differently to anything we’ve ever done""","Creative Assembly have taken us a little deeper into the biomechanical contours of Total War: Warhammer 40,000 ’s faction design, with a new development roundtable video featuring principal creative director Ian Roxburgh, lead designer Simon Mann and product owner for battles David Petry. The short version: the starting faction balance is a question of both asymmetry and calculated familiarity. The Imperial Guard are for Total War traditionalists, with a straightforward emphasis on production and attrition. The Orks are comparably numerous, but they need to keep fighting or they’ll turn on each other, and have some unique capabilities based on repurposed tech. The Space Marines are all about precise usage of very small numbers of fanatical killing machines, with less capacity to build up an economy. And the Eldar are stealthy glass cannons operating out of remote Craftworld bases, who spend a lot of time trying to avert galactic calamities rather than just wrecking the other species.

"Time is your biggest enemy in 2025's best mystery game. Well, time and ghosts...","I don't know about you, but I plan to spend Christmas pinned to the sofa by a 15 tog duvet, watching through the family's boxset of Poirot mysteries. The duvet alone won't be sufficient, and like a modern day Giles Corey, I'll cry ""More weight!"" at a nearby sibling until they crush me with extra blankets. Only one arm will be free from the blanket stricture. This is for operating the remote, reaching for selection box chocolates, and petting the dog. After all, nothing says cosy like ensconcing yourself before a grisly murder at a country house.

"Larian boss responds to criticism of generative AI use: ""it's something we are constantly discussing internally""","A few hours ago, reports surfaced that Larian are making use of generative AI during development of their new RPG Divinity - specifically, to come up with ideas, produce placeholder text, develop concept art, and create materials for PowerPoint presentations. In the same Bloomberg article , Larian CEO Swen Vincke sought to balance these revelations with the promise that Divinity won’t directly contain any AI-generated materials, commenting that ""everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves."" As with generative AI in gamedev generally, the disclosure has sparked anger online - anger that is all the sharper for the love that has hitherto been directed at Larian, creators of amazing fantasy RPGs with sexy bears and demons. Inevitably, some of the outrage is from people who appear minimally familiar with game development, and in a few cases, haven’t read the report in full (unhelpfully, it’s behind Bloomberg’s paywall). Some of it, though, is from other game developers.

"Larian want to complete Divinity in ""three to four years"", and they're making limited use of generative AI","Larian's new Divinity RPG should spend a lot less time in development than their previous Baldur's Gate 3 - or at least, that's the dream. CEO Swen Vincke wants the process to take ""three to four years"" in total, which seemingly includes an early access period. For context, we first heard that Larian were officially working on a new game (two, actually) back in April 2024. Here, let me run those numbers through Rock Paper Shotgun's in-house Mirror of Fate. Gosh. Assuming I have performed the rituals correctly, that means Divinity will launch out of early access in 2027 or 2028. In less positive news, Larian are reportedly making limited internal use of generative AI for tasks such as concept art development and internal presentations.

So sayeth Swen Vincke, studio CEO, in an interview with RPS following the project's bloody and bawdy announcement trailer at the Game Awards last week. Concrete specifics remain few as of writing, but I can tell you that this is perhaps more reboot than sequel. It's an attempt to firm up and clarify Divinity's narrative universe, both for returning Braccus Rex devotees and for Baldur's Gate 3 players who've yet to try Larian's non-D&D games. It's also going to allow for more ""freedom"" than any Larian game before, thanks partly to running on a new version of Larian's in-house engine tech. Ah, the eternal videogame promise of more freedom. I'm mostly just here for the piggies.

Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is both a speedrunner's dream and the perfect homage to the NES trilogy,"Many moons ago in the early '90s, I grew up with a copy of the Nintendo Power strategy guide for Ninja Gaiden II. That excellent tome contained bios on all of the game's enemies, and I recall being entranced by one in particular: a gourd-like axe-wielder named Pumpkin Head. Fast forward 35 years, and Pumpkin Head returns as one of the many villains in Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound , a spirited revival of 2D Ninja Gaiden lovingly crafted by The Game Kitchen. More specifically, he shows up in the first stage to chuck an array of blades at new hero Kenji, who wears a blue costume that's only a few degrees removed from series protagonist Ryu Hayabusa's classic attire. Frankly, Ragebound is the best that 2D Ninja Gaiden has ever been, sprinting a delicate tightrope between homaging the past and offering something new.

I didn't expect a management game like The Alters to make me question my life choices,"11 Bit Studios' sci-fi management game The Alters arrived at a point when I was unhappy with the trajectory my life was taking. But, I wasn't expecting a story about a shipwrecked astronaut and his cabal of clones to leave me questioning not just the choices I'd taken that led me down that path, but also highlighting all the choices I had left untaken along the way. That's not bad going for a game in which you spend most evenings getting hammered playing beer pong.

It's called Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic , a name that will instantly make any Knights of the Old Republic oldhead point at their screen that's Chappie style, which also happens to be a game that Hudson was project director on. The only problem with Fate of the Old Republic is that the studio that's making it only got started this year, calling into question how far away it is - a question that Hudson, kind of, answered.

"Become a forsaken nun and find absolution in the dead, almost-techno gothic horror world of Metamorphosis","There is something that lies in the belly of Metamorphosis that makes me recoil. The surface level concept is easy enough to follow. It is a 2D pixel art horror where you play as a ""forsaken nun"" who ""walks the long road to absolution."" The world you find yourself in in the game's demo is overbearing, crushing. Initially you find yourself in the depths of a church, and even that is worth questioning - what church has depths? When you come across a device, and what on the offset looks like gothic horror a la Bloodborne becomes perplexingly technological.

And yet here we are with Matthew McConaughey, a man who is happily lending his voice to some AI software , in Exodus , a game that's basically just another Mass Effect from some folks who actually made Mass Effect. But! Said folks would like you to know that McConaughey's performance is all him, thanks very much.

The Rogue Prince of Persia parkours around Hades in its own roguelite lane,"In a year where Hades II dominated the roguelite headlines, Evil Empire's The Rogue Prince of Persia slipped by largely unnoticed. This is the second time Supergiant's game overshadowed The Rogue Prince, with both titles entering early access at similar times last year. In fact, the story you may best remember of Evil Empire's game was the frothing criticism of the Prince's art style – a unique blend influenced by Arabic miniatures, Mœbius comics, and the purple-skinned sprites from the 1990 PC CGA port of the first Prince of Persia game.

The reason this line comes up is because the upcoming sequel is a violent one, one that hopes to be bloodier and gorier than its predecessor, to the point that you can, if you like, chop off any limb you can see in the game.

Gone is her shapeshifting gun too, replaced with a shapeshifting bit of metal instead. The horrors of the Oldest House have spilled out into New York City, Jesse is MIA, and Dylan must bash his way through it all to find her in a Devil May Cry -esque manner.

Granted, I haven’t been waiting quite as long as the Hollow Knight sickos. Toby Fox only kept me hanging four years for the latest slice of his episodic Undertale successor. Still, that’s before I’d started freelancing for IGN, let alone descended into the guide mines in service of my new all-knowing deity, Horace. Life has passed since I hung out with Deltarune’s adorably awkward protagonist, Kris, their chalk-devouring bestie, Susie, and the duo’s goat mage guide, Ralsie. They're like old friends at this point, and I've been frantically waiting to rejoin their excursions to the shadowy alternate universe of the Dark World. After all, I had to see what manner of quirky little weirdos its ability to distort everyday objects into sentient beings would create next.

Revealed just now at the Geoffrey Awards, the new game is called Ontos, which appears to be the Greek word for ""Being"".

Review – Radiolight (Steam/PC),"If you go down to the woods today… you’re in for a fright Radiolight is a single player first person thriller, developed and published by Kryštof Knesl. Set in the fictional town of Ashwood Creek in 1980’s America, you play as police officer Ethan Collins who is investigating the disappearance of a 14 year old boy in the national park, and the possible disappearance of park ranger Harvey Waters. The game begins at your home. You wander around looking at various items and opening drawers to get used to the controls until you go into your daughter Mia’s room, where she will give you the radio that will become one of your main tools soon enough. After your conversation with Mia you hear the phone ringing downstairs, answering it will send you to the national park on the hunt for Harvey. When you arrive at the visitors centre at the entrance to the park, you notice several things out of place and use your walkie talkie to report to Rob, your colleague. A prompt will appear on screen when you need to report something, usually over the item, but sometimes a speech bubble will appear in the top right of the screen to tell you to get on your walkie talkie. During conversations you will have multiple choices of response, you can only pick one to advance the conversation and there is a limited time to choose. Once you are done looking around the visitors centre, you take the key to the park gate and enter the woods. Radiolight takes place at night and there are no lights in the wood, so you will rely heavily on your flashlight for most of the game, this helps make the world feel much bigger than it is. There is no map or compass to follow, but the game herds you in the right direction with natural barriers and the occasional sign pointing to certain places such as the rangers cabin or an observation point. One area Radiolight excels is in its music, sound effects and its use of quiet environments. At times when wandering the woods, ominous music will start. With the low visibility due to the darkness and concentration of trees, the woods become very creepy, the sound effects make the game feel tense and you expect to jump out of your skin frequently, but the game doesn’t make heavy use of jump scares or gore, so when it does happen make sure you have a helmet on as you will hit the ceiling. I would suggest playing the game with headphones as it really enhances the experience and makes the wood feel alive, it also increases the tension you feel at being alone except for Rob on the other end of the walkie talkie. Speaking of radios, you can walk around with yours on whenever you want and tune it to different stations. There is not much choice of what to listen to but there is a music station which isn’t bad, though I didn’t listen to it much myself as it seemed out of place to me in the setting. At certain points of the game when you tune the radio, the frequency indicator will turn red and a broken voice speaks to you. This voice reminded me of Bumblebee from the Transformers films in the way that it uses male and female voices for different words while speaking, what it says could be taken as a warning or a threat, you will have to find out. The story is very well done, what starts as a regular investigation soon takes a dark turn (no pun intended) towards the supernatural. Radiolight is a slow paced game, but that suits well with the story it tells, and you get as much out of your own observation as you do from what the game gives you. There is little action in the game, and it is unlike anything I have played before, based on your use of your radio to tune to the right signal before shadowy creatures can get to you.

Review – Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted (PS5),"Fresh from the 2010s, Plant vs. Zombies has made its return to the spotlight with Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. Available on PC, PS5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, developers PopCap Games and The Lost Pixels claim that the Replanted version of the game is “bigger, brighter and crazier than before.” Plants vs. Zombies was all the rage when it was released, even I was a victim of the game’s craze. Fourteen years later, here we are testing the remastered version – the circle of life. Let’s see how this tower defense game stands up against time. The graphics for Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted are good, as would be expected of a remaster. The small cyclical animations used for the game are smooth and well done, maintaining the old school style without seeming clunky. There’s not much to say for the graphics otherwise. The style maintains the simplistic and bright visuals of the original, just in high definition. There’s a fun toggle in the settings to give the plants and/or zombies a retro pixelated style. Completely unnecessary, but a bit of wholesome fun. Audio is the same as the original game, with jazzy little jingles and shooting sound effects. It’s minimalistic and aligned with the original but again, nothing noteworthy. Gameplay was fun, and could be addicting for some. For me, this tower defense style is too repetitive and gets old fast. The nostalgia of the game still made the playthrough entertaining. The gameplay style, however, does feel foreign on a controller, as the mechanisms were designed for mobile, but it is manageable and easy still. Perfect for children, or other adults looking for a hit of nostalgia. There are very few differences between the mobile version of Plants vs. Zombies and Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. This is because, as much as they might advertise “bigger” and “better”, it is still just a remaster. The new version includes cut content which, while not featured on the mobile game, was still accessible through other methods. Multiplayer modes have been ported from early console versions of the game, allowing vs and co-op play too. There are also two additional game modes. Cloudy Days reduces the amount of sunshine/points received and R.I.P mode is a perma-death mode where failing a level resets the player to the beginning, adding difficulty tiers to the game. For those who get addicted to tower defense style games, I can imagine the rage inducing pain of losing R.I.P mode. Overall, Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted was a fun way to pass some time, but nothing special. For those who had a true connection with the original game or love nostalgic games, its worth the time but £17.99 is a steep cost for what was essentially a free mobile game. I won’t judge you if you want to spend the money on an innocent bit of fun, as it it faithful to the original mobile game. However, for myself personally I don’t see it being a game I would return to except out of extreme boredom. The game code for this review was provided by EA .

Arcade Returns in Miniature with the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player,"PAC-MAN has hit the shelves once again, marking another resurgence of the iconic yellow glutton. First making an appearance in 1980, PAC-MAN continues to be a celebrity on the gaming scene. My Arcade has collaborated with Bandai to create a miniaturised version of the classic arcade game. The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is a portable retro arcade machine fitted with a 3.5″ screen and built-in speakers. This machine boasts two game modes and two-player play in one small package. Retro gaming has lasted the test of time and remained popular amongst gamers and hipsters alike, making this a potential hit for collectors. For this review, I combined forces with mum, a 70s baby who lived through the PAC-MAN hype first hand. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● First Impressions First impressions of the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player is the packaging. The packaging is simple and maintains the theme with a simple border design shaped like the machine inside. The classic PAC-MAN logo is featured and small enough that the Joystick Player remains the main focal point. Each package contains a My Arcade Certificate of Authenticity, confirming the product is officially licensed by Bandai. This is a cool little addition, making the Joystick Player seem more valuable. Realistically, there is no serial number attached to the certificate so one could be easily faked to up value knock-offs. Still, the concept is quite fun. Build and Durability The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is incredibly light yet still sturdy. It withstood a good shake and a few (accidental) tumbles. There’s a plastic cover protecting the screen that’s printed with the PAC-MAN game scene. The game interface is simple – a screen, four buttons, and the joystick. The joystick itself has the familiar clunkiness of a life-size retro arcade machine. It’s sturdy in its socket and feels durable, rather than the cheap tacky plastic most mini machines used. The same can be said of the overall machine. It feels sturdy and well-constructed, like an actual console instead of a mini-machine Nothing but the best for PAC-MAN I suppose. The battery compartment is on the rear of the machine. This PAC-MAN machine takes four AA-battery. I was briefly surprised and annoyed by this, as I expect most electronics to be rechargeable. I then looked down and saw the USB-C port, so this electronic is indeed rechargeable using a wire most people have in possession. Audio comes from the small speaker just above the battery component. The volume is adjusted using the plus and minus shaped buttons on either side of the power switch. An audio jack is available for sound output. The power switch requires a firm push and makes an audible click, giving it that clunky retro feel. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Performance There isn’t much I can say for performance – it’s PAC-MAN, just miniature. Fans of the original, or of similar retro games, will no doubt enjoy this PAC-MAN Joystick Player. It’s true to original with the gameplay and graphics. The only difference is the pixels are much, much clearer. Players start the game by adding ‘credits’ to the machine before selecting play-mode. I struggled with directing my little PAC-MAN with the joystick, but this was simply a skill issue. Handing the game to my mum, she smashed it. Two-player mode isn’t simultaneous play. With the size of the machine, simultaneous play would be near impossible. Instead, the second player begins when the first player dies and vice versa until all lives are used up. This adds pressure to keep the game out of your friends hands and claim the highest score. Speed Up mode is the same game with added anxiety. Everything remains the same but PAC-MAN picks up speed, flying across the map. Both modes are fun, but if I continued to play on speed-up mode the Joystick Player would also be flying… out the window. Audio comes from one small speaker, giving it a tinny sound reminiscent of retro arcades. This is a nice hit of nostalgia and, similar to real arcades, only fuels the game-induced rage. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Summary Overall, the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player was a great gadget for nostalgic fun. Its portable size makes it easy to take to parties and gathering for easy entertainment. I also found it to be a great shared experience between myself and my mum, and a way to introduce new generations to the classics. The certificate of authenticity gives it a sense of legitimacy that makes it feel more valuable than just a toy. More importantly, the Joystick Player is sturdy and durable, making it fit for travel or being manhandled by a toddler. I can’t speak for how it performs over time, but so far I’m more than happy with the product.

"The reason the FCC banned this tech is chilling, and now the Nebraska AG is ripping apart the company that sold it to you anyway","Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has filed a major lawsuit against smart home company Resideo, claiming the company sold consumers insecure cameras while actively hiding their true origins, as per Tom’s Hardware . This is a big deal, especially since Resideo is a massive Honeywell spin-off with a market capitalization over $5 billion. The security risks associated with some home cameras, particularly those from more affordable brands, are becoming a known issue in the industry. The core of Hilgers’ complaint is that Resideo failed to properly tell you that the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for its cameras were Hikvision and Dahua. If those names ring a bell, they should. The U.S. government has been seriously concerned about these two Chinese companies for years. The reason for the concern is chilling. The FCC officially banned equipment from both Hikvision and Dahua back in November 2022 because of threats to national security. The lawsuit claims that Resideo sold these cameras under its own Capture brand at least from 2021 to 2022, obscuring their origin from unsuspecting buyers. It’s truly awful when you realize the camera meant to protect your family might actually be leaking video to third parties Hilgers’ lawsuit, filed in Nebraska state court, alleges that Resideo violated both the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act and the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Art. Essentially, the company is accused of selling gear known to be insecure to people who didn’t suspect a thing. That’s a huge problem for consumers who thought they were buying a secure, reliable product. It gets worse, too. Even outside of governmental concerns, security professionals have been scrutinizing equipment from both Hikvision and Dahua for almost ten years now. They weren’t just finding plain old security holes; they were finding intentional backdoors designed for remote access. This isn’t just a matter of poor software updates; this is fundamental design that puts your private data at risk. And there has been a massive data breach from private cameras , so this isn’t even a theoretical threat. ICYMI: Nebraska AG Mike Hilgers sued tech company Resideo, alleging “deceptive and unfair business practices"" involving Chinese-made cameras. From @4nsmiley and @NE_Examiner : https://t.co/vonJA19VV5 — Aaron Sanderford (@asanderford) December 24, 2025 This lawsuit against Resideo joins an ever-growing list of legal actions targeting sellers of Chinese smart devices. Just this past September, AG Hilgers filed a similar lawsuit against Lorex, another camera manufacturer whose gear you can find in major retailers like Costco and Best Buy. Lorex was reportedly marketing its cameras as “private by design,” while conveniently forgetting to mention that their OEMs were also sanctioned by the U.S. for similar security reasons. Other states are getting busy, too. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is currently suing heavy hitters like Sony, LG, Samsung, TCL, and HiSense over how they collect data, specifically citing automated TV screenshot collection. And down in Arizona, AG Kris Mayes filed a lawsuit against Temu, focusing on data collection, privacy, and counterfeiting concerns. We also just saw the FCC officially ban DJI drones, which is another huge step in limiting the use of certain Chinese technology in the U.S. Given how prevalent Chinese OEMs are inside common household electronics today, you can bet this tale is only just getting started. This is a serious warning sign that you need to be extremely careful about what brands you trust to secure your smart home.",2025-12-24T19:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/the-reason-the-fcc-banned-this-tech-is-chilling-and-now-the-nebraska-ag-is-ripping-apart-the-company-that-sold-it-to-you-anyway/
"After years of requests, HBO Max finally adds a feature fans have been begging for since 2020","HBO Max has finally given DC fans what they wanted after five years of waiting. The streaming service launched a 24/7 live channel dedicated to DC Comics content. Fans have been asking for this feature since the platform started in 2020. According to The Direct , Warner Bros. Discovery announced the new channel in a recent press release. The DC channel is now live on HBO Max alongside other 24/7 channels for The Big Bang Theory , Friends , and Harry Potter . The channel will play DC content around the clock, giving fans a constant stream of superhero shows and movies. HBO Max has become the main home for DC Comics content over the years. This became even more clear in 2024 when James Gunn’s new DC Universe arrived on the platform. Now, the service is taking another step to highlight its superhero library. The new channel gives fans easy access to decades of DC content The DC channel can pull from over 50 years of movies and TV shows. Warner Bros. did not share a specific list of what will air, but the channel will likely include recent DC Studios releases like Superman and Peacemaker . It could also feature classic films like Tim Burton’s Batman movies. The channel will probably show various DC TV series from throughout the brand’s history. Animated content will likely play a big role too, since DC has made quality animated shows and movies for decades. Fans can now tune in at any time and find something DC-related playing. The streaming world has seen similar celebrity moments recently, like when a former Nickelodeon star was spotted in an unexpected situation. HBO Max has released their 2026 hype reel. It includes the first look at DC Studios' 'LANTERNS'! pic.twitter.com/NyXk4apepi — DCU Brief (@DCUBrief) December 12, 2025 This move follows what other streaming services have already done. Disney+ introduced similar live channels a few years ago for properties like Star Wars and Marvel. These channels come and go on Disney’s platform, sometimes staying for just a few weeks. HBO Max could set itself apart by keeping its channels permanent. If the DC channel stays active for months or years, fans will always know where to find it. The service could add more channels over time instead of removing them. Entertainment moments that feel unplanned often become the most memorable, much like Breaking Bad’s only unscripted scene that became iconic. These live channels recreate the cable TV experience on streaming platforms. While streaming is built on choosing what to watch whenever you want, some viewers still enjoy having content served to them. The DC channel lets fans watch superhero content without deciding on a specific title first.",2025-12-24T18:15:00+00:00,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/movies-tv/after-years-of-requests-hbo-max-finally-adds-a-feature-fans-have-been-begging-for-since-2020/
"Fans have believed one thing about ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ for five years, now the creative director just set the record straight","A top creative director at CD Projekt Red just ended a long-running debate about Cyberpunk 2077. Igor Sarzyński cleared up a popular fan theory that has been around since before the game even launched. The theory was about the elevators in the game, and fans have been discussing it for years. Sarzyński has been with CD Projekt Red since 2011. He started as a QA tester and slowly moved up over the years. He became a cinematic designer, then a senior cinematic designer, and later a cinematic lead. In 2020, he became a cinematic director, and by January 2024, he was promoted to creative director. He directed the story for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and will help lead the next Cyberpunk game. According to Game Rant , Sarzyński posted a message on Bluesky to address the elevator theory. He explained that the elevators in Cyberpunk 2077 are not hidden loading screens, which is what many fans believed for years. This theory first appeared in September 2020 when a Reddit user suggested that elevator rides would take longer on HDD drives than SSD drives because they might be covering up loading times. The elevators exist simply because they make sense in Night City Even though CD Projekt Red developers tried to shut down this theory before, it kept coming back online. Sarzyński made it clear that elevators appear in Night City just because it makes sense for a big city to have them. He added that the game’s engine could even make the elevators see-through if they wanted. He defended the REDengine by calling it a miracle and said he would not accept any criticism of it. One user on Bluesky responded by asking why CD Projekt Red switched to Unreal Engine 5 if their own engine was so good. The studio is moving to Unreal Engine 5 for future projects like The Witcher 4 and the next Cyberpunk game. CD Projekt Red dev shuts down Cyberpunk 2077 theory that elevators in-game help hide loading times “You really think you can traverse a whole city and enter a huge complex interior with no loading screens, but we need to do elevator tricks to load a penthouse?” pic.twitter.com/3eJnShB31V — Dexerto (@Dexerto) December 23, 2025 Sarzyński replied that the studio wants to focus on making games instead of building engines. Players who want to experience what the REDengine can do can see its full potential in the current game. This matches what other CD Projekt Red leaders have said before. Charles Tremblay, the vice president of technology, explained in November 2024 that switching to Unreal Engine 5 would help the studio manage multiple projects at the same time more easily. For those exploring Night City, the game offers dozens of missions to complete throughout the story. CD Projekt Red currently has seven games in the works. Five of them are Witcher games, including The Witcher 4 , which was shown at The Game Awards 2024. The studio plans to release three new Witcher games within six years. They also have a Witcher remake being made by Fool’s Theory and a Witcher spinoff called Project Sirius in development. The studio has not announced release dates for any of these games yet.

"‘It was so, so good’: Hideo Kojima reveals the Netflix movie that made him cry, and he’s not embarrassed about it","Hideo Kojima, the famous game designer who creates dark post-apocalyptic worlds, just shared that he completely broke down while watching the Netflix animated movie KPop Demon Hunters . The 62-year-old creator is best known for the Death Stranding games, where players deliver packages through empty wastelands filled with ghost-like zombie creatures called Beached Things. His games deal with heavy and intense themes, but it turns out he has a soft side. According to Variety , Kojima posted on X this week about his emotional reaction to the film. He said he casually started watching KPop Demon Hunters, got completely hooked, and ended up crying his eyes out by the end. He later wrote a short but powerful review, saying “It was so, so good” with emotional emojis. This is a big reaction from one of gaming’s most respected creators. The storyline was not the only thing that moved him. Kojima became obsessed with the soundtrack too. He posted an image showing he was streaming “Golden,” the huge hit song by the fictional K-pop group Huntr/x from the movie. He even retweeted a post calling “Golden” the most gigantic pop song in memory, proving its massive cultural impact. The movie has become a massive global hit KPop Demon Hunters is not just popular, it is officially Netflix’s most-watched movie ever. Directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans created the film as a collaboration between Sony Pictures Animation and Netflix. If you have not seen it yet, you are missing out on a global phenomenon, and Kojima’s reaction proves it lives up to the hype. For more entertainment options, check out what’s new on Netflix this week . The movie follows the Huntr/x trio, who sell out stadiums as K-pop superstars by day. When they are off stage, they use their secret identities as demon hunters to protect their fans from supernatural threats. Their biggest challenge comes from the Saja Boys, an irresistible rival boy band that are actually demons in disguise. The premise alone sounds worth watching, and Kojima’s tearful reaction serves as a top recommendation.

Netflix continues to dominate the streaming landscape, even as the Royal Family joins Netflix with their own content ventures. Kojima can create grim post-apocalyptic worlds and still get teary-eyed over a K-pop demon hunter movie. You have to respect someone who can embrace both sides like that.

"Breaking Bad’ director calls one scene a ‘lightning strike of luck’, it was the show’s only unscripted moment and the actor never returned","The only unscripted line in the entire Breaking Bad series came from baby Holly White during the season five episode Ozymandias . The show is known for its carefully planned scripts and intense drama, so it’s amazing that the most powerful rejection of Walter White came from an unplanned moment. According to LAD Bible , Director Rian Johnson called it a “pure lightning strike of luck that you probably don’t get twice in a lifetime.” The show creator said the unscripted line and Bryan Cranston’s decision to stay in character was one of the “best performances in the whole series.” Writer Moira Walley-Beckett said the line “broke his heart wide open” and was “more than I could ever have hoped for in the writing.” The Ozymandias episode includes several intense moments, like Hank’s death and the complete fall of Walter’s meth empire. After Hank dies, Walt argues with Skyler and Walt Jr. and can’t convince them to leave with him. He takes baby Holly and drives away, kidnapping her as everything falls apart. The baby’s improvised moment changed everything for Walter White The unscripted scene happens when Walt changes Holly’s diaper in a public restroom. The actress playing Holly, Moira Bryg MacDonald, wasn’t given any lines. She was just supposed to react to her mother standing off-camera. But while Walt interacts with her, the baby looks away and keeps saying “Mama.” This moment is heartbreaking for Walt. He’s trying to hold onto the last piece of his family life, and his own baby rejects him by calling for her mother. It’s the final rejection from his family. Bryan Cranston stayed completely in character during the scene and used the improvised line, making it the emotional turning point that forces him to return Holly to Skyler before running away alone. It’s been over 13 years since the finale ended Walter White’s story from chemistry teacher to drug lord, and fans still talk about this moment. Similar to how Steve Rogers’ return sparked debate , iconic TV moments continue to resonate with audiences long after they air. Moira Bryg MacDonald made Breaking Bad history with that unforgettable unplanned line, but she didn’t continue acting afterward. She hasn’t appeared in any film or TV show since the series ended, which makes sense since she was just a baby.

Previous actresses Haven Tomlin and Elanor Anne Wenrich also haven’t had any acting credits since the show. These actors are still children, so it makes sense they’re focused on growing up and having normal childhoods instead of pursuing acting careers. MacDonald will always be remembered for delivering one of the most powerful and heartbreaking moments in the show’s history.

"Rand Paul reveals $1 million government expense that taught ferrets to binge-drink alcohol, and that wasn’t even the most insane animal experiment","Senator Rand Paul is back with his annual takedown of government spending, revealing a jaw-dropping $1.6 trillion in government waste this year, including millions spent on teaching ferrets to binge-drink alcohol and dosing dogs with cocaine, as per Fox News . The Kentucky Republican unveiled his 11th annual “Festivus Report,” detailing some truly wonky and questionable ways the federal government is dumping taxpayer dollars into pet projects and obscure studies. Paul has always been the top fiscal hawk in Congress, routinely voting against giant spending packages because he thinks Washington isn’t serious about tackling the growing debt. He believes that even when lawmakers talk tough about fiscal discipline, they just can’t help but spend more. In this report, Paul noted that the grand total of $1,639,135,969,608 includes a staggering $1.22 trillion dedicated just to interest payments on the national debt. “No matter how much taxpayer money Washington burns through, politicians can’t help but demand more,” Paul said, setting the tone for his yearly review. He continued, “So, before we get to the Feats of Strength, it’s time for my Airing of (Spending) Grievances.” Paul pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office predicts the government will add an average of $23.9 trillion in debt annually for the next decade. That means the U.S. government will be adding over $6.53 billion of debt every single day for the next ten years. If you break it down further, we’re borrowing over $75,000 every single second. The most unbelievable section of the report highlights the bizarre animal experiments funded by your money. Taxpayers forked over more than $1 million to teach “teenage ferrets to binge-drink alcohol.” And it gets worse: over $5 million was spent to dose dogs with cocaine, and roughly $13 million was dedicated to continuing experiments on beagles. If that wasn’t weird enough, the government also spent over $14 million to teach monkeys how to play a game inspired by the classic show “The Price is Right.” It’s not just animal research that made the list. The report highlighted several programs where money was funneled into projects that completely miss the mark on priorities. For example, Congress previously allocated over $7 billion to build electric vehicle charging stations nationwide. The catch? So far, only 68 have actually been built. That’s an awful return on investment for the amount of cash involved, especially after a major US car manufacturer pulled the plugs on its EV future . ""We borrow over $272 million every hour, we borrow $4.54 million every minute, and we borrow over $75,000 every second.""

Schools received nearly $200 billion in relief money, which was then spent on things like renting out MLB stadiums, paying for rooms at Caesars Palace, and even buying ice cream trucks. Other programs focused on human behavior were equally head-scratching. The government spent over $40 million to hire social media influencers to promote getting the COVID-19 vaccine, specifically targeting racial and ethnic minority groups. Another over $1 million was spent to hire celebrity influencers for anti-drug campaigns targeting “Latinx” communities. Researchers also received over $2 million just to take saliva swabs at electronic dance music festivals in New York City. Paul did laud moves taken by the Trump administration to slash government spending, noting a nearly $9 billion rescissions package that cut funding for public broadcasting and some foreign aid. While he called that action “a good start,” he quickly added that it was “just a drop in the bucket” compared to the tsunami of new debt Congress creates every year, like the “Big Beautiful Bill” that he criticized previously .",2025-12-23T23:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/rand-paul-reveals-1-million-government-expense-that-taught-ferrets-to-binge-drink-alcohol-and-that-wasnt-even-the-most-insane-animal-experiment/
"The studio behind ‘Silent Hill 2’ remake is working on something for Nintendo, and says it’s doing what no horror game has done before","Bloober Team, the studio that made the Silent Hill 2 remake, Cronos , and Layers of Fear , has shared new details about its secret Nintendo game called Project M . The company is keeping most information hidden, but they dropped some interesting hints about what players can expect. According to Video Games Chronicle , CEO Piotr Babieno said the game will appeal to fans of Resident Evil , Silent Hill , Limbo , and Eternal Darkness . “What I can say is this: fans of Resident Evil , Silent Hill , Limbo , and Eternal Darkness will immediately feel at home.,” Babieno revealed. “That said, Project M introduces a bold twist; one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware.” Babieno admitted it’s very difficult for him to keep the project secret, but said it’s still too early to reveal everything. However, he promised fans will get the first official details very soon. The CEO described Project M as a game where horror fans will feel comfortable right away. But there’s a major twist that makes it different from anything else. He said this unique feature has never been explored in any horror game before, and it can only happen on Nintendo’s system. The game promises a horror experience never seen before Bloober first mentioned Project M in a Polish interview last summer. Back then, Babieno said the team is working with some of the best Nintendo game creators in the world, so they can’t just make an average game. The studio has proven its horror expertise through the Silent Hill series chronologically . The studio founder is a huge Nintendo fan. He actually started Bloober Team because he wanted to make games for Nintendo. When asked which classic franchise he’d want to work on without any limits, Babieno mentioned Eternal Darkness again.

A video game just generated so much wealth for one province that the government immediately launched a massive new campaign to capitalize on it,"In 2024, Game Science’s Black Myth: Wukong became not only China’s first major blockbuster video game but also a cultural phenomenon that reshaped the tourism industry, as per Travel and Tour World . This action-packed game, which draws inspiration from Chinese folklore, has resulted in a distinct and thriving link between virtual exploration and real-world tourism. The game’s impact, particularly in China’s Shanxi Province, is being hailed as a pioneering example of “player to tourist conversion”, in which gamers who explored these virtual worlds transformed into actual visitors eager to explore the real-life locations depicted in the game. The game’s virtual world is rich with 36 locations that bear a strong resemblance to historical and cultural sites in Shanxi. Of these, 27 are directly inspired by real-world locations, such as ancient temples, lush landscapes, and monumental structures. The region, known for its long history and rich cultural heritage, has seen a remarkable surge in tourist visits. The once virtual locations have transformed into real-world destinations, with enthusiasts travelling across the globe to experience these sites firsthand. This phenomenon has been labelled “player to tourist conversion”, and the results speak volumes about the power of the gaming industry Within just two months of the game’s blockbuster release , ticket sales for Shanxi’s historical sites skyrocketed, surpassing 160 million yuan (approximately $22.7 million USD). This unprecedented spike in revenue was not limited to historical sites alone. Local hotels, restaurants, retail outlets, and transportation services also experienced substantial growth. The game has directly contributed to a wider economic boom in the region, turning Shanxi into a travel hotspot. Search engines recorded a staggering 3,178% increase in queries related to “Shanxi tourism” compared to the year before the game’s release. The game’s virtual settings, coupled with the increased visibility from social media channels, triggered an overwhelming wave of public interest. Social media platforms dedicated to the game and Shanxi’s tourism scene collectively received over 40 billion views, further highlighting the scale of interest.

Tourism organizations in the region swiftly incorporated elements from Black Myth: Wukong into their promotional strategies. New tourism plans and campaigns were designed to meet the growing demand for immersive experiences. These initiatives included creating travel packages, guided tours of in-game locations, and collaborations with local businesses to offer specialized services for gamers. Additionally, Shanxi’s government began working closely with the gaming community to showcase the region’s cultural significance within the context of the game, further solidifying the relationship between digital culture and tangible experiences. Beyond the influence on tourism, the game also sparked cultural engagements within China’s art and exhibition scenes. The Art Museum of China Academy of Art in Hangzhou hosted a special exhibition dedicated to the game. Initially planned to run for just 40 days, the exhibit’s overwhelming popularity led to its extension for an additional 68 days, totalling an impressive 108 days. During its run, the exhibition welcomed a staggering 450,000 visitors, far exceeding initial expectations. Despite daily visitor caps ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 people, the exhibit became a cultural milestone, demonstrating how video games, often seen as entertainment mediums, can deeply influence art and heritage tourism and economic growth.",2025-12-23T23:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/gaming/a-video-game-just-generated-so-much-wealth-for-one-province-that-the-government-immediately-launched-a-massive-new-campaign-to-capitalize-on-it/
ICE warns migrants to ‘avoid Santa’s naughty list’ in bizarre video featuring Father Christmas making arrests,"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement released an unusual propaganda video on Monday night that has ignited widespread controversy across social media platforms. The bizarre holiday-themed clip depicts Santa Claus as an immigration enforcement agent who arrests and deports undocumented migrants, transforming the beloved Christmas figure into a symbol of federal deportation operations. According to the NY Post , the video was posted on X as part of a coordinated messaging campaign aimed at encouraging undocumented immigrants to voluntarily leave the United States. The agency’s decision to weaponize Christmas imagery for immigration enforcement purposes represents a dramatic departure from traditional government communications, blending holiday cheer with hardline deportation messaging. The footage features a dramatically reimagined Father Christmas who bears little resemblance to the jolly gift-giver of tradition. Instead of a rotund, cheerful figure in a simple red suit, this version of Santa appears as a muscular, tactical enforcement officer wearing a distinctive red bulletproof vest emblazoned with the ICE logo, creating a jarring fusion of holiday symbolism and federal law enforcement. The holiday deportation incentive comes with a cash bonus Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled a controversial new initiative on Monday designed to encourage voluntary departures of undocumented immigrants through substantial financial incentives. The program, officially titled “Home for the Holidays,” represents a significant escalation in the federal government’s strategy to reduce the undocumented population through economic inducements rather than forced removals. ICE posted the Santa video with a message telling migrants to avoid the “naughty list.” They encouraged people to use the CBP Home app to self-deport, earn the $3,000, and spend Christmas at home with their families. The holiday incentive runs through the end of 2025. Immigrants should also be aware of their legal rights during ICE encounters . AVOID ICE AIR AND SANTA’S NAUGHTY LIST!

This substantial figure represents one of the largest waves of self-deportation in recent American history, reflecting the combined impact of heightened enforcement rhetoric, increased immigration raids, and financial incentive programs designed to encourage migrants to leave without formal removal proceedings. Officials say paying people to leave on their own is cheaper than forced deportation. The government claims it costs an average of $17,000 to arrest, detain, and deport each illegal migrant. The self-deportation program aims to reduce these costs while encouraging voluntary departures. However, the devastating impact of deportation on immigrants remains a serious concern for many families.",2025-12-23T22:45:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/ice-warns-migrants-to-avoid-santas-naughty-list-in-bizarre-video-featuring-father-christmas-making-arrests/
"A group ripped 300TB of content off Spotify to make the largest public music ‘preservation archive’, but the company is coming to ruin the whole thing","Spotify has officially responded to Anna’s Archive’s massive music scraping project, confirming they have identified and disabled the “nefarious user accounts” responsible for the unlawful data theft, as per Android Authority . This response is definitely aggressive and shows the company isn’t messing around when it comes to copyright issues. The platform released a statement addressing the claims, “Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping. We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior. Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.” So, what exactly did Anna’s Archive pull off to warrant this official counter-attack? This group, which you might know better for backing up books and research papers, claims it scraped almost the entirety of the music streaming giant. This is an enormous archive, weighing in at just under 300TB. The group says they archived metadata for 256 million tracks and audio files for 86 million songs. They insist this coverage represents around 99.6% of all listens on Spotify. If that sounds enormous, it is Anna’s Archive says this database is now the largest publicly available music metadata database in the entire world. The group is trying to frame this massive data rip as a “preservation archive” for modern music. They argue that while the super-popular songs are probably backed up everywhere, huge chunks of lesser-known music could totally disappear if streaming platforms lose licenses or unexpectedly shut down. They said this is “a great start” for preserving modern music history. Let’s be clear: this project is not legal. Spotify licenses almost all of its music from rights holders and record labels under strict legal terms. Mass-scraping these files and then redistributing them via bulk torrents violates Spotify’s terms of service. Worse, it violates copyright law in many countries. Copyright law generally doesn’t make exceptions for something like “good intentions,” even if Anna’s Archive is genuinely worried about preservation rather than just straight-up piracy. World’s largest shadow library made a 300TB copy of Spotify’s most streamed songs https://t.co/HZ0uiD1wAW — Liberation Technology (@Liberationtech) December 23, 2025 The technical side of the archive is interesting, though. The audio itself mostly comes straight from Spotify. To save space, popular tracks are stored in their original 160kbps format, but less-played songs were re-encoded into smaller files. Right now, only the metadata is fully available to the public. The actual music files are being released gradually, starting with the most popular tracks first. You should also know that anything released after July 2025 may be missing from this massive archive. Before this recent statement, Spotify had indicated they had identified “that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform’s audio files.” That older statement avoided confirming the sheer scale that Anna’s Archive described. Spotify now says only “some” of its audio files were accessed, which contradicts Anna’s Archive’s audacious claim that they archived music covering 99.6% of all listens. It’s completely unclear how much of the platform was truly affected or whether Spotify and the major record companies will pursue full legal action to yank the scraped data off the torrent networks. We have seen crackdowns on some anime piracy sites in recent years . While they can’t do much about AI music , we’ll definitely have to wait and see if they can put the genie back in the bottle on this one.",2025-12-23T22:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/a-group-ripped-300tb-of-content-off-spotify-to-make-the-largest-public-music-preservation-archive-but-the-company-is-coming-to-ruin-the-whole-thing/
"A$AP Rocky tries to promote his new album on Reddit, mods keep deleting his posts and he’s not happy about it","A$AP Rocky is angry because Reddit moderators keep removing his posts about his new album, Don’t Be Dumb. The rapper tried to share his music directly with fans on subreddits like r/HipHopHeads, but the posts kept getting deleted. This frustrated the “Long Live A$AP” artist, who thought connecting with fans on Reddit would be simple. Many musicians use social media platforms like X, Instagram, and Facebook to promote new releases. Rocky decided to try Reddit to reach dedicated fan communities. However, he quickly ran into problems with the platform’s strict rules about self-promotion. According to Dexerto , Rocky didn’t hide his anger when his Reddit posts kept disappearing. He wrote in all caps: “MODS STOP DELETING MY COMMENTS.” He questioned whether artists need to “CHECK IN WITH MODS TO PUSH THEY MUSIC 4 FANS?” He ended his complaint with his album title: “DON’T BE DUMB.” Even celebrities can’t escape Reddit’s self-promotion rules The deletions weren’t limited to text posts. Rocky also tried uploading videos, but those were removed immediately too. “IT WAS UP FOR 1 SECOND. AUTO TAKEDOWN,” he said. Some fans made fun of the moderators for blocking the actual artist from sharing his own music. Rocky later claimed he was following the rules, writing “DONT BE DUMB I FOLLOW THE RULES.” The problem likely happened because of a missing step in the promotion process. When big artists want to promote music on Reddit, their record labels or PR teams usually contact the subreddit moderators first. This coordination makes sure the posts don’t look like spam and don’t break the community’s self-promotion rules.

Reddit’s strict enforcement has caused similar issues before with community guidelines and platform policies. Rocky isn’t new to Reddit. His ASAPRocky account has been active for a while. He has used the platform before to praise other artists and hint at new music. Despite this history, he still couldn’t avoid the platform’s strict self-promotion policies this time. The incident shows how even celebrities can face unexpected challenges on social media platforms, much like when content creators encounter chaotic situations .

These kinds of community controversies spread quickly online, particularly when content creators’ actions spark public debate about what’s appropriate to share . Even famous celebrities with millions of fans must follow Reddit’s standard rules when trying to reach their audience. It’s a hard lesson for artists using these platforms.

"Proposed Trump administration rules will destroy everything the Endangered Species Act saved, including this iconic animal that almost went extinct","Conservation advocate and popular streamer Maya Higa just used her massive platform on TikTok to call out the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) put forward by the Trump administration. Higa urged her viewers to listen up because the administration’s plans could seriously harm wildlife that is already struggling to survive. In her video , Higa explained that these rules are explicitly designed to roll back crucial protections under the ESA. If these plans go through, oil, gas, logging, and mining companies could basically dictate habitat protection. Higa warned that land, climate, and animal welfare concerns will inevitably take a back seat, “no matter what the costs are to wildlife and to our climate and to our lands.” She didn’t mince words about the situation, saying plainly, “It sucks.” This proposed rollback is especially frustrating because the ESA is the country’s strongest tool for protecting species at risk. Higa pointed to clear successes, noting that hundreds of species almost went extinct but didn’t because of the ESA. Think about the bald eagle, the black-footed ferret, and the gray wolf. These are, in fact, not African animals , but iconic animals of this land that we’d hate to lose, and the protections need to stay in place to ensure that. When Higa talks about conservation, you should definitely listen up Besides being a content creator, Higa is the founder and executive director of Alveus Sanctuary in central Texas. She’s worked as a licensed falconer, a wildlife rehabilitator, a zookeeper, and a conservation educator. Plus, she’s recognized as one of Twitch’s top female streamers, in contrast to some of her more questionable counterparts . You might even remember her from her incredibly viral livestreams featuring Winnie the Cow, who famously began demanding that Twitch viewers donate to give her treats. Higa’s streams often combine education with major fundraising efforts. For example, her conservation podcast back in 2019 raised over $92,000 for various conservation groups. Her track record shows she knows what she’s talking about when it comes to saving animals. @maya_higa pls click the link in my bio to help ♬ original sound – maya_higa Higa opened her recent video with a straightforward appeal to her followers. “Hey, guys, I meant to talk to you about this sooner,” she said, explaining that she felt compelled to speak immediately. She stressed that wildlife already has it really, really freaking hard, so threats that make it harder are simply unacceptable. The good news is that these proposed rules aren’t final yet. Higa strongly encouraged people to take public action right away. We have until December 22 to show that the public overwhelmingly supports protecting wildlife. She framed participation as a simple but incredibly meaningful step, urging people to submit comments through the link in her bio. Asking viewers to participate, she added, “That’s my Christmas present.” She emphasized that it’s crucial to act now and ensure that this vital piece of legislation continues to protect the animals that need it most.",2025-12-23T22:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/proposed-trump-administration-rules-will-destroy-everything-the-endangered-species-act-saved-including-this-iconic-animal-that-almost-went-extinct/
"A man says he lived an ‘entire different life’ in a dream and remembers everything, including something dark about Trump’s future","A man on Reddit claims he lived 51 years inside a dream and saw something disturbing happen to President Donald Trump in 2027. While most people’s dreams are boring and forgettable, this person says he experienced an entirely different life and remembers almost everything from it. According to Unilad , the Reddit post went up on December 22, and the man shared detailed memories from his dream life. He even remembered specific details like his wife’s appearance. She was 5’4″ with blonde hair and blue eyes, and he said she looked like a female version of Kurt Cobain, the famous Nirvana singer. In the dream, he married her in 2028 when he was 28 years old. When someone asked if he remembered any political events, he shared a dark prediction about Trump’s future. He claims that in his dream, Trump gets assassinated in 2027 during an international trip to Japan. According to his account, a sniper attacks Trump at the airport when he lands to meet with Takaichi. The shooter is never caught but is believed to be a member of the US military. The dream included wild predictions about American politics After Trump’s death in the dream, JD Vance finishes the presidential term but loses the next election to California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom then serves two terms as president. After him, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez serves one term, followed by Pete Buttigieg who serves two terms. This would mean the Democratic Party wins five presidential terms in a row. However, the dreamer later added that Newsom and Buttigieg actually split from the Democrats and created a new political party. Still, five straight terms for one party would be historic. The current record is four consecutive terms between 1933 and 1945, which was also achieved by Democrats. Trump has recently made controversial decisions, including declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction , which drew immediate criticism. The man explained that he felt like he lived every single second of those 51 years. But just like real life, he doesn’t remember everything perfectly. He compared it to trying to remember what you ate for breakfast seven years ago. The memories exist but some details fade over time. He described the experience as feeling unreal and hard to explain. He said it felt like he was living in another person’s body rather than having two separate identities. The dream version had a similar personality to him, and he thinks they would have been good friends in real life. Meanwhile, in real-world politics, Trump’s envoy outlined controversial plans for Greenland that sparked international debate. One Reddit user suggested this could be lucid dreaming, where people sometimes have trouble telling the difference between real events and dream events. When someone asked if it was a happy life, the dreamer simply replied that it was very happy and he smiles when thinking back on it.",2025-12-23T21:45:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/a-man-says-he-lived-an-entire-different-life-in-a-dream-and-remembers-everything-including-something-dark-about-trumps-future/
"She spent months finding the perfect wedding accessory for her fiancé, then he asked one brutal question that ripped her heart out","TikTok user Ella Richman recently shared the story of a major Christmas gift fail after her fiancé openly disliked the expensive, thoughtful present she bought him. The viral video , which has racked up over 1.6 million views, shows how good intentions don’t always translate into a gift the other person actually wants. Ella and her fiancé, Sam, are set to tie the knot next September, and she admitted that she bought him what she genuinely thought was the most perfect holiday gift, only for him to hate it immediately. The tricky part of this whole situation is that Ella knew her fiancé’s style preferences well. She said he is someone who absolutely does not adorn himself, explaining that he doesn’t wear a watch, hates logos, and wants his sense of style to be very muted. Because of his minimalist taste, she was especially excited about one specific detail for their wedding: cuff links. This was going to be the first and only jewelry-type thing she’d ever be able to get him to wear, she figured, since you need to wear cuff links with a tux. I totally get why she thought this was the perfect opportunity to buy him something meaningful that they could both appreciate. Ella wanted something special yet subtle that would fit both him and their Hamptons wedding vibe She spent months researching options, comparing vintage pieces with new designs. She finally landed on a shop in New York City called The Missing Link, which is famous for providing vintage cuff links often featured in film and TV productions. The gift she chose was a pair of 14-karat gold cuff links from the 1940s that featured a very light blue, almost gray stone. They even came with matching shirt buttons. Then came the moment of truth. Sam opened the box and gave a truly brutal reaction. Ella recounted the exact question he asked: “What about me makes you think that I would like these?” He also told her that he thought the cuff links were “girly.” That is awful for someone who spent so much time and effort trying to get the perfect gift, especially when she was hoping he might just need time to come around to them. @ella.richman Sorry I’m long winded but can I get some hype for these please we need to convince Sam to keep them #weddinggift #boyfriendgifts ♬ original sound – ella After Ella posted the video hoping for reassurance, many viewers sadly sided with Sam. While it didn’t reach the Auschwitz birthday cake territory , one person mocked the situation pretty directly, saying, “Bro got … cuff links for Christmas.” Another commenter pointed out the mismatch between effort and intent, writing, “You spoke about why the gift was perfect for the wedding, but not about why it’s perfect for him.” Ouch, that’s a tough pill to swallow, but the consensus was clear. One viewer stated, “You’re thinking of the wedding, not him and his likes.” Others were even more blunt, with one saying, “I hate siding with a man but girl u got those for u not him.” Another commenter noted that being loved is about being seen, suggesting, “This gift made him feel invisible from a woman he recently proposed to. Yikes.” This whole ordeal is a prime example of why gifting can be so difficult, even when you know someone intimately.

"Trump makes bizarre claim about US history while discussing Greenland takeover, apparently 1776 slipped his mind","President Trump made a major historical mistake this week when he said the United States has been around for 300 years. He made this error on Monday while talking about his plans to acquire Greenland. During a press conference, Trump announced that Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, would serve as a special envoy to the territory. According to The London Economic , Trump compared the possible Greenland deal to the Louisiana Purchase, when the US bought that large area from France in 1803. He called Landry a “deal-maker type guy,” which shows he wants serious negotiations to start soon. The president clearly still wants to add Greenland to American territory. Things went wrong when Trump started questioning why Greenland still belongs to Denmark. He said Denmark has spent no money on the territory and provides no military protection. Then he made his historical error. Trump claimed, “They say that Denmark was there 300 years ago with a boat, well, we were there with boats too I’m sure.” The president’s timeline is off by several decades If you do the math, 300 years ago would be 1725. That’s a serious mistake because the United States wasn’t founded until 1776. This means the country is currently about 249 years old, not 300. The difference matters a lot when comparing national histories. In 1725, the territory that would become the United States was still a collection of British colonies. There was no unified government, no Constitution, and no independent nation. The American Revolution wouldn’t begin for another 50 years. The real history of Greenland makes Trump’s error even worse. Norse Vikings reached Greenland around 985 AD. Denmark set up colonies there in 1721. This means Denmark was actively colonizing Greenland more than 50 years before the USA even existed as an independent nation.

"A woman demanded a late-night McDonald’s meal, and the staff’s bizarre response was policy-breaking chaos","TikTok user Kae (@kae_doll) managed to score a bizarre, policy-breaking late-night meal after convincing McDonald’s staff to sell her frozen Filet-O-Fish patties instead of cooking them, as reported by BroBible . Kae posted a video showing herself outside the location, confirming she was able to pay for a box containing a stack of uncooked fish patties. It seems the staff just really wanted to close up shop and go home. There’s a huge, ongoing online debate about whether it’s rude to visit a store right before closing time. While technically allowed, many customers agree that it’s just bad manners, and I think they have a point. Closing a store involves tons of extra work, and employees usually want to finish these critical steps as fast as possible to clock out. When you show up right before the doors shut, you’re delaying their final departure time, and nobody wants that. Some stores try to manage this by advertising that their “last sale” occurs before their actual closing time. However, this McDonald’s location found a far more unorthodox solution. Kae’s approach to this late-night dilemma was definitely outside the norm She explained in the video that the staff was not interested in making the fish sandwich. She told them, “f* it, give me the fish fillets. I’m gonna cook it at home.” You can tell she really loves her Filet-O-Fish, continuing, “I love me a fish fillet. Like, I don’t give a f*.” She summarized the situation in a text overlay on the video: “POV : McDonald’s didn’t want to cook anymore fish filets late night so you paid for some frozen patties.” In a follow-up video , Kae confirmed she was successful in deep-frying the patties at home. Not only did she get the frozen fish, but the restaurant also provided her with the necessary extras. They gave her buns, tartar sauce, and fries “for the inconvenience.” That’s actually a pretty solid customer service move, even if it completely breaks the rules of the store without breaching the territory of the free food loophole . @kae_doll yall want one? #fyp #fy #mcdonalds #food #foodtiktok ♬ original sound – KAEDOLL And breaking the rules is exactly what this was. You generally can’t just walk into a McDonald’s and buy frozen ingredients. While chains sometimes sell their own branded retail products, like packaged coffee, they absolutely do not allow customers to purchase frozen versions of menu items like McNuggets or fish filets from their stores. Current and former employees commenting on Reddit confirmed that selling frozen items goes against corporate policy, usually due to obvious liability reasons. This is a massive risk for the company. If you buy frozen food and cook it incorrectly at home, the company doesn’t want to be responsible for any resulting issues. It’s highly likely the specific location Kae visited simply ignored the rules in this one instance just to get her out the door and start their closing procedures. I guess we can forgive them, especially with the worsening work conditions for workers across fast food chains .",2025-12-23T21:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/a-woman-demanded-a-late-night-mcdonalds-meal-and-the-staffs-bizarre-response-was-policy-breaking-chaos/
"‘The Voice’ alum who kissed Christina Aguilera arrested after multi-state manhunt, and TikTok fans helped track her down","Kata Hay, a former contestant from singing competition show The Voice , was arrested in Oklahoma. Police had been searching for her across multiple states because of a vehicular homicide warrant. She is now being held at the Osage County Jail. According to AOL , the Goodlettsville Police Department had asked for public help to find Hay just one day before her arrest. They posted her photo online a day before her arrest, showing the 38-year-old wearing a black-and-white prison jumpsuit. The charges against her are connected to a car crash that happened in Davidson County, Tennessee. Police said Hay’s arrest happened after investigators received numerous tips from the public about her whereabouts. TikTok users proved instrumental in locating her by monitoring her social media activity and promptly relaying crucial information to law enforcement authorities. TikTok sleuths became unexpected heroes in this criminal case Law enforcement officials credited the vigilant online community for their role in the arrest, noting that the volume and quality of tips they received significantly accelerated the investigation. Hay is currently charged as a fugitive from justice. She is waiting to be sent back to Tennessee to face the vehicular homicide charge. Her legal name is Kata Huddleston. Many people remember Hay from her appearance on The Voice in 2016. She auditioned with the song Redneck Woman by Gretchen Wilson. Almost all the coaches turned their chairs around, except Blake Shelton. Similar to other celebrity legal troubles, YouTube star Jack Doherty’s recent arrest also made headlines after police found something in his possession.

During the pitch session, she told Aguilera that the famous singer was her first “girl crush.” Aguilera responded by suggesting they should “just make out now” to “get it over with so we can get to work.” The two then kissed on stage, creating a memorable moment. Hay made it to the Top 20 before getting eliminated. Since leaving the show, Hay has faced several legal problems. In 2022, she was arrested in Sumner County, Tennessee, for having sexual contact with a minor. She pleaded guilty and served a six-month sentence. This case joins other shocking criminal cases, like when a 7-year-old boy was discovered in a freezer under horrifying circumstances. When Hay was arrested in 2022, she was already on probation for a DUI charge from 2017.

The FBI looked away and now this designated neo-Nazi terror cell headed by an ex-Pentagon contractor is training openly in the US,"The neo-Nazi terrorist group known as the Base, once a major target for FBI counter-terrorism efforts, is openly escalating its operations and calling for an armed insurgency right here in the United States, as per The Guardian . While the group has been busy expanding its reach into Europe, new online activities show that the US remains its operational nerve center, with cells actively training and preparing for violence. The group is headed by Rinaldo Nazzaro, an ex-Pentagon contractor who is reportedly now a Russian intelligence asset. He recently released an audio recording bragging about the Base’s long-term strategic goal. Nazzaro said, “Our long-term strategic goal is to accomplish something similar to what al-Qaida and IS accomplished in Syria.” He wants to “Form an organized, armed insurgency to take and hold territory. And establish a white homeland which we control and govern.” He concluded that only two traditionally white nations possess all the necessary prerequisites for this goal: Ukraine and the United States. This isn’t just empty talk; the Base has an active footprint here. Videos released in November show masked men shooting military-style rifles and pistols in what they claim is an Appalachian forest. Another June photo from that same Appalachian cell captures five armed men in skull masks holding rifles and brandishing the Base’s black flag. We’ve also seen a mid-Atlantic cell performing “Sieg Heil” salutes and a Midwest cell firing pistols It looks like the Base feels free to organize and prepare for their objective of fomenting an armed insurgency against the US government. This is happening because the FBI, under the shifting political climate of the second Trump administration, has openly rerouted resources away from investigating far-right extremists . Several sources have noted that the FBI has looked away from what is statistically the most dangerous domestic terrorist threat facing the US, even mocking it as part of a “woke” agenda. Nazzaro has explicitly expanded his endorsement of violence, calling for the establishment of “acceleration teams.” Steven Rai, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) who monitors the group, described this as a “troubling escalation.” These teams are aimed at destabilizing society and weakening government authority through attacks on critical infrastructure. When the Base and other far-right groups strike, Trump and Kash will have even more American blood on their hands. This is why the whole ""foreign and domestic"" threat is in the oath. ""Neo-Nazi terror group steps up US operations as FBI pulls back"" https://t.co/Gc8r9r9gt5 — Am I a cat? You decide. (@CatGrah17554541) December 23, 2025 On VKontakte, a Russian social media platform where the Base maintains an account, the group explicitly called for cells to use “targeted attacks on essential infrastructure and resources.” They believe these consistent attacks could contribute to the country’s political fragmentation over time, which has been a theme even across the Atlantic ocean . The Base’s international activity shows just how serious the threat is. The European Union has declared it a terrorist group, putting it in the same league as Islamic State and al-Qaida. Its Ukrainian wing is linked to multiple acts of terrorism, including the high-profile July assassination of an intelligence officer in Kyiv, and this cell is seen by the Base as a model of active insurgency. The Base is no longer just an obscure American problem, especially with legitimate questions surrounding its links to Russian sabotage operations. Nazzaro even mentioned in his audio clip that he sees instability in “Canada or the European Union” as promising for recruitment, in his first explicit mention of Canadian activities in years. However, analyst Steven Rai thinks Nazzaro may have inadvertently increased the group’s exposure to intervention by law enforcement. Rai pointed out that by providing Base operatives in the United States with explicit strategic guidance centered around violence, Nazzaro might just provide the legal space authorities need to crack down on this designated terrorist organization.",2025-12-23T20:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/the-fbi-looked-away-and-now-this-designated-neo-nazi-terror-cell-headed-by-an-ex-pentagon-contractor-is-training-openly-in-the-us/
"Texas high school football player facing charges after allegedly shooting teammate, but his explanation to police raises questions","Xavier Mayfield, an 18-year-old high school football player, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after he allegedly shot a teammate in the neck. The incident happened just hours after their championship victory. Mayfield plays safety for South Oak Cliffs High School in Dallas. According to People , the shooting took place at a home on the 6400 block of Knoll Ridge Drive in Dallas. The victim, whose name has not been released, was shot in the neck and taken to a local hospital. He is now in stable condition. Mayfield is being held in Dallas County Jail with his bond set at $50,000. Mayfield’s story to police has raised serious questions about what actually happened that night. He told officers he was on the second floor of the house, walking from the bathroom to his bedroom, when the victim called his name. According to Mayfield, he turned around and a single shot went off from the AR-style rifle he was holding. Carrying an AR-style rifle between rooms seems highly suspicious The key issue here is why Mayfield was carrying an AR-style rifle while simply moving between a bathroom and bedroom. This detail makes his claim of an accidental shooting very hard to believe. It’s extremely unusual for someone to be walking around a house with that type of weapon for no clear reason. After the shooting, Mayfield said he tried to drive the victim to the hospital himself and called 911 before leaving the house. While this shows he was concerned about getting help quickly, it doesn’t explain why he had the weapon in the first place or how it discharged. In other legal news, a Texas rancher faces a lawsuit from State Farm over a confusing dispute.

They confirmed the victim was Mayfield’s teammate and insisted there was no intent to harm anyone. Even if this was truly an accident, the charges reflect how serious it is to have an AR-style rifle go off and injure someone in the neck. Mayfield should have been celebrating his team’s championship win, but instead he’s sitting in jail facing major legal problems. The shocking nature of the charges mirrors other disturbing cases where seemingly innocent situations turned into serious criminal matters. This case will likely get a lot of attention from the community as more details come out.

"Following Bill Cinton’s hot tub photo reveal, former president’s top aide slams DOJ instead, claiming ‘someone or something is being protected’","Bill Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Ureña, is publicly demanding that the Department of Justice release all remaining documents related to the former president in files concerning Jeffrey Epstein, claiming that “someone or something is being protected,” as per The Hill . This strong statement, which Ureña made Monday on X, comes just days after the DOJ released an initial batch of controversial photos involving President Clinton. If you were wondering why the Clinton team is suddenly pushing so hard for transparency, it’s because the initial document dump featured some pretty eyebrow-raising images. One photo shows President Clinton sitting in a hot tub with an unidentified person . Another image shows a hidden-identity woman sitting directly on his lap. It’s important to note that President Clinton has not actually been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or his awful sex-trafficking ring. Despite the lack of formal accusations, Ureña is adamant that the public needs to see everything the DOJ has. He cited the Epstein Files Transparency Act, saying the department is required to “produce the full and complete record the public demands and deserves.” Congressional lawmakers echo Ureña’s accusation against the DOJ Ureña didn’t hold back his personal assessment of the situation, either. He believes that the manner in which the DOJ released the documents, along with the information it has provided so far, makes one thing perfectly clear.”Someone or something is being protected,” Ureña stated. “We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection.” It turns out that congressional lawmakers are echoing Ureña’s frustrations. Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, who co-sponsored the transparency law, have already criticized the DOJ. They believe the department isn’t releasing everything it holds on Epstein and has been redacting too many names of individuals mentioned within the files . pic.twitter.com/tk4Tki6Wp1 — Angel Ureña (@angelurena) December 22, 2025 The official stance from President Clinton’s team has remained consistent. Just last Friday, Ureña had posted that President Clinton was among those who “knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light.” This whole situation gets a little more complex when you look at the historical context. Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Epstein’s accomplice, was honored at a Clinton Global Initiative event in 2013. This is noteworthy because that event happened years after Maxwell had already been accused of assisting the disgraced financier in his crimes. It seems like we’re nowhere near the end of this story. With President Clinton’s deputy chief of staff demanding full transparency and bipartisan lawmakers agreeing that the DOJ is hiding documents, the pressure is mounting for the department to release the unredacted truth. You can bet the House committee is going to be watching closely as that December 17 deadline approaches.",2025-12-23T20:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/following-bill-cintons-hot-tub-photo-reveal-former-presidents-top-aide-slams-doj-instead-claiming-someone-or-something-is-being-protected/
"JD Vance completes intense Navy SEAL training session in California, but there’s one detail about his appearance that breaks the rules","Vice President JD Vance finished a tough 90-minute beach workout with Navy SEALs in California. The training included running, rope climbing, and carrying heavy logs. But the most interesting part was that Vance was the only person in the photos who had a beard, which goes against a new military policy. According to the NY Post , the workout happened at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, where SEALs do their famous Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training, called BUD/S. This training is extremely hard, and only about 20% of people make it through “Hell Week.” Even though the SEALs went easier on him, Vance said he still felt destroyed after the session. The Marine veteran posted on X saying, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train.” He thanked the Armed Forces for keeping the country safe and maintaining the highest standards in the world. Vance gets special treatment while others follow strict grooming rules This situation is interesting because War Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a policy in August that stops most service members from having beards. Hegseth said “no more beardos” and wants all military members to be “fit, not fat.” Vance has praised Hegseth for pushing these high standards, but clearly doesn’t follow the same rules himself. Vance talked about this policy in October. He said when he was a young Marine, he did not have a beard. But he explained that as vice president, he operates under different rules. Vance simply said, “I get to do what I want to do.” The vice president has faced criticism over controversial comments in recent months. Just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes (I'll post some photos when I get them). They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world! — JD Vance (@JDVance) December 22, 2025 The vice president is following a similar pattern as Hegseth, who often posts videos of himself working out with troops.

"A sitting president claims that two massive US states are ‘invaded’ territory, sparking a bizarre meltdown from Donald Trump","Colombian President Gustavo Petro dropped a political bombshell recently, claiming that huge parts of the United States, including Texas and California, are actually “invaded territory.” This incredibly aggressive assertion immediately prompted a fiery, personal reaction from President Trump, who publicly warned the Colombian leader that “he better watch his a***.” That is definitely not the kind of reserved, diplomatic language you usually hear, but it shows just how high tensions are running between the two leaders. According to The Hill , President Trump made the comment at Mar-a-Lago just after announcing plans for building new Navy ships. President Trump didn’t mince words about why he was so upset, focusing heavily on drug trafficking and alleged cocaine manufacturing. He stated that Petro has drug factories making cocaine in Colombia and sending it straight into the United States. While the president emphasized that he loves the Colombian people, he called their new leader a “troublemaker.” He issued a direct demand that Petro close up those cocaine factories, claiming, “There are at least three major cocaine factories. We know where they are.” This serious accusation highlights the administration’s apparent frustration with the continuous flow of narcotics Petro specifically said over the weekend that Texas, California, and the entire southern U.S. were invaded, not sold. He made this claim while responding to a question about the U.S. demanding that Venezuela return assets it seized in the past from U.S. oil companies. This entire situation is simmering because Petro and President Trump sit on opposite ends of the political spectrum. Petro is actually the first left-leaning leader Colombia has had in recent history. The Colombian leader believes that the U.S. pressure campaign on Venezuela isn’t about upholding democracy or fighting drug trafficking at all . In an interview last month, Petro stated that oil is at the center of Trump’s logic and his campaign against Venezuela. He said, “So, that’s a negotiation about oil. I believe that is Trump’s logic. He’s not thinking about the democratization of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking.” President Trump lashed out at Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Monday, warning that “he better watch his a‑‑.” https://t.co/SlJmDDyW0s — Border Report (@BorderReportcom) December 23, 2025 It’s clear this conflict has been escalating for a while now. Tensions are already high between the U.S. and Venezuela as oil tankers continue to be seized in the Caribbean. President Trump already hit Petro and his family members with sanctions back in October. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the administration is taking strong action because Petro “has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.” Bessent stated that President Trump is taking this action to protect the nation and make it clear that the U.S. will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into the country.",2025-12-23T19:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/a-sitting-president-claims-that-two-massive-us-states-are-invaded-territory-sparking-a-bizarre-meltdown-from-donald-trump/
‘I don’t want another Afghanistan or Iraq’: These Republic lawmakers just torpadoed Trump’s Venezuela strategy,"Republican lawmakers are seriously divided over President Trump’s aggressive push against Venezuela, as per The Hill . And some senators are actively warning that escalating military pressure to oust President Nicolás Maduro could dangerously backfire on the United States. While the majority of Senate Republicans are on board with President Trump’s strategy of targeting Venezuelan speedboats suspected of drug smuggling, several key figures are expressing concern that striking land targets or putting “boots on the ground” crosses a major red line. This is a big issue because the president himself threatened last month that U.S. strikes against Venezuela could begin “very soon.” One Republican senator, who chose to remain anonymous to speak freely, was crystal clear about the risks. “I do not want to put ground troops in Venezuela. I don’t want to have another Afghanistan or Iraq,” the senator said, adding, “I’m not in favor of U.S.-directed regime change.” This tension highlights a major conflict within the Republican Party Conservatives who align with the America First movement have consistently warned against the United States getting tangled up in endless foreign wars, and yet President Trump’s actions in the Caribbean Sea are starting to look like an expansion of military operations, especially with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth refusing to release full military strike videos . Sen. Rand Paul is one of the most outspoken critics of the administration’s strategy. He believes the administration is pursuing regime change in Venezuela and flatly declared, “I’m opposed to it.” Paul argued that the president is acting arbitrarily by blowing up Venezuelan boats while, earlier this month, pardoning the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández. Hernández was sentenced to 45 years for partnering with cocaine traffickers to move drugs into the US. Republicans divided on whether Trump should topple Venezuela’s Maduro with military force https://t.co/OiIy2bymqb — The Hill (@thehill) December 23, 2025 Paul thinks the administration is bypassing Congress’s constitutional authority to declare war by simply declaring “war against people we designate to be terrorists.” He noted, “Now they’re designating the government terrorists.” Because of these concerns, Paul has teamed up with Senate Democrats to file a war powers resolution. This measure aims to block U.S. armed forces from engaging in hostilities against Venezuela without receiving authorization from Congress. Despite the growing opposition, some administration officials have tried to calm congressional fears. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told senators in a briefing last week that regime change is not their goal in Venezuela . Rubio “said repeatedly that regime change is not the policy of the United States; it was not the focus of the anti-narcotrafficking policy,” according to one senator who attended the briefing. However, those assurances were seriously undercut by comments made by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Wiles told journalist Chris Whipple in an interview that regime change is absolutely President Trump’s goal. “He wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle,” Wiles said. She did suggest that if President Trump wanted to order land strikes, he would need Congress’s authority first.",2025-12-23T19:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/i-dont-want-another-afghanistan-or-iraq-these-republic-lawmakers-just-torpadoed-trumps-venezuela-strategy/
"Fans of this gacha game just raised a staggering amount of money for a run-down farm, all because of one in-game reference","Fans of the popular gacha game and anime series Umamusume: Pretty Derby recently raised a huge amount of money for a struggling horse farm. The Northern Lake Farm, which takes care of the retired racehorse Meisho Doto, started a crowdfunding campaign in October. Their goal was to raise 15 million yen, which is about $95,000 USD, to fix their old and broken stables. But the campaign didn’t just meet that goal. It completely shattered it. When the fundraiser ended, they had raised almost 125 million yen, which is nearly $800,000 USD. That’s over 800% more than what they originally asked for. According to PC Gamer , the entire thing happened because of one horse and his connection to the game. The reason fans donated so much money is because of Meisho Doto himself. He’s a real retired racehorse who inspired one of the “horse girl” characters in the Umamusume series. The farm needed money to fix their damaged horse buildings, but they never actually used Meisho Doto’s name to get more donations. They just wanted to repair their stables. The fanbase took matters into their own hands Fans of the game and anime didn’t need the farm to ask for help. They saw the campaign and started spreading the word on the internet. They used pictures and references to Meisho Doto’s horse girl character from the game to get more people interested. In just two months, they turned a basic repair fund into a massive renovation budget worth eight figures. The dedication shown by this community rivals some of the most surprising incidents people have witnessed online recently. The Northern Lake crowdfunding campaign ultimately raised 125M yen (0.8M USD). The completion of the new stable has also been moved up to March or April, and the day when Meisho Doto and Neko Punch can move out of their rundown house is drawing near. Blessings to all supporters! pic.twitter.com/MeCd0U4PvX — たるまげ (@tarutaru_mage) December 22, 2025 Now that the farm has over 100 million yen, they can do much more than just basic fixes. They plan to buy and install treadmills for the horses. This equipment is important because it helps horses who need extra exercise, or those who can’t move around the pasture easily anymore, stay healthy and active. They’ll also replace all the fencing around the pastures, which is crucial for keeping the horses safe. The huge success of the campaign means the new stable will be finished much sooner than expected. The farm now thinks the stable will be ready by March or April 2025. This means Meisho Doto and his companion Neko Punch can move out of their current run-down home much earlier than planned. The farm was shocked by all the support they received. After the campaign closed on December 22, 2025, the Northern Lake X account posted a thank you message. They said they were grateful for all the generous support and warm messages, and promised to post a proper thank you soon. This fundraiser is part of a bigger trend caused by the Umamusume series. Since the game ended its four-year Japan-only run earlier this year, the real horses that inspired the characters have been getting more attention. Farms are seeing more tourists visiting, and people are donating tons of grass for the retired horses to eat. The passionate response from fans shows how online communities can make a real difference, much like how celebrities use their platforms to support causes they believe in.",2025-12-23T18:45:00+00:00,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/games/fans-of-this-gacha-game-just-raised-a-staggering-amount-of-money-for-a-run-down-farm-all-because-of-one-in-game-reference/
"Valve just pulled the plug on Steam for certain Windows users, and if yours is affected, the clock is already ticking","Valve released an update on December 19 that officially made the Steam Windows client 64-bit only. The company stopped supporting the older 32-bit architecture earlier than it first planned. This change means time is running out for anyone still using the 32-bit version of Windows, even though the client still works for now. According to XDA Developers , this move was not a surprise. Valve announced back in September that it would only support the 64-bit version of Steam starting January 1, 2026. Releasing the final update before that date shows the company is serious about moving to modern architecture. If you are still running a 32-bit version of Windows, you can keep playing your Steam games right now. However, Valve is warning users not to rely on that old client. You should not keep using the 32-bit Steam client because it will stop getting important updates after January 1, 2026. Missing security updates puts your data at serious risk That deadline is very important because your client will not get any new features, security fixes, or bug patches after that date. Running an outdated client that handles purchases, logins, and personal information is dangerous. You will also not be able to get any technical support from Valve once the deadline passes. The company made it clear that the 32-bit Steam Windows client will not work forever and will eventually stop working completely. Steam quietly moves into a new phase on Windows, affecting some older PCs https://t.co/4ZfZ4ETbVl pic.twitter.com/frCTSC6JW9 — XDA (@xdadevelopers) December 22, 2025 If you are using Windows 11, you do not need to worry. Windows 11 only runs on 64-bit, so you are already using the updated Steam client and do not need to do anything. This is not the first time Valve has made controversial decisions that affect their hardware and software ecosystem. However, if you are still using Windows 10, you need to check your system right away. Windows 10 has both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If you are on the 32-bit version, you will have to upgrade to 64-bit if you want to keep getting new features and security fixes on Steam after January 1, 2026. Valve explained why they decided to drop support for the older architecture. They said some of the important system drivers and libraries needed to run core Steam features do not support the 32-bit version of Windows anymore. You cannot build modern, secure features if the basic foundation does not support them. Similar to how Microsoft has quietly changed features on user devices, tech companies are pushing users toward newer systems. The usage numbers also supported this decision. Valve reported that their Steam Hardware Survey showed only 0.01% of systems were still running the 32-bit version of Windows 10. When the user base is that small, it does not make sense to spend resources supporting it. While you can still play your games on your old machine today, you need to switch to 64-bit Windows before January 1, 2026 if you want the most secure Steam experience.",2025-12-23T18:30:00+00:00,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/games/valve-just-pulled-the-plug-on-steam-for-certain-windows-users-and-if-yours-is-affected-the-clock-is-already-ticking/
"Woman suing Miley Cyrus’s parents claims she’s the singer’s biological mom, her story involves celebrities you wouldn’t expect","The woman who says she is Miley Cyrus’s real mother is now speaking out, even though a court already dismissed her lawsuit. Jaymee Lee, who is 45 years old, previously sued Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus for fraud, breach of contract, and interfering with her parental rights. She claimed she was Miley’s biological mom, but Billy Ray has called these claims “absurd.” According to Page Six , Lee shared her story with the press about the allegations she made in the lawsuit. She said she grew up in Ruidoso, New Mexico, where she was sex trafficked by a local gang connected to a cartel when she was very young. Lee claimed she got pregnant at age 12 because of the trafficking. While pregnant, Lee said she tried to run away several times, including going to her grandparents’ house in Jamul, California. She wanted to protect her baby “at all costs.” “I specifically picked the name Miley as soon as I realized I was pregnant because of all the miles I had traveled [while being trafficked]. I wanted a name that was one of a kind that could be linked back to me, specifically,” she claimed. However, Miley’s actual birth name is Destiny Hope. Her story involves several major celebrities Before allegedly connecting with the Cyrus family, Lee claims she asked several famous people to adopt her unborn baby. She reportedly reached out to Julia Roberts, who had a ranch in New Mexico at the time. Lee also allegedly contacted Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne because of their connections to the state, and even Hillary Clinton, who was campaigning in the area. Lee said all the celebrities were kind to her, but none agreed to adopt the baby. Lee then claimed she turned to Dolly Parton, who is now Miley’s godmother. She said Parton connected her to Billy Ray Cyrus, who wanted to adopt a baby. In her dismissed lawsuit, Lee claimed she and Billy Ray agreed to an open adoption where she could be the child’s nanny and piano teacher.

Like other celebrities facing public criticism, the Oasis singer’s recent confrontation shows how stars handle uncomfortable situations. When she decided to sue the Cyruses, Lee claims she asked the Kardashian family for help finding a lawyer. She allegedly met them because they owned property next to her grandparents in Jamul. However, there is no record that the Kardashians ever owned property there. Celebrity interactions often make headlines, much like what a former prime minister said about Trudeau’s partner at a recent event. A woman (Jamie Lee) filed a lawsuit alleging she had recovered a memory of giving birth to Miley Cyrus at age 12, claiming she made a private adoption agreement with Billy Ray and Tish that was not honored (like being able to be around Miley) The court dismissed her crazy case. pic.twitter.com/ECw4J7Oiu1 — Miley Official (@MileyCyrusBz) December 10, 2025 Lee said she only recently remembered her trauma after moving back to Ruidoso triggered flashbacks. She checked herself into an Arizona mental health facility in 2016 and was diagnosed with PTSD. A doctor told her the brain can block out severe trauma, which is how she allegedly remembered being raped and having a baby. After allegedly remembering, Lee claims she reached out to Miley through lawyers but got no response. She also tried to report the trafficking to police but claims nobody took it seriously. Lee admits her story “does seem weird” but insists “the truth is crazy sometimes.” Despite a court already denying her request for a DNA test, Lee plans to file a new case in Malibu, California, where Miley lives, to seek a DNA test. Billy Ray was recently awarded $7,564.13 in legal fees, which Lee was ordered to pay last week.",2025-12-22T23:45:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/entertainment/woman-suing-miley-cyruss-parents-claims-shes-the-singers-biological-mom-her-story-involves-celebrities-you-wouldnt-expect/
"Xbox players are reportedly losing access to decades of games overnight, and it’s not always their fault","Some Xbox users are losing access to their entire game libraries and linked Microsoft services like OneDrive and cloud storage. The worst part is that many of these players didn’t do anything wrong. When you buy a digital game, you don’t actually own it, and now players are seeing the real consequences of that. The impact of this problem is severe. According to Gaming Bible , industry insider Jez Corden has been investigating these reports for almost a year. He found that when Xbox bans an account for any reason, even by mistake or due to a technical error, the damage goes way beyond just losing gaming access. Players lose their entire Xbox account, which means decades of photos stored in OneDrive and important Office documents disappear too. Getting anything back from Microsoft after this happens is extremely rare. This is devastating for people who have trusted Microsoft’s system for years. Players are losing decades of gaming history and personal data Many Xbox accounts have been active since the Xbox 360 era. Players have built up hundreds of games and years of GamerScore and achievements. Losing all of that overnight is a nightmare scenario that’s actually happening to real people right now. You don’t even need to break any rules for this to happen. Account hacking is still very common in 2025. One player on X said they had their Microsoft account since Xbox 360 and spent thousands of dollars on games. After a hacker took over their account and changed the email, Microsoft told them they couldn’t recover it. Fifteen years of progress was gone forever. These shocking discoveries about tech companies continue to worry consumers about their digital safety. I've been investigating these reports for almost a year now. When you get banned on Xbox for whatever reason (even if it's not your fault), you can lose not only your Xbox account, but also decades of photos from OneDrive, Office docs, etc. It's rare to get anything back. https://t.co/kXXp0mWLrA — Jez (@JezCorden) December 19, 2025 This shows the main problem with giving up physical game discs. Digital purchases are convenient, but they’re not truly yours. Nobody can take a physical game disc from your shelf, but a technical error or wrong ban can erase your digital library instantly. Microsoft has been making other controversial moves lately, including quietly adding features to smart TVs without user consent. Users were shocked when they heard about this issue. The community reaction shows how worried people are about digital ownership. “yeah sorry but thats why i only buy physical on consoles since i think early last year. I realized its kind of stupid to buy many or expensive games that are locked to an account. For digital gog is actually amazing, very underrated more people should use it,” one user wrote.

"Sony just filed a patent to make every game family-friendly, and the bizarre AI technology it uses to replace slurs is absolutely wild","Sony just patented an incredibly ambitious AI censorship tool that could theoretically make every single video game, even the most adult AAA titles, completely family-friendly, as per GamingBible . Sony Interactive Entertainment filed the patent on December 9, and it reveals a powerful processor that can detect and access a game’s audio and video content. The goal is simple: to keep up with the evolving gaming tech landscape and use AI to provide tailored censorship for different users. While this technology is aimed squarely at the PlayStation 5 and upcoming PlayStation 6, the documents suggest Sony sees this being used across all major computer ecosystems. That means we could potentially see this kind of filtering on rival consoles, including Microsoft’s Xbox and even the Nintendo Switch hardware. This isn’t just about muting the occasional bad word. The AI system is designed to handle everything from blurring nudity and gore to completely muting slurs. What’s truly next-level, though, is the use of deepfake AI technology. Instead of just hiding content, the system can actually replace the censored audio or video, meaning you would hear or see something altogether different than what the original game intended. I think it’s a unique use of AI, even if generative AI has faced some serious criticism lately . This patent is clearly Sony’s way of ensuring every game is accessible to all ages The official patent description lays out the technical vision: “Artificial intelligence (AI) models are disclosed to customize audio video (AV) content, such as video game content, based on user-provided content filtering parameters.” This tool is designed to be fully automated and incredibly flexible. The system would implement a second processor specifically to obscure or replace the selected content based on your user profile. The flexibility is key here because users are able to set their own parameters at will. Upcoming major AAA releases could offer users the choice to filter out things like adult language, nudity, gore, alcohol use, and scenes of a sexual nature. If you’re a content creator or streamer, this could be massive. Having a built-in tool that automatically cleans up a game means you won’t have to worry about accidentally violating platform rules mid-stream. It also makes games viable for younger players. Sony Launches AI Censorship Tool, PS5, Xbox and Nintendo Consoles Targeted https://t.co/LiX28cOlh0 — GAMINGbible (@gamingbible) December 19, 2025 The AI will keep you informed, too. The patent reveals that players will be notified of upcoming content both before the game starts and while it is running. While this is happening, the AI will carry out the censorship based on your specific preferences. You then get to choose whether you want the AI to “remove the content” or simply “replace the content.” It’s genuinely hard to wrap my head around how this would work for a game that leans heavily into adult themes, like the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI . Trying to imagine a fully censored GTA is a challenge, but the fact that Sony is investing in this technology shows they are serious about creating highly customized player experiences. This newly acquired patent could radically change how we play games and what we see in them.",2025-12-22T23:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/gaming/sony-just-filed-a-patent-to-make-every-game-family-friendly-and-the-bizarre-ai-technology-it-uses-to-replace-slurs-is-absolutely-wild/
"AI just cost ‘Clair Obscur’ its GOTY award, and the game that replaced it might have the same problem","The RPG game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has lost its two major awards after the Indie Game Awards found out the game used AI during development. The studio behind the game, Sandfall Interactive, had won both Game of the Year and Best Debut Game on December 18, but those wins have now been taken away. The IGA posted a video on Bluesky yesterday announcing that the game is now disqualified. This is a big problem for both the game’s reputation and the awards process. The main issue is that the IGA has a strict policy against generative AI. According to PC Gamer , Mike Towndrow from the IGA nomination committee said the organization talks about this throughout the year when looking at possible nominees and does not allow any games that use generative AI. However, the game that replaced Clair Obscur has also been accused of using AI. The developers gave conflicting statements about AI use What makes this situation worse is that the developers seemed to change their story. Towndrow said that Sandfall Interactive had originally agreed that no generative AI was used when they submitted the game. But on the day of the awards premiere, the studio admitted that generative AI was actually used in making the game. The timing of this admission was shocking. This is not the first time people questioned the game’s content. Just days after Clair Obscur came out in April, fans noticed textures that looked like they were made by AI. The developer quietly removed those textures and called them a placeholder texture in a patch note. AI technology has been rapidly advancing across different industries, with companies racing to integrate new AI capabilities into their products.

The controversy grew more intense, however, when it was claimed that Blue Prince also used AI in its production.

"Bill Clinton’s spokesperson claims ‘We’re in the first’ group who cut Epstein off, but the hot tub photo just blasted that denial to pieces","A spokesperson for the Justice Department just dropped a massive piece of news, claiming that the blacked-out person next to Bill Clinton in one of those widely circulated hot tub photos is actually a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse, as per CNN . This development immediately complicates the narrative coming from the former president’s team. Gates McGavick, the Justice Department spokesperson, confirmed the status of the redacted individual. McGavick posted the image directly to X, explaining that the black box was added specifically to protect a victim. McGavick wrote that the photo showed a “Beloved Democrat President,” adding, “The black box is added to protect a victim.” The identification of a victim in the photo directly conflicts with the defense put out by Clinton’s spokesperson, Angel Ureña. Ureña had released a statement earlier claiming that the former president not only did not know about Epstein’s horrific crimes but had also cut off his relationship with the convicted sex offender before those crimes even came to light. The former president is seemingly in hot water Ureña tried to draw a clear line in the sand regarding those who associated with Epstein. “There are two types of people here,” Ureña said. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.” If the person in the hot tub photo is indeed a victim, that statement looks incredibly shaky right now. The Justice Department is required to redact information that could identify victims who were sexually abused , thanks to the Epstein Files Transparency Act. This is why you see the black boxes in the first place. You should know, though, that it is not clear that every single redaction in every photo was made to protect a confirmed victim; for instance, an older man’s face was blacked out in some of the images. Despite this shocking new context surrounding the photo, it is crucial to remember that Clinton has never been accused of any wrongdoing by law enforcement, nor has he been charged with any crimes related to Epstein. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche supported this fact in a letter sent to Congress. Blanche stated that the Justice Department had conducted an extensive review of all the Epstein-related materials. Nearly naked Bill Clinton pictured soaking in hot tub with unidentified woman in Epstein files: ‘His reckoning.’ Read today's cover here: https://t.co/XqAHwTVION pic.twitter.com/lOVPuSa7tZ — New York Post (@nypost) December 20, 2025 That review, Blanche confirmed, did not “uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,” which would include Clinton. This means the DOJ hasn’t found anything in the just-released Epstein Files, which also has a picture of Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein , that would warrant opening an investigation into the former president. The Clinton spokesperson immediately fired back at the current administration following the photo’s circulation. The statement claimed that the Trump administration was “shielding themselves from what comes next.” It is important to note the political context surrounding the spokesperson who posted the image. Before Gates McGavick joined President Trump’s administration this year, he worked for the Republican National Committee and several Republican lawmakers. When other outlets asked the Justice Department specifically about McGavick’s post on X, the Department declined to provide any comment. This leaves us with a high-profile claim from a politically affiliated spokesperson that seems to undermine the former president’s defense, but without official confirmation from the wider DOJ.",2025-12-22T23:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/bill-clintons-spokesperson-claims-were-in-the-first-group-who-cut-epstein-off-but-the-hot-tub-photo-just-blasted-that-denial-to-pieces/
"Careful! Some card readers are trying to scam people, and this Walmart shopper almost paid $90 than needed at checkout","A Walmart shopper has gone viral after posting a warning to others about a shocking price jump that nearly added $90 to her bill at checkout. The incident highlights why shoppers should always double-check the total on the payment screen, especially when using self-checkout lanes during busy shopping hours. According to Daily Dot , the shopper, who goes by the username @nobrasallowed on TikTok , shared the experience from a recent trip to Walmart. According to her video, everything seemed normal at first. After scanning her items, the self-checkout screen showed a total of $108, which matched what she expected to pay. However, things changed the moment she inserted her card to complete the purchase. Instead of the $108 total, the card reader suddenly displayed a charge of $193. Realizing something was wrong, she quickly removed her card before the payment could go through. This suspicious pricing error raises serious questions about checkout accuracy She then called over a Walmart employee for help. The worker moved the transaction to a different register and re-rang the items. This time, the total correctly came out to $108, confirming that the higher amount was an error. The shopper said the issue was resolved, but she shared the video to warn others to stay alert and never assume the checkout total is correct without checking it carefully. The shopper didn’t complete the $193 payment, so she’s not sure if the machine would have charged her the extra $90. Still, she thought the error was very strange and wanted to warn other shoppers. She told people to be careful and pay extra attention when shopping. @nobrasallowed Walmart felt a little fishy today. Maybe just a glitch. Be on the lookout and take extra care! #walmart #shopping #groceries #priceincrease ♬ original sound – nobrasallowed She said it perfectly when she wondered, “I wonder how many people paid extra without noticing.” You shouldn’t have to check a big retailer’s computer systems just to buy groceries safely. This isn’t the first time Walmart shoppers have raised concerns about store practices . Many people responded to her post and said they’ve seen similar problems. Some shoppers shared other checkout errors they’ve noticed and worried about how many mistakes they might have missed over time. Another shopper described a weird problem they saw twice in one week. After scanning an item, the system automatically added the next size up of that product along with the one they actually scanned. This meant they were charged for two items when they only picked up one. They said the receipt showed an employee had to manually remove the extra item, and they believed it felt intentional.

"SF blackout turns into total chaos as Waymo self-driving cars stall mid-intersection, what the company has to say about it is more bizarre","San Francisco was plunged into darkness over the weekend due to a massive power outage, but the real drama started when the city’s fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis went totally haywire. The citywide outage forced the autonomous ride-hailing service to halt operations immediately, leaving vehicles stranded right in the middle of streets and busy intersections, as reported by TMZ . This is a nightmare scenario for AVs, and it immediately sparked public concern about how these vehicles handle infrastructure failures. Pedestrians caught the whole thing on video, showing just how bad the gridlock got. In the busy North Beach neighborhood, at least four Waymo vehicles were seen parked dead center in a major intersection. They had their hazards flashing, but they were causing a massive traffic jam that brought human drivers to a standstill. The company had to shut down the system around 8:00 PM. The reason for the shutdown is pretty critical: the cars simply can’t operate safely when there aren’t functioning traffic signals. If the car relies entirely on external signals to know when to move, any widespread power failure means the car becomes a very expensive, very immobile roadblock. It’s another public embarrassment for Waymo As the chaos unfolded, a Waymo spokesperson confirmed that ride-hailing services were “temporarily suspended” because of the outage. The company stated their teams were working “diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability,” adding that they hoped to get services back online soon. The power problems weren’t fixed quickly, either. Thousands of San Franciscans were still without electricity on Sunday morning as utility crews worked to restore power after the nearly day-long outage. After the initial confusion subsided, Waymo confirmed that they were resuming ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area. This is where the company’s follow-up statement gets particularly interesting, because it sounds like they’re trying to shift the focus away from the fact that their cars stalled completely. Zombie apocalypse Waymo Cars extremely Dangerously Halted ALL traffic During San Francisco Power Outage https://t.co/XAeUMZ2XXG — GNews ( Vegan ) (@GNews_Vegan) December 22, 2025 A spokesperson acknowledged that the power outage was a “widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions.” They admitted that the failure of utility infrastructure was significant. However, the spokesperson then pivoted to focus on their own technology’s future capabilities, claiming the company is “committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.” I think that statement is a little bizarre. If the cars had adjusted to traffic flow, they wouldn’t have stalled and blocked intersections in the first place. While that’s arguably better than driving through an active police standoff , stalling in the middle of a busy street is the opposite of adjusting to traffic flow. If a major city loses all its traffic signals, you need autonomous vehicles that can safely pull over to the side of the road or navigate based on human-like decision-making. This incident highlights a major vulnerability in self-driving tech. If a car becomes a hazard the moment basic city infrastructure fails, or drives past school buses that have their stop arms extended , that’s a huge problem for widespread adoption. Waymo finished its statement by saying they are “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.” If they truly want to maintain that trust, they’re going to have to prove that their next generation of software can handle a total blackout without turning into a total mess.",2025-12-22T22:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/auto/sf-blackout-turns-into-total-chaos-as-waymo-self-driving-cars-stall-mid-intersection-what-the-company-has-to-say-about-it-is-more-bizarre/

The actor shut down a question about whether the spy would enjoy Christmas with a strong refusal. Brosnan played 007 in four movies and was answering questions when a journalist asked if Bond would celebrate the holidays. According to Entertainment Weekly , Brosnan quickly replied that Bond would obviously enjoy Christmas. But when the interviewer asked if Bond’s tough personality would make him skip the holidays, Brosnan stopped the conversation. He said he didn’t want to answer and wouldn’t answer the question.

He mentioned that Sean Connery, who played Bond before him, felt the same way after leaving the role. Brosnan remembered Connery’s reaction was to tell people to never ask about it again. It seems this frustration comes with the job once you stop playing Bond. Instead of discussing Bond’s plans, Brosnan talked about his own Christmas.

"‘I’m a bad, bad daddy!’: This bizarre bear owner keeps his massive pet from hibernating using one ridiculous trick","Bear owner Jeff “the Bear Man” Watson has revealed his ridiculous secret for keeping his massive pets from hibernating during the winter months. While most animals that sleep through the cold season do so out of necessity, Watson, who has gained over 4.4 million views on TikTok, claims his brown and black bears simply do not need the long nap. You might be wondering how he convinces a giant bear to stay awake when the weather gets chilly. His joking answer is truly priceless. “I’ll tell you why,” Watson said in his video , which TikTok won’t let us show here, but you can see it on TikTok if you follow the link. “’Cause I look at him and go, ‘You can’t go to sleep! You cannot hibernate! ‘Cause I’m a bad, bad daddy!’” While that’s a hilarious image, the actual mechanism is much simpler, and it completely changes how we think about bears. Watson explains that in the wild, brown and black bears in North America are primarily vegetarian animals. When winter hits, their natural food sources like berries, nuts, and grasses disappear, which is what forces them to go into hibernation. They slow their heart rate and respiration down, living off the fat reserves they built up during the warmer months until spring arrives. This sounds like a wild claim, but the science actually backs him up Since Watson provides his bears with abundant food all year round, they never hit that crisis point where their food supply vanishes. He notes that the bears simply do not have a biological need to go to sleep. “He’s got a bear daddy who gives him his food,” Watson concluded. “It’s not necessary if food’s available.” And the whole thing is backed by science, and it’s not outlandish like the story of the Cocaine Bear . It’s easy to think of bears as terrifying, meat-eating predators, but they are technically omnivores whose diets skew heavily toward vegetarianism. They consume a huge variety of seeds, fruits, roots, and grass when available. They will certainly eat small mammals or fish if they can, but their main calorie sources come from plants. This means that if you keep those plant-based calories coming, you can expect the bears to stay active. This behavior even occurs in the wild when the conditions are right. For instance, places with warmer climates sometimes see bears skip hibernation altogether, or they might only sleep for a much shorter period than bears in freezing environments. Commenters on Watson’s video pointed this out, citing that bears in North Carolina sometimes only hibernate for about a month because the climate is too warm. Other users mentioned Kodiak Island, where the bears often skip hibernation because their food is plentiful year-round. Of course, for many viewers, the science was secondary to the sheer shock of the situation. While some states allow people to keep bears with a permit, it is certainly an unorthodox choice. Many users ignored the discussion of hibernation entirely and instead focused on the bizarre reality of having a massive brown bear as a pet. “Other people out here just living my dreams,” one commenter wrote. Another joked, “I KNEW they could be pet, I KNEW it.” It’s definitely a strange situation, but if you’re going to keep a bear, it’s nice to know you can keep the fun going without waiting for them to wake up in the spring. The same goes for pet turtles, especially if you are one of those forcing them into brumation .",2025-12-22T22:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/im-a-bad-bad-daddy-this-bizarre-bear-owner-keeps-his-massive-pet-from-hibernating-using-one-ridiculous-trick/
"A fan spotted a former Nickelodeon actor on the streets and started recording, now the internet is divided on what happened next","Tylor Chase, who played Martin Qwerly on Nickelodeon’s Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide , was recently seen living homeless on the streets of Riverside, California. A video showing the 36-year-old actor went viral back in September, leaving fans shocked and concerned. In the clip, Chase looked extremely disheveled when a fan approached him with a camera. The person filming mistakenly asked if he was on Disney Channel, but Chase corrected them and said he was on Nickelodeon. He confirmed his role on Ned’s Declassified , which aired from 2004 to 2007. After the video spread online, fans immediately tried to help by launching a GoFundMe page. The fundraiser raised over $1,200, but it was shut down almost right away by Chase’s mother. His mother revealed that Tylor desperately needs medical attention, but he refuses to accept it. She explained that giving him money wouldn’t actually help his situation. According to her, Chase can’t manage money for his medications by himself, and he loses phones within a day or two of receiving them. Chase’s mother explains why he needs medical help, not money The viral footage caused a major split among viewers online. Many fans expressed sadness, with some calling the Hollywood industry “sick” for letting this happen. However, others criticized the person who filmed Chase during such a difficult moment in his life. This isn’t the first time California has seen viral moments involving public incidents, like when a Waymo robotaxi experienced a meltdown . One viewer on X wrote, “Hey, so instead of filming him for a video, maybe ask how you can help him or just do anything other than this.” “The help might come from someone watching this video. How many people would know if this video was not circulating? This might be the best thing she can do so that he can receive the attention he needs,” another argued.

Daniel Curtis Lee, Lindsey Shaw, and Devon Werkheiser discussed the video on the September 24 episode of their Ned’s Declassified Podcast Survival Guide . Lee, 34, said his first reaction was anger, wondering why someone would put a camera in Chase’s face during hard times. Shaw, who has been open about her own past struggles with drug addiction, shared that she’s been in similar situations before. The three co-stars promised to help Chase in any way they can, though Lee confirmed that the former Martin actor won’t be appearing on the podcast anytime soon.

Woman orders steak at Capital Grille and the server decides she belongs at the kids’ table after hearing one shocking request,"A woman attending her company’s annual holiday luncheon at Capital Grille in North Raleigh, N.C., got an unexpected surprise when her server joked about her order by bringing her a Disney Frozen coloring book, according to BroBible . That’s right, Danielle Boncella, who shared the story on her TikTok account @daniellaboncella, sparked a massive online debate about steak etiquette after she asked for a side of ketchup with her medium-well steak. Boncella recounted the whole awkward situation in a video that has already racked up more than 8,000 views. She’s pretty clear about her culinary preferences, even if they aren’t exactly traditional fine dining fare. “One thing about me, your girl loves a steak,” she said, adding that she likes it medium-well and “dipped in ketchup,” too. When she placed the order at the upscale restaurant, her request for ketchup immediately drew laughter from both her co-workers and the waitstaff. She recalled the server making fun of her, rolling her eyes as she said he suggested she “should probably sit at the kids’ table.” The joke didn’t end there, though, and what happened next was truly hilarious The server came back a little bit later and presented her with a plastic-wrapped, Frozen -themed coloring book. Boncella was laughing in disbelief as she held it up, explaining that he told her she needed the book for the kids’ table in case she got bored and wanted to color. I’m not going to lie, ordering ketchup for a steak at a nice spot like Capital Grille is definitely controversial, and you can see why the server reacted the way he did. Despite the teasing and the coloring book delivery, Boncella took the joke incredibly well. She insisted in the video caption that she’s just “a little kid trapped inside a 31 yr old body.” She also later confirmed that she wasn’t offended at all, calling the whole ordeal the “best dining experience” she’d had “in a long time.” Of course, it is much better than some snooping Michelin-starred restaurants for sure. She loved the entertainment, even if she was “the butt of the joke.” @daniellaboncella I promise I’m just a little kid trapped inside a 31 yr old body. If you’re ever in North Raleigh, Capital Grille is a must #raleigh #northcarolina #storytime #imjustagirl #singlemom ♬ original sound – Danielle Viewers were totally divided on whether the server went too far with his playful jabs. Many people defended Boncella’s right to eat her food exactly how she likes it, and I agree with them. It’s your steak, after all. One commenter wrote that people need to mind their own business, adding, “it’s your steak, they’re not eating it haha furthermore who doesn’t use ketchup lol.” Another user championed her preferences, saying, “Stand firm for what you want. You have every right. Nobody should be judging you.” Other viewers praised the server’s cleverness and Boncella’s good sense of humor. One person loved the commitment to the bit, writing, “I love this!! Color pack brought out to complete the joke. My kind of people.” Just like how the internet reacted to Joe Jonas’ reaction to his own public grilling , a commenter was glad Boncella wasn’t uptight, saying, “Glad to see you have a sense of humor. Most folks are so uptight these days.” Boncella made it clear that she didn’t mind the joke one bit, and she stressed that if you’re ever in North Raleigh, “Capital Grille is a must.”",2025-12-22T21:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/woman-orders-steak-at-capital-grille-and-the-server-decides-she-belongs-at-the-kids-table-after-hearing-one-shocking-request/
"Santa and his elves just made the naughty list, as camera catches them filling carts at Montreal grocery store, but they weren’t shopping","A group of people dressed as Santa and masked elves were caught on camera filling up several grocery carts at a Montreal store on Monday night. They left the building without paying for any of the food. Montreal police are now investigating the incident as a shoplifting case. According to the CBC , the event happened around 9:15 PM on Monday on Laurier Avenue, near Chambord Street. Police spokesperson Caroline Chèvrefils confirmed that several masked and disguised people were involved. They left the store with the stolen food. An activist group called Robins des ruelles, which means Robins of the Alleys, took responsibility for the theft on social media. The group called it a “great food drive” and a political protest. They said the stolen food was worth about $3,000. The group defended their actions with a controversial statement The activists explained why they stole the food. They said supermarket chains are using inflation as an excuse to raise prices while making record profits. Meanwhile, regular people are struggling to afford basic groceries. A statement on their Instagram page was direct about their message. “A handful of corporations are holding our basic needs hostage,” it said. “For us, that’s theft, and they are the real criminals.” The group didn’t keep the stolen food for themselves. They gave it away under a Christmas tree at place Valois in Montreal’s Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve area. Any leftover food went to community fridges around the city. This kind of vigilante action isn’t new, as we’ve seen people step in to stop criminals in unexpected ways before. Report: A group of people 40 individuals dressed as Santas and masked elves robbed a Metro grocery store in Montreal’s Plateau-Mont-Royal neighborhood to protest rising food costs. They filled carts and bags with roughly $3,000 worth of groceries before leaving without paying. pic.twitter.com/eop2g8Zqzf — The Calvin Coolidge Project (@TheCalvinCooli1) December 22, 2025 The timing of this protest makes sense when you look at recent food price data. Statistics Canada’s Consumer Price Index for November showed that grocery inflation reached its highest rate in almost two years. While overall inflation was 2.2 percent, food prices jumped 4.7 percent compared to last year. Food costs have been rising faster than general inflation since August 2024. Public reaction on social media has been mostly positive, showing how frustrated people are with high grocery prices. However, Metro, the store that was robbed, strongly condemned the stunt. Spokesperson Geneviève Grégoire said theft is always unacceptable and is a criminal act, no matter the reason. Public safety concerns remain important, just like when strangers send warning signals to protect each other. Marc-André Cyr, a political science lecturer at Université du Québec à Montréal, noted the huge gap between institutions calling this a crime and the public seeing it as acceptable. He believes this action works because it forces people to talk about poverty, inflation, and grocery store profits. Police are reviewing videos of the incident, but no arrests have been made yet.",2025-12-22T21:15:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/true-crime/santa-and-his-elves-just-made-the-naughty-list-as-camera-catches-them-filling-carts-at-montreal-grocery-store-but-they-werent-shopping/
"VP Vance takes a bizarre dig at Jasmine Crockett’s nails and ‘street girl persona,’ but her brutal clapback instantly destroys him","Representative Jasmine Crockett absolutely demolished Vice President Vance after he took a bizarre and personal dig at her “street girl persona” and her appearance, as per The Hill . Vance launched the insult during a speech at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, prompting a brutal clapback from the Texas Democrat that instantly shifted the conversation to the most sensitive topic in Republican politics. Vance specifically targeted Crockett while rattling off a list of Democratic candidates he seemed to deem unimpressive. After receiving boos from the audience simply by mentioning her name, the vice president doubled down on the personal attack. “And Jasmine Crockett. Oh, Jasmine Crockett,” Vance said. “The record speaks for itself. She wants to be a senator, though her street girl persona is about as real as her nails.” Honestly, Vance walked right into this one, giving Crockett the perfect opening for a political counterpunch. She didn’t wait long, posting a response on X that immediately referenced President Trump’s high-pressure campaign against his first-term vice president, Mike Pence, following the 2020 election. Crockett reminded everyone that Vance secured his current position because his boss incited a violent mob to target his predecessor She directly questioned Vance’s priorities, focusing on the dark events of January 6, 2021, “Imagine commenting on someone’s nails while at the same time ignoring that the only reason you got your political ‘dream’ job was because your boss incited a violent mob who wanted to hang your predecessor for, oh I don’t know, honoring his oath to the Constitution?!” She was referring to the mob of President Trump supporters who famously erected a gallows and chanted “Hang Mike Pence” outside the Capitol. Crockett, who recently launched her own Senate bid in Texas, didn’t stop there. She urged Vance to focus on real issues instead of her nails. She challenged him to save the political mudslinging for the Senate floor, demanding that he work to stop his boss from “bankrupting our country while engaging in the largest corruption scheme we’ve ever seen?!” JUST IN: Jasmine Crockett is fuming over VP Vance saying that she has a ""street-girl persona.""

His overall message was urging conservatives to unite against the left rather than getting distracted by internal party feuds, even calling out Nick Fuentes for his wild statement against his wife, Usha Vance . Crockett’s entry into the Texas Senate race has actually been welcomed by the Republicans locked in their own fierce primary battle, which is an interesting wrinkle in the story. She is currently leading the Democratic primary field, according to a poll released last week, holding an 8 percentage point lead over state Representative James Talarico. The Texas representative has also made it clear that she is willing to cross party lines to gain support, announcing last week that voters in the red state who regret voting for President Trump are welcome to join her campaign. It seems like her no-holds-barred attitude isn’t just for viral clapbacks; it’s a key part of her campaign strategy.",2025-12-22T21:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/vp-vance-takes-a-bizarre-dig-at-jasmine-crocketts-nails-and-street-girl-persona-but-her-brutal-clapback-instantly-destroys-him/
‘My worst nightmare’: Mother speaks out after two teens allegedly killed her 14-year-old daughter in a crime so brutal they’re being tried as adults,"Two Florida boys will be tried as adults for killing 14-year-old Danika Troy. The boys, 16-year-old Gabriel Williams and 14-year-old Kimahri Blevins, are accused of shooting her multiple times and setting her body on fire. The murder happened near Pensacola in Pace, Florida, on November 30. According to the NY Post , the State Attorney’s Office announced on Friday that both teens were indicted on first-degree premeditated murder charges. Police say the boys lured Troy to a walking path where they shot her and then burned her body. Troy’s mother reported her missing the next morning, and someone found her badly burned remains on December 2 around 11:00 AM. The victim was identified only by her shoes and electric scooter, which she had ridden to meet the boys. The Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office arrested both suspects within days. They were first held at a juvenile detention center but were moved to the Santa Rosa County Jail without bond after the indictment. The motive behind this crime remains a complete mystery to investigators Sheriff Bob Johnson said the evidence pointed to the boys right away, which led to their quick arrest. He expressed shock at the violence, saying it’s bad enough to kill a 14-year-old, but shooting her multiple times and then setting her on fire is even worse. Police believe the attack was planned after the three teens had a disagreement on social media in November. Troy had allegedly called Williams worthless and a gang member. However, the sheriff said the motive they received “doesn’t fit the forensics or any facts of the case.” UPDATE: Florida “teens” accused of luring a 14-year-old girl into the woods before k*lling her and setting her body on fire will be tried as adults Gabriel Williams, 16, and Kimahri Blevins, 14, allegedly plotted to k*ll Danika Troy after one of them said his “feelings were… pic.twitter.com/Eumq51Lxpc — Unlimited L's (@unlimited_ls) December 22, 2025 This suggests there’s more to the story that hasn’t been discovered yet. Similar to another shocking case where authorities launched investigations , this tragedy has left many questions unanswered. Danika’s mother, Ashley Troy, revealed that her daughter had been friends with the boys before the online fight. One of them allegedly pretended to have romantic feelings for Danika to trick her into meeting them. Ashley told reporters that Williams pretended to have feelings for her daughter, which is how she was lured to the walking path.

It’s nothing I ever imagined. My worst nightmare.” Like a woman who discovered painful truths in her late mother’s belongings, Ashley is left searching for closure. She has chosen not to blame the boys directly and instead blames evil influence for the killing. The boys allegedly used a gun stolen from Williams’ mother.

"The Justice Department’s embarrassing cover-up of Donald Trump’s Epstein photo crumbles, forcing them to restore the chilling image","The US Justice Department has restored an image it removed just a day earlier from the public release of investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein, as per The Guardian . This specific photo, which included a picture of President Donald Trump, was initially flagged for potentially exposing victims of the late convicted sex offender. The department stated on X that after a review, it determined there was “no evidence” that any Epstein victims were depicted in the photograph, so it is back up without any changes or redactions. The image in question was a photograph of Epstein’s desk in his New York mansion, which featured two photographs of President Trump visible on the surface. This whole unexplained removal immediately triggered accusations from Democrats about clear political interference favoring the president, who was a former friend of Epstein. Democrats on the House Oversight committee were quick to respond, posting on X that this photo, file 468, had been removed from the DOJ release. They demanded transparency, later calling the incident a “White House cover-up.” That honestly looked like a cover-up Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche jumped into the fray, insisting that the removal of images, including the one of President Trump, had “nothing to do” with the president. Blanche maintained that the 16 removals happened because victim advocacy groups requested them. He told stated that the department had pulled the images down to investigate because they “don’t have perfect information.” He promised the images “will go back up,” with the only question being whether they needed redactions. However, it seems the real issue might be under-redaction, not just the single image of President Trump. Victims’ rights advocate Gloria Allred told CNN that the “system has failed the survivors.” She saw a number of survivors’ names that should never have been published, noting that the whole point of the process is to protect survivors. Allred also expressed concern about images of potential victims that were not redacted, including some that “may be of women unclothed.” Items from the Epstein files, including a photo containing Donald Trump, were removed by the justice department on Saturday On Sunday, they were reinstated Read why: https://t.co/Tmghg9z3O7 — Lorenza (@lorenza71319) December 22, 2025 One victim actually wrote a redacted letter posted to X detailing the extraordinary contradiction they faced. This victim had reported Epstein to the FBI back in 2009, but they had never been allowed to view their own FBI file. Now, their identity was publicly released in the mass document dump. They wrote that the contradiction is “extraordinary,” since the DOJ asserts their file requires “prolonged review,” yet had no difficulty publicly releasing their identity. The Justice Department’s handling of the files has led to broader criticism about the inadequacy of the overall release. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the initial document release “inadequate” and said it “falls short of what the law requires.” He argued that legal statutes require the Justice Department to give Congress and the American people a written explanation within 15 days as to why documents are withheld. Democrats are claiming the files released so far have been heavily redacted and selected specifically to paint Democrats, like former President Bill Clinton, in a bad light. Pictures of Clinton luxuriating in a hot tub with Ghislaine Maxwell were included in the release, putting him right back in the middle of the scandal. Earlier, Mark Epstein attempted to clarify a leaked old email that talked about photos of Donald Trump “blowing Bubba.”",2025-12-22T20:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/the-justice-departments-embarrassing-cover-up-of-donald-trumps-epstein-photo-crumbles-forcing-them-to-restore-the-chilling-image/
Forza Horizon 6 Car Wishlist: The Vehicles We Want,"Let’s be real — going into 2026, the majority of the audience is hyped for just two upcoming bangers: Grand Theft Auto VI and Forza Horizon 6. This is because both are released once in a generation, capable of reshaping the entire gaming industry. While GTA VI caters to a different crowd, Forza Horizon 6 is for us — people who live for the sports and car culture. Today, the spotlight is on the major selling point of this franchise: the never-ending car list. No doubt that the next entry will feature absolute fan favorites; however, there are some must-adds that we can’t wait to floor across the stunning Japanese highways. So, without further ado, here’s our Forza Horizon 6 car wishlist. Forza Horizon 6 Car Wishlist The Holy Grails Image: Playground Games These automotive legends have been sitting in the community’s wishlist for quite a while now. Forza Horizon 6 is set in Japan, and the timeless aura that these cars have is only going to make them shine brighter in a Tokyo-like atmosphere. Here’s what we want in the next entry. Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren : Arguably the most requested car, this unicorn has been missing from the franchise for years. Hopefully, the licensing issues are resolved so fans can finally get a chance to drive it, once again. Bugatti Bolide: The Divo and Chiron have been the go-to speedtrap-breakers for many. However, getting behind the wheel of a track-focused Bugatti Bolide would be a treat for the enthusiasts. Ferrari Daytona SP3 : This monster came out in 2022, but still failed to appear in Forza Horizon 5. But in the Japanese urban setting, the cyberpunk-ish Daytona SP3 is only going to make the scene prettier. Toyota GR GT: This car is all over the car community. With a promising reveal and a planned 2027 global release, we expect it later in the game. Gazoo Racing (GR) is known for its automotive wonders, which makes the twin-turbo V8 Toyota GR GT a worthy candidate for the new Horizon car roster. The JDM Legends Image: Playground Games While Forza Horizon 5 featured loads of JDM legends , we have high hopes for its successor. As the game is now based in Japan, from Kei cars to icons, we want everything. The following JDM vehicles made it to our wishlist. Lexus IS300/ Toyota Altezza: We’ve got the LFA, SC300, and even the MK4, but the Altezza, a.k.a the JDM version of the IS 300, remains absent from the Horizon franchise. Hope it’s featured in the next game so enthusiasts can have a fun, 4-door Japanese legend to drift with. Toyota Century (V12): There’s no better game than Forza Horizon 6 to add the glorious Toyota Century V12. The car is a symbol of authority and was used by Japan’s CEOs and even the Prime Ministers at some point. We can’t wait for it to make an appearance. Suzuki Alto Works: Kei cars are the most significant part of the Japanese car culture. While the game is set to feature plenty, the underrated Suzuki Alto Works deserves a feature. Being a perfect combination of light weight and power, Ford Fiesta drivers will finally get a worthy replacement. Suzuki Cappuccino: Following the Alto Works, the Cappuccino is another must-add Kei car. Since the Forza Horizon 5 AZ-1 debut, the demand for this car has gone even higher, and the fans are looking forward to seeing it in the next entry. Everyday Heroes Image: Playground Games Sometimes players fire up the Horizon games just to chill and cruise around with their favorite music in the background. To make this experience as relatable as possible, Playground Games should add some daily drivers to the game. Toyota Prius: Instead of just the modern-day Prius, we want to play with various generations. This includes the famous second-gen that we still see on the streets almost every day. Honda Odyssey: Last appeared in Forza Motorsport 7, this famous “soccer mom” vanguard remains absent from the franchise. Honda Odyssey making a comeback in the Japanese setting would be lovely. Toyota RAV4: This would be one of the most appreciated additions, as the RAV4 hasn’t been to a Horizon festival since the original Forza Horizon. With that, our wishlist comes to an end. Currently, there are no confirmations or even leaks supporting the appearance of these cars in Forza Horizon 6. However, being a franchise known for its extensive car roster, odds are high that these might get featured in the next best Horizon game.",2025-12-24T19:30:00+00:00,Shahmeer Shahzad,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/forza-horizon-6-car-wishlist-the-vehicles-we-want/
The Football Manager 26 Stadium Pack Mod Has Been Released,"Football Manager 26 is a game that relies on the community almost as much as it relies on the developers. Popular community mod creator BassyBoy has been working on a Stadium Megapack for months now, and the full release is finally out today. The pack features 120 stadiums from top European leagues, and even a couple from South America. BassyBoy also added a custom crowd-made system, while also adding some clever optimizations for performance. Despite being an intensive community-made mod, it runs incredibly well, even on older stadiums. In the short time since the mod has been out, there haven’t been any reports of game-breaking bugs, corrupt saves, or crashes either. Not a bad start. You can download the Stadium Megapack Mod from BassBoy ’s website. What To Expect From The Stadium Megapack This project is nothing short of a “mammoth effort,” as the creator himself describes. BassyBoy is also responsible for a realistic newgen faces pack, which fixes some of the uncanny character models in FM 26 . Here is the full breakdown of what is included in the initial V1 release: A roster of 120 stadiums that focus on the top 5 European leagues. There are also stadiums from Portugal, the Netherlands, and Turkey. The pack also features several iconic Argentinian and Brazilian grounds, including the Legia Warsaw stadium. The mod uses a unique “Crowd Inject” system. Unlike the base game, it uses real-time attendance data from your save. For example, if you have a 50,000-seat stadium but only 20,000 fans show up, the stands will realistically show empty seats. For players on lower-end systems, there are plenty of quality settings in the config files to ensure smooth performance. You do not need to start a new career. The mod is fully compatible with existing FM26 saves. Even saves from FM23 and FM24 can carry over. However, it should be noted that the mod itself isn’t compatible with any past Football Manager titles, just FM26 . While the mod is a breakthrough for the Unity-based FM26 engine, there are a few compatibility hurdles to keep in mind. BassyBoy has confirmed that the mod will not work on MacBooks with Apple Silicon at this time, and support for the Steam Deck is currently considered experimental.",2025-12-24T19:00:00+00:00,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/the-football-manager-26-stadium-pack-mod-has-been-released/

How to Get Super Wheelspins in Forza Horizon 5,"In the vast world of Forza Horizon 5 , Super Wheelspins are the undisputed bread and butter of progression. Many players focus on building a garage of the fastest cars , and Super Wheelspins are a great way of getting closer to that. Unlike a standard spin, a Super Wheelspin grants you three rewards at once, drastically increasing your odds of hitting the jackpot. You can win rare cars, large credit payouts, and even exclusive cosmetics. Now, you get normal Wheelspins for levelling up, completing accolades, and advancing through the story. However, Super Wheelspins are a bit rarer and are obtained by spending Skill Points on certain cars’ Car Mastery Trees. The way to farm hundreds of Super Wheelspins is a straightforward one: first, gain large amounts of Skill Points, and then, buy cost-efficient cars and redeem their Car Mastery perks. The Art Of Skill Point Farming The most essential part of getting Super Wheelspins is farming a stockpile of Skill Points (SP). These are earned by performing skill chains during normal gameplay, but for efficient farming, you need a high-multiplier car and a good location to farm at. You earn 1 Skill Point for every 50,000 Skill Score you bank. To be efficient, reach a 500,000 score as fast as possible for 10 SP. 1. The High-Multiplier Hoonigan Drift: Use a car that is famous for its high skill multiplier, preferably the Hoonigan Ford RS200 Evolution or the Hoonigan Hunicorn V1, as both can reach a 7x skill chain multiplier. Head towards the vast airfield and consistently drift up and down the runway, smashing fences, and using the massive area to build a huge chain. Again, the necessary part is that you bank your skill chain once you hit a score of 500,000 to earn the maximum 10 Skill Points per chain. If you choose to bank any higher than that, you will waste your time and score. 2. The 18-second Event Lab Blueprint For anyone looking for a semi-automated farming method, consider using the Event Lab. What you want to do is go to Event Blueprints and search for the title “18s”. With this search, you’ll be able to find user-created events to bank the 500,000 skill score immediately. If you’re looking for recommendations for what car to use, then go with the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento Forza Edition. Once you’ve done the above steps, just start the event and set the driving presets to ultimate. Make sure steering is set to Auto Steering and shifting is automatic. 3. The Peel Trident Now, for players with low credit scores, the best care to use is the Peel Trident. Anyone can get this car easily, and this is why this method is the cheapest and most skill-point efficient way to convert Skill Points into Super Wheelspins. The Peel Trident costs a mere 25,000 Credits in the Auto Show. The Trident’s Car Mastery offers a Super Wheelspin for a total cost of just 9 skill points. This way is the best value for new players or for anyone looking to maximise their Super Wheelspin acquisition, while also minimising credit spending. It’s really simple: just buy the car, redeem the mastery, then just discard or sell the car to get your credits back. Bulk Farming For High Rollers For players who have plenty of credits saved up, you can easily speed up the farming process by using cars that yield multiple Super Wheelspins at once. The most reliable choice for this would be the Porsche 918 Spider. This is a solid, cost-effective option for bulk farming. The car costs approximately 196,000 credits in the Auction House, and its Car Mastery costs 26 Skill Points and provides one of each Wheelspin. Now that the mid-range option is out of the way, here’s the fastest option. You can use either the Zenvo TSR-S or the Bugatti D.Va. These options are to be considered where credits are no object, and you’re looking for the fastest farming. The Zenvo costs 1.2 million Credits from the Car Collection. Its mastery costs 21 Skill Points and grants two Super Wheelspins along with one regular wheelspin. The Bugatti costs around 500,000 Credits and costs 21 Skill Points to unlock two Super Wheespins, one regular Wheelspin, and 50,000 Credits. These options are the most expensive, but are also the most time-efficient ones for players who have no problem with spending a high amount of credits.",2025-12-23T22:00:00+00:00,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/how-to-get-super-wheelspins-in-forza-horizon-5/
Has Wreckreation Improved? A Look at the Game After Recent Updates,"Games like Wreckreation are hard to come by. You won’t often hear about a sandbox racing game that allows players to build their own tracks to race. And that’s why the direction in which the game is heading is disappointing. However, Three Fields Entertainment haven’t given up yet. Wreckreation has recently received its third major content update , and things may start looking up. After publishers pulled funding for the game, Three Fields Entertainment set up a Patreon to support future updates. While not at its max potential, the updates have still been positive overall. Let’s take a look at the state of the game following the mid-December update and what the foreseeable future holds. Breaking Down Wreckreation’s Mid-December Update Image: Three Fields Entertainment Before I give you my opinion on where the game stands, take a look at the mid-December update yourself. The update was the third major content update in the game and contained both gameplay-related and platform-related upgrades . The major crux of the update was the addition of new Live Mix buildings and objects. There are now 9 new Live Mix buildings and 22 objects to choose from when creating your racetrack of doom. A new area has also been opened up for use, Maccoll County. Three Fields Entertainment used this to announce the game’s update on X: “Maccoll County Planning Office has granted permission for the new Twining Woods Development – construction work has started and buildings are already starting to pop up ”. The story behind it is that a mountain had been cleared in Maccoll County, which led to the area being opened up. This is a major improvement, in my opinion, since sandbox games are continually expanding their maps. New areas help create a sense of intrigue amongst players. Finally, we have new video settings for both Xbox and PlayStation players. You can now choose between Quality and Performance mode. Quality mode improves the visual quality to 30 FPS and grants players better visual detail. It also targets consistent 4K resolution. Performance mode, on the other hand, keeps your system stable by lowering graphics, but providing smoother gameplay without any crashes. If you’re having trouble finding community content, Wreckreation now highlights the most played and highest rated challenges, with an additional community challenge filter available on the map. And that’s the gist of the mid-December update. State Of The Game: Has Wreckreation Improved? Image: Three Fields Entertainment/THQ Nordic It’s now time to talk about where the game stands, especially compared to its state on release. We have to take into consideration the financial constraints the studio is going through, considering THQ has reduced/stopped funding for the game. The game now runs on Patreon donations to keep making updates. I will say the game has improved quite a lot since its release. There have been a plethora of glitch fixes that have made gameplay more stable, but we have also seen great strides in gameplay. The update in early December introduced cross-play support between Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Crossplay increases the player base substantially and allows friends to easily play with each other cross-platform. They’ve also worked quite hard on visual improvements and minor details. Features with physics-related issues were fixed to increase realism, while different camera angles were also added and/or corrected. We see quite a lot more variation when it comes to building using Live Mix with all the new additions to the game. Both the Share Codes and the Current Games List were major updates to the game. Share Codes allows easy sharing of courses between friends for the user-created challenges, while the Current Games List helps players find more active sessions. These were necessary features following the release of crossplay. And last, but definitely not least, quality-of-life changes. Whether those were fixing game crashes, memory leaks, or simply AI behaviour, Three Fields Entertainment really went all out to keep this game afloat. While Wreckreation might not be everything we were hoping for, the game has improved significantly and continues to do so. The Future Of Wreckreation I understand the skepticism regarding the future of the game, given that it hasn’t fulfilled all its promises. The game is currently in a rocky state, not due to a lack of effort by developers, but rather a financing issue. Depending on how the Patreon situation goes and whether Three Fields Entertainment can find another publisher, we might just see the game’s revival. For now, nothing can be said for certain about the future. But if you were disappointed by the game at launch, I’d definitely recommend giving it another try.",2025-12-23T21:30:00+00:00,Shahmeer Shahzad,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/has-wreckreation-improved-a-look-at-the-game-after-recent-updates/
When Will EA FC 26 Come To Xbox Game Pass?,"After the Madden 26 Game Pass prediction, football fans are hungry for more. This is because College Football and Madden games aside, EA FC also follows a similar tradition when it comes to joining the Xbox Game Pass catalogue. With EA FC 24 and EA FC 25 already available for subscribers to download, they can’t wait for the latest installment to drop as well. To satisfy their curiosity, here’s when we can expect EA FC 26 to arrive on Game Pass, according to the trend followed by its predecessors. Things To Consider Image by Operation Sports Before we start, keep in mind that whatever conclusion we reach is purely speculative. As of yet, no official update from Xbox or EA has dropped regarding the EA FC 26 Game Pass situation. Still, for Ultimate subscribers, who can’t wait to get behind the game of two halves, a 10-hour free trial giving a complete test drive is available. Without further delay, let’s start with our analysis. Pattern Followed By Previous EA FC/FIFA Games The data, which will help us estimate a promising Game Pass entry date for this game, comes from the pattern followed by its predecessor. From FIFA 23 to EA FC 25, here’s when each joined Xbox Game Pass after their release. EA FC/FIFA Title Game Release Date Game Pass Addition Date FIFA 23 30th September 2022 16th May 2023 EA FC 24 29th September 2023 25th June 2024 EA FC 25 27th September 2024 12th June 2025 Judging by the table, each game has been added to the catalogue 8 to 9 months after the original release date. When Will EA FC 26 Come To Xbox Game Pass? With all of the intel in mind, adding around 9 months to the EA FC 26 release date gives us its unofficial Game Pass entry date. By doing the math, the subscribers can expect the game on 26th June 2026, which is nearly 6 months away from today. With still plenty of time left, those who are not planning to buy the game separately have no choice but to continue enjoying EA FC 25. That’s all for now. As mentioned earlier, this is an unofficial prediction. If we are lucky, we might get an early Game Pass entrance; otherwise, waiting or buying the game are the only choices.",2025-12-23T21:00:00+00:00,Shahmeer Shahzad,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/when-will-ea-fc-26-come-to-xbox-game-pass/
New Tease Sparks Speculation About AAA’s Presence in WWE 2K26,"As we inch closer to the WWE 2K26 release , there are quite a lot of questions around new wrestlers making their way to the game. For weeks, there has been a lot of speculation that AAA wrestlers will make their debut in 2K26 . Today, Adrian Butler , senior referee for WWE NXT and producer for Mexico’s Lucha Libre AAA, further stirred the pot with the following post on Twitter/X: The excitement and anticipation for @WWEgames #wwe2k26 has begun! Not a bad idea, @NutshellTheFan ! #LuchaLibreAAA pic.twitter.com/SayQy8s3mW — Darryl Sharma (@AdrianButlerWWE) December 22, 2025 The post shows a photo of Adrian Butler (Darryl Sharma) himself alongside other AAA referees. With the caption featuring the WWE 2K26 hashtag, this is a direct nod to the possibility of AAA’s inclusion in WWE 2K26. For years, the WWE 2K series has focused on the WWE umbrella exclusively. The developers occasionally dip into ECW or WCW for nostalgia, but anything beyond that remains to be seen. What The AAA Partnership Could Look Like For WWE 2K26 We previously talked about whether or not TNA stars can make an appearance in WWE 2K26 . The problem with that idea is that WWE doesn’t own TNA, so getting rights/licenses for wrestlers can be time-consuming and costly. That same problem doesn’t exist with AAA, as WWE basically owns them. Here’s what a user on the r/WWEGames subreddit thinks: “If I were gonna put money on it, I’d say you’ll probably get 2-3 AAA guys plus an arena as unlockables in the MyRise and anyone beyond that’ll be DLC.” Maybe we see a dedicated “Lucha Libre” chapter in MyRise. The mode could ask players to travel to Mexico and compete in a recreation of the iconic Triplemania area. This would allow 2K to introduce a handful of high-profile AAA stars — the likes of Mr. Iguana, Psycho Clown, and Pagano. However, given the technical hurdles of full-roster integration, the DLC route seems to be the most logical. By including a couple of marquee names as unlockables, they can test the waters for interest in a dedicated AAA DLC pack down the line. This might please the hardcore fanbase, but more importantly, give some variety to a series that lacks Mexican/indie wrestling influence and culture. If the tease we’ve seen today is any indication, that boundary may get erased soon.",2025-12-23T20:30:00+00:00,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/new-tease-sparks-speculation-about-aaas-presence-in-wwe-2k26/

Sentenced to Be a Hero anime to air in January,"Photo credit: ©2024 Rocket Shokai/KADOKAWA/Project Sentenced to Be a Hero Forthcoming anime series Sentenced to Be a Hero will premiere next month. The series will debut on Saturday, January 3 via Crunchyroll. A new trailer for the show, which can be seen here , features the first listen of the show’s theme song “Kill The Noise” by Spyair. The J-rock band said this about the new song: We created this song with a fast-paced beat that shines during the battle scenes, a deep solid sound that resonates with the feelings of those burdened by their crimes, and the theme of “crime and punishment”, including lyrics that aligned with the anime’s world view. Despite it being a heavy and serious song, it’s become a track that’s uniquely ours, one that encourages its listeners by giving them a push forward. The title carries the meaning of severing the “interference” from one’s surroundings, as well as the “doubts” that arise from within oneself. Combined with the high-quality visuals, “Kill the Noise” is cooler than ever, so please look forward to it! A synopsis for Sentenced to Be a Hero reads: ""Hero"" is the worst punishment in the world. For those convicted of heinous crimes, they are sentenced to become a “Hero"" and forced to enter the mandatory military service in the war against the Demon Lords. These convicts are not even allowed to die—if killed, they will be resurrected to fight another day. Hero Xylo Forbartz, former head of the Order of the Holy Knights, leads a penal unit of deplorables fighting on the front lines. It’s in these direst of circumstances that he meets Teoritta, one of the world’s the strongest weapons. ""When every last enemy has been defeated, you are to shower me with praise and pat my head."" In order to survive and to take revenge on those who wronged him, he makes a pact with the goddess and launches headfirst into a maelstrom of war and intrigue. The anime series is an adaptation of Rocket Shokai’s novel series of the same name. The novel series is available via Yen Press here .

Halloween is leaving Dead By Daylight,"Dead By Daylight is losing a major licensed franchise. Revealed yesterday , Halloween will be exiting the game on January 19 at 11 a.m. EST/8 a.m. PST. Michael Myers and Laurie Strode will be available for purchase for 50% off until they’re officially removed from the game. Unfortunately, the Haddonfield Map will also exit the game. A detailed FAQ can be found here . A statement from Dead by Daylight reads: Dead by Daylight: Halloween, featuring Michael Myers, Laurie Strode, and Haddonfield, is leaving The Fog. Halloween came to Dead by Daylight in October 2016, marking the first legendary horror film to be added to the game as a license. Its arrival was a historic turning point, the first stone in an avalanche of cinematic horror icons. Yet even the most incredible Halloween night must come to an end. Dead by Daylight is a live service game, and there’s always the possibility that unexpected changes may occur. On January 19th, 2026, 11 AM ET, The Halloween Chapter and all associated content will no longer be available to unlock in Dead by Daylight. For those who already own The Shape, Laurie Strode, and/or any of their Cosmetics, your content will remain accessible to you. If you’re interested in unlocking any Halloween characters or Cosmetics, we’ll be holding a Last Chance 50% off sale until it departs The Fog for good. If you’re reading this and do not own the characters, please note that The Shape and Laurie Strode’s Perks will undergo name changes. They will be added to the General Perk pool and available in the Bloodweb for everyone. Associated Charms and Achievements will be updated to reflect these changes. The Shape’s Perks Save The Best For Last -> Keep Them Waiting Play With Your Food -> See How They Run Dying Light -> Cull The Weak Laurie Strode’s Perks Sole Survivor -> Down To The Last Object of Obsession -> Bound by Obsession Decisive Strike – Will To Live If you already own the characters, Perk names and descriptions will remain unchanged, as well the Perk-related Charms. This departure comes months after Hellraiser was removed from Dead by Daylight . Previously removed franchises Stranger Things and Attack on Titan both made their return to the game, so fans are hoping the same can happen here.

Ghost Cam comes to Steam and Meta VR headsets in January,"Arch Rebels’ single-player paranormal title Ghost Cam will arrive early next year on Steam and Meta VR headsets. Revealed during Wednesday’s Women-Led Games Showcase: The Game Awards Edition, the game will launch on January 19. A new trailer, which can be seen here , showcases the game in both VR and non-VR action. A synopsis for Ghost Cam reads: In GHOST CAM, you play as a lone paranormal photographer exploring shifting, liminal spaces filled with ghostly traces and hidden secrets. Armed only with a Polaroid-style camera, you’ll capture spirits, uncover spectral remnants, and piece together escape-room-style puzzles to delve deeper into a twisting, haunted dreamscape. Set against a surreal 70s/80s haunted horse girl aesthetic, GHOST CAM invites players into eerie stables, faded childhood memories, and corridors where ghostly hoofbeats linger just out of sight. Not all spirits are hostile; some will watch, some will guide, and some may trap you forever in their world. Your actions shape your Ghost Hunter ranking, unlock hidden mysteries, and determine which of the endings you'll uncover. Inspired by modern psychological horror titles but crafted for a focused solo narrative experience, GHOST CAM delivers chilling atmosphere, emotional tension, and rich replayability. Players can immerse themselves in full VR or on a traditional screen. Steam users can wishlist the game here while Meta VR users can wishlist the game here . We're excited to announce that GHOST CAM will be haunting the @womenledgames Showcase✨ #TheGameAwards Edition on: Dec 11th 8am WA / 11am AEDT Dec 10th 4pm PT Watch the full show here: www.youtube.com/@Women-LedGa... ! #indiegames #indiedev #gamedev #vr [image or embed] — Wishlist GHOST CAM on Steam👻 ( @archrebels.bsky.social ) December 9, 2025 at 7:49 PM",2025-12-12T17:13:36+00:00,Terrance Pryor,MP3s & NPCs,https://mp3sandnpcs.com/home/ghost-cam-comes-to-steam-and-meta-vr-in-january
Bradley the Badger announced from Day 4 Night Studios,"Day 4 Night Studios, which was co-founded by Christian Cantamessa ( Red Dead Redemption, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor ) and Davide Soliani (creative lead on Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, Sparks of Hope, and Rayman in the Phantom Show ), has announced their new action-adventure game at The Game Awards tonight . Bradley the Badger , which will be released on PC (via Steam), merges action-adventure with live-action sequences to deliver what is sure to be a unique experience. Evan Peters ( X-Men, Mare of Easttown, Dahmer, Tron:Ares ) stars as the titular character in both live-action and voice-over work. An announcement trailer can be seen here . Cantamessa said this about the game: “Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them. Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them. From the inner turmoil of self-doubt to the joy of building worlds, we set out to transform those experiences into a game that anyone can get lost in.” Soliani also said: “We wanted to make something that would reignite us, something capable of taking us back in time to when, with younger eyes, the whole world of videogames seemed to shine. And we wanted our mechanics to be the perfect bridge between the past and the future.” A synopsis for Bradley the Badger reads: Bradley, the iconic star of numerous hit platforming games in the past, finds himself lost in strange new lands that, to him, look utterly alien and weirdly unfinished. Longing to return home, Bradley embarks on a journey to save his world and his friends at all costs, even if that means coming face to face with a revelation bigger than anything he ever imagined. At the heart of the game is the Kit. It’s a tool that lets Bradley modify every unfinished asset he can find, just as if he was a game developer. It’s systemic, immediate, and completely transforms the approach to exploration, traversal, puzzles, and combat. Using the Kit and his trusty frying pan, Bradley must navigate worlds that players will find instantly familiar, but littered with unfinished elements. Over the course of the game, Bradley will explore, solve puzzles, defeat bosses, and unravel a broader mystery. Bradley the Badger can be wishlisted on Steam right now here .

To coincide with the signing, the artist has delivered their new single “Just A Shadow” today . An animated music video created by Costin Chioreanu can be seen here . Williams said this about the new song: “‘Just A Shadow’ is an ode to the darkness inside. A part of you since you can remember, a cruel friend lurking just outside of view. A presence that you’ve accepted, its familiarity brings cold comfort. You’ve tried to resist it and step into the light, but you’re scared that you’re nothing without the dark.” RPM co-founder Gerardo Martinez also said: “A.A. WILLIAMS is one of the most compelling voices in contemporary music. She is unafraid to explore vulnerability with a rare poetic depth. We’re honored to welcome her to the RPM family, and ‘Just A Shadow’ is a stunning introduction to what we’ll build together.” RELATED: Sleep Token and A.A.

Justin Khan, producer at Nightdive Studios said this about the forthcoming port: “With how the Switch port of System Shock is shaping up — running very smoothly and looking quite good, it could be considered an ‘Impossible Port,’ in the same way that Doom 2016, Wolfenstein, and Witcher 3 are considered Impossible Ports on the Switch 1. We think fans will be very pleased with the performance and platform-specific functionality we’ve delivered with these System Shock ports for Nintendo’s consoles.” Justin Khan, producer at Nightdive Studios also said: “Nightdive’s goal was to deliver a System Shock port that sits alongside technical feats like DOOM 2016 and The Witcher 3 on the Nintendo Switch. To achieve that, we retained deferred rendering to keep our dynamic lighting intact, which is a massive challenge on this hardware. We are incredibly proud of the result, and hope the fans feel we’ve earned a spot among those ‘Impossible Ports.’” The System Shock remake can be wishlisted on the Nintendo Switch right now here .

Why Players Watch Casino Streams Before They Play,"Before placing a single spin or opening a game for themselves, many players choose to watch someone else play first. Casino streaming has grown into its own viewing habit, and the reasons behind it are more practical than people assume. It isn’t just entertainment. It’s a way to understand how a game behaves in real time without needing to learn through trial and error. Seeing the Real Pace of a Game Screenshots and promotional clips tell you almost nothing about how a game feels. Streams, on the other hand, reveal the actual rhythm. You see how quickly rounds move, how long bonus features take, and whether the screen feels crowded or clean when the action starts. A fast-loop slot, a slow-build feature, a crash game that resolves in seconds, each has its own tempo. Watching someone else play lets viewers decide whether that tempo suits how they like to engage with a game. It’s the same logic people use when checking a gameplay video before buying a console title. You aren’t looking for a guarantee. You’re checking compatibility. Understanding Features Without Guesswork Most games are packed with elements that only make sense once you see them in motion. Cascades, respins, hold-and-win rounds, multipliers, expanding reels explanations help, but real footage shows how these mechanics actually interact. This is one of the reasons so many viewers who explore online casino South Africa platforms from well-known names such as Betway , turn to streams first. Streams offer that clarity. You watch how often a feature appears. You see whether the screen becomes too busy. You notice which animations interrupt the flow and which ones blend smoothly. All of this helps players understand the structure of the game long before they consider trying it themselves. The Value of an Unedited Session What separates streams from highlight reels is the unfiltered timeline. Nothing is cut out. Every round is shown, including the quiet stretches. That authenticity is why people trust streams more than polished previews. Viewers see the natural ups and downs. They observe how often stakes are adjusted, how long it takes to reach a feature, how dead sessions look, and how the pace changes over time. It creates a realistic picture that is impossible to get from marketing clips. The Social Layer Casino streams are also social. Chat rooms bring in people from everywhere, reacting to the same moment at the same time. The shared timeline makes the experience feel communal even if everyone is watching from home. This interaction changes the way people view the game. Instead of staring at a screen alone, viewers discuss features, ask questions, compare notes, and comment on the streamer’s choices. It becomes a low-pressure space to learn the basics before playing independently. Learning Through Observation Watching a streamer handle decisions in real time teaches more than any guide. It shows how people interpret animations, when they adjust their approach, and how they react to slow rounds or sudden surprises. Observers pick up small cues: when to stay patient, when to reset, when to change the pace. Even without copying anything directly, the viewer becomes familiar with the game’s language. By the time they play, nothing feels unfamiliar. A Way to Test Interest Without Commitment Ultimately, people watch casino streams for the same reason they watch gameplay previews in other genres. It’s a way to decide what feels right for their style. They get to explore new games, see how they behave, and sense whether the experience looks enjoyable before doing anything themselves. In a landscape filled with thousands of titles, streams provide a clear, honest window. No pressure, no urgency, just a chance to understand the game in its natural environment before stepping in.

ARC Raiders Locked Gate Event Guide & Is It Even Worth Doing?,"The Locked Gate event is exclusive to the Blue Gate map in ARC Raiders, and you might be wondering if it’s even worth doing it with how tough it sounds. This event puts some limitations on the map, for one, which makes it harder to extract safely. It can also be pretty competitive, since the rewards are mostly in one spot. However, dealing with the challenges has its rewards, as you can get some fantastic loot! In this guide, we’ll tell you how to do this even and go over its benefits and downsides. How to Do the Locked Gate Event The Locked Gate event is exclusive to the Blue Gate map. It happens every 12 hours and it has the following noteworthy modifiers going on for it: Fewer active Return Points. No active Raider Hatches. You can find Security Codes at specific locations. Land mines are hidden all over the map. Raid maximum time is 40 minutes. Rocketeers spawn at Pilgrim’s Peak. The main goal for this event is the Gate Control Room by the Warehouse Complex area. Visit that room to find 4 different terminals. Each one of the 4 terminals requires a Security Code from a different location on the map. They are as follows: Ancient Fort on the south. Pilgrim’s Peak on the northeast. Raider’s Refuge on the northwest. Reinforced Reception on the north. Go to these 4 locations and loot every single container you can. Every container at those POIs has a random chance to contain the area’s respective Security Code. Of course, your goal here is to collect all 4 Security Codes, one per location. Once you’ve done that, head to the Security Control Room and use the Security Codes to activate all 4 terminals there. When done, a notification will flash to all Raiders in the match notifying them of the Outer Gates opening! So, you’ll next want to go to the Outer Gates location in the center of the map. You can head right into the underground section as you would normally when the event isn’t active. The difference being, there’s a lot of great loot in the entire underground section now! Most notable is the Bobcat SMG Blueprint, which is very common in this area. So, happy looting! So, Is It Even Worth Doing? If you want the Bobcat Blueprint, the event is definitely worth participating in. In fact, you don’t even need to really engage with it for that, just play on the Blue Gate map while it’s active. That’s because the Bobcat Blueprint can actually spawn anywhere on the entirety of Blue Gate while the event is active. You don’t need to specifically go to the underground section, although the blueprint is definitely more common there. As you might imagine, the bad part of the event is that it’s likely to be very competitive. Other players will race you to the loot whenever the gates open, and PvP is extremely likely. On the other hand, you can use that to your advantage. Stay away from the main locations for the event and you should be able to avoid most players, getting all of the loot they’re likely to ignore. If you do fully engage with the event, the underground area has a lot of rare loot within once opened. This includes weapons, Augment blueprints, weapon blueprints, and more. It’s a great source of loot, if you can deal with the competition. So, in summary, we highly recommend participating in this event. It has great loot if you fully engage with it, and a good chance to get the Bobcat Blueprint event if you don’t. It’s not bad at all! So, the Locked Gate event in ARC Raiders is definitely worth doing. Speaking of events, are you trying to do the Flickering Flames project as well? We can help with that! Check out our Flickering Flames item locations guide.

ARC Raiders The Clean Dream Quest Guide,"“The Clean Dream” is a quest you can get from Apollo in ARC Raiders after the Cold Snap update. Apollo believes he could make even better explosives if he just had some purer components. Having some extra oomph on your explosives sure would be nice against the ARCs! So, why not help him out with this one? Well, let us help you help Apollo! Read on for our quick guide for this quest. The Clean Dream | Quest Guide For this quest, you’ll need to go inside the tunnels in the center of the Spaceport map. As we mentioned before, you can enter it from any of the holes on the surface in the map’s center. Once you’re in the tunnels, you need to search and loot 4 different containers. This doesn’t have to be any specific ones, either. Any of them will do! So, just enjoy looting the place. After you’ve done that, you’ll need to find and monitor any of the filtration systems in the tunnel. There’s an easy one to find in the very middle part of the tunnel, shown above. Next up, you’ll need to extract from the Spaceport map. You’ll now need to go to Maintenance Bunker in the Blue Gate map. Once you get there, go downstairs to find a large purification system tank inside the bunker. As before, interact with it to monitor it. Then, go upstairs from the purification system and enter the room there to find some blueprints on a table. Interact to take a photo of them, and the quest is done! Extract and report to Apollo and you’re all done with the “The Clean Dream” quest in ARC Raiders! For help with the rest of the Cold Snap update quests, check out our full guide on all of them.

ARC Raiders A Toxic Trail Quest Guide,"“A Toxic Trail” is a quest that was added to ARC Raiders with the Cold Snap update. For this quest, Shani requires you to look into who’s been sabotaging the water supply. You have clean water again, after all, and you don’t want the toxic waste getting people ill. Somebody’s responsible, time to find out who… In this quick guide, we’ll help you complete this quest as easily as possible. A Toxic Trail | Quest Guide For this quest, you’ll need to go to the northern part of the Water Treatment Control building in the Dam Battlegrounds map. As shown above, you should find the Flood Spill Intake. It’s an intake of wastewater with a barrel. Simply walking near that barrel is enough to mark the first objective of the quest as completed. It’s nasty, but somebody’s gotta do it! Once you’ve done that, go a bit west into the swamp. You should find an abandoned truck with some barrels there. Approach the truck and you’ll get two prompts. One is to take a photo of the barrels on the truck’s bed. Do that, then interact with one of the truck’s front wheels. All of your objectives are done as soon as you finish investigating the truck! So, you just need to extract and report your findings to Shani to finish the quest at this point. That’s all there is to the “A Toxic Trail” quest. It’s a fairly simple one!

How To Solve ARC Raiders NEW Puzzle Room On Buried City,"The Cold Snap update added a new puzzle room to the Buried City map in ARC Raiders , and it took a lot of work from the community to solve. There are a lot of buttons you need to find hidden all over the place, and making a single mistake resets the puzzle. Everyone in the lobby needs to work together, too, so it can be hard to organize! In this guide, we’ll tell you everything you need to solve this new puzzle. Buried City Music Note Puzzle Room Basics Alright, let’s start at the beginning for this one. You can find the puzzle room in the Buried City on the bottom floor of the building north of the Red Tower marker. Once you get there, you’ll find an ominous locked door and a button. You’ll also notice there are 15 lights turned off on the wall next to the door, as well as a “d” music note. This music note corresponds with the nearby button, for reference. In the adjacent room, you’ll find the key to this puzzle: a music sheet with 15 notes. So, the solution to the puzzle is relatively simple! At least, on paper. You have to explore the Buried City map and find all 15 hidden buttons. At the same time, you’ll need to press the buttons in the same sequence as shown on the music sheet clue. Each button has a music note near it that lets you know which part of the sequence it is. Also, each button you press will turn on 1 of the 15 lights by the final door. The goal is, of course, to turn all of them on. The trick here is, of course, that you need to explore the whole map. What’s more, you also need to press all 15 buttons in order. Pressing any button out of order will turn off all the lights, resetting the entire puzzle. So, despite being simple on paper, this puzzle is actually quite tricky! Thankfully, the ARC Raiders community has already cracked this one in record time. Puzzle Map and Solution Puzzle Hunt Map courtesy of the ARC Raiders Puzzle Discord. Now that you know the basics, we recommend referring to the map above, courtesy of the ARC Raiders community. It shows you all 15 button locations in the Buried City, as well as the order. Plus, the community’s puzzle hunt map site also has screenshots of the exact locations of these buttons if you click on them. So, we recommend it as it makes the hunt a lot easier. That said, here’s a brief text recap of each location in order, for extra reference: Inside the western building in Plaza Rosa , on the second floor. Inside the building opposite of the Space Travel building, south of the Galleria. In the lone Warehouse on the westernmost part of the Buried City. Inside the stall in the eastern part of Marano Park. Inside the Grandioso Apartments building, on the top floor. On the tower connected to the highway near Piazza Arbusto. Inside an abandoned bus north of the Library . In the building north of Corso da Vinci, in a bedroom on the top floor. In a very broken-down building on the eastern part of the building, by a Field Depot. At the Hospital , under the stairs on the bottom floor. On the roof under the caved highway east of Grandioso Apartments. On the roof of the southernmost buried building at the Church Ruins. In the attic at the top of the western building at Santa Maria Houses. Inside the buried tower northwest of Piazza Roma. Finally, the location from the start: the room north of the Red Tower marker. If you and everyone in your lobby press the buttons in the right order, fireworks will go off and the room will open! You can now go in and loot it to your heart’s content, at long last! There are a lot of guitars there… That’s how to solve the new puzzle room in the Buried City in ARC Raiders.

ARC Raiders Groundbreaking Quest Guide,"If you’re working through ARC Raiders ’ questlines and just hit the Groundbreaking quest , don’t worry, it sounds more complicated than it actually is. This quest is short, straightforward, and mostly about going to the right places in the right order. In this guide, I’ll walk you through every step , show you exactly where to go, and point out a few small tips so you don’t waste time (or lose quest items). Let’s get into it. Enter the Locked Room at Pilgrim’s Peak Here’s a video on where to enter the Locked Room at Pilgrim’s Peak for the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . Once you accept the quest, Apollo will hand you the Blue Gate Communication Tower Key . First things first: put that key in your safe pocket . You really don’t want to lose it mid-raid. Next, queue into the Blue Gate map . From there, head to Pilgrim’s Peak , located in the far northeastern corner of the map . You’ll know you’re in the right spot when you see the tall tower . Enter the building, then turn left and keep moving forward until you reach a locked door . If the door is already open, even better, just walk straight in. Search the Room for Construction Research Here’s a video on where to find the Construction Research Whiteboard while searching the room for the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . Inside the locked room, check the corner of the room for a whiteboard . Interact with it, and this objective is instantly completed. Simple enough, but don’t leave yet, because that whiteboard is important for the next step. Find the Building Pictured on the Whiteboard Here’s a video on how to find the building pictured on the whiteboard for the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . Now things get slightly less obvious. Take a close look at the photo on the whiteboard . The image points you toward a location near the abandoned housing area shown on the map. Head to that area, and once you’re close enough to the correct building, the objective will complete automatically , no extra interaction needed. Photograph the Abandoned Housing Project Here’s a video on how to photograph the Abandoned Housing Project to complete the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . For the final step, you’ll need to take a photo , but not just anywhere. Nearby, you’ll find a specific rock with an interaction circle . Stand on or near that rock, interact with the prompt, and your character will take the photo. Once the picture is taken, that’s it, you’ve officially completed the Groundbreaking quest . Wrap-Up And that’s the ARC Raiders Groundbreaking quest from start to finish. It’s a quick, no-nonsense mission as long as you know where to go, and now you do. If you’re chaining quests or working toward unlocking more cosmetics and gear, this one’s an easy win. Grab your rewards, move on to the next objective, and keep raiding. Up next, I recommend that you also check out my complete guide for the Cold Snap event in Arc Raiders. It includes stuff like snow maps, surviving frostbite, completing the Flickering Flames event, finding Candleberries, and unlocking new outfits and rewards. Check it out!

ARC Raiders: Cold Snap Event Guide | How Frostbite Works,"The Cold Snap winter event is officially live in ARC Raiders , and in this guide, I’ll break down everything you need to know , from playing on snow maps, surviving frostbite, completing the Flickering Flames event, finding Candleberries, and unlocking new outfits and rewards. How to Play on a Snow Map To play on a snow-covered map, keep in mind that not every map will have snow active at the same time . The Cold Snap event rotates between maps, so you’ll need to manually select and join the Cold Snap map to experience the winter environment. Once you’re in, the real challenge begins. How Frostbite Works Here’s a video on how Frostbite works on the Cold Snap event of ARC Raiders ! The Cold Snap event introduces a new mechanic called Frostbite . If you stay outdoors for a few minutes , your character will start reacting to the cold. After about a minute, you’ll notice your character shivering , and as time passes, snow will visibly build up on your clothing , a really cool visual detail from Embark that you don’t see in many games. After roughly three minutes outdoors , frostbite kicks in fully and your health will start ticking down slowly . That’s your cue to get indoors immediately . Once you enter a building, the damage stops, and the frostbite effect begins to reverse. If you go back outside too soon, you won’t take damage right away, but the shivering and snow buildup will return, and after a few more minutes, the health drain starts again. Tip: Stay indoors until the snow patches on your character disappear. That’s when it’s safe to head back out. I also tested a few edge cases: Standing near a balcony doesn’t trigger frostbite, the game considers it indoors. Areas like covered parking with open sides still count as outdoors, so frostbite applies there. Flickering Flames Event Explained Next up is the Flickering Flames event . To access it, go to Raider → Projects → Flickering Flames . The event has five stages , and each one requires you to collect specific items like: Empty wine bottles Light bulbs Plastic pots And a unique item called Candleberries Let’s talk about where to find those. Where to Find Candleberries Here’s a video on where to find Candleberries in ARC Raiders for the Flickering Flames Cold Snap Event! Candleberries spawn in areas with dense vegetation . For example, on Barry City , head toward sections of the map with trees, bushes, and plants , especially around the middle areas. Search through bushes carefully, they’re a bit rare, but you’ll eventually find a Candleberry tree you can loot. Once you pick them up, store them in your safe pockets immediately . You really don’t want to lose these. The same rule applies on other maps like The Dam . Anywhere with trees and vegetation is your best bet, just keep checking bushes and you’ll find them eventually. New Outfits & Cosmetics in the Cold Snap Event The Cold Snap event also adds new outfits, items, and emotes . The main highlight is the Warden Outfit . To unlock it, you’ll need to complete the Stench of Corruption quest, which is part of a new chain quest , meaning you’ll need to finish a few prerequisite quests first. Completing the Groundbreaking quest unlocks an alternate color variation of the Warden outfit as well. Wrap-Up And that’s a quick, clean breakdown of the Cold Snap and Flickering Flames events in ARC Raiders . From surviving frostbite to farming Candleberries and unlocking new cosmetics, you’re now fully prepped for the winter grind. Up next, if you still haven’t completed the Paving the Way quest in ARC Raiders , check out our guide. It includes locations, objectives and tips, so you can complete the quest with ease, and you don’t miss out on the rewards!

"Hit PS5, PS4 RPG Getting ‘Big’ DLC 11 Years After Original Launch – Report","It seems the hit PS5 and PS4 RPG, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt , is the game that keeps on giving. 11 years after its original launch in 2015, it will receive a “big” DLC that is rumored to bridge the gap between the award-winning RPG and the upcoming sequel, The Witcher 4. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will receive DLC 11 years after launch In a report from Polish publication Strefa Inwestorow , Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowksi updated the schedules and budgets for CD Projekt Red. Chrzanowski predicted that the studio is working on a DLC for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which will kickstart the marketing campaign for The Witcher 4, as it will connect the last game to the upcoming sequel. He also suggested this DLC would release in May 2026, while The Witcher 4 will release in Q4 2027. “We expect the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026. We assume sales of 11 million copies at $30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million. The release should kick off the proper marketing campaign for The Witcher 4,” the translated report reads. From this report, not much else is said about the supposed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt DLC. However, back in June this year, Polish podcasters Rock and Boris had received some additional information about the DLC, as well as the launch schedule. “Let’s move on to our main topic,” reads a translation of the video (H/T MP1st ). “From the information we have collected, it turns out that the announced, mysterious project by CD Projekt Red, made by Fool’s Theory, is a story DLC for The Witcher 3. This is confirmed information from several independent sources.” “What we know is that this is a DLC for The Witcher 3,” the video continues. “Based on one piece of information, I can’t confirm it any further, but the earliest it could be is in the future year. We also more or less know the order of the releases: first, mods for consoles, then the DLC for The Witcher 3, then The Witcher 4, and finally, the remake of The Witcher 1.” The post Hit PS5, PS4 RPG Getting ‘Big’ DLC 11 Years After Original Launch – Report appeared first on PlayStation LifeStyle .",2025-12-23T20:07:39+00:00,Michael Ruiz,PlayStation LifeStyle,https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/12/23/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-dlc-report-december-2025/
Highly Anticipated PS5 Action Game Delayed by 2 Months,"(Credit: IO Interactive) IO Interactive has announced its highly anticipated PS5 action game, 007 First Light , will be delayed for two months. Despite this being potentially bad news for fans, it seems development on the game is going smoothly and that the extra months are for polish and refinement. 007 First Light is delayed until May 2026 In a statement from IO Interactive, the developer announced 007 First Light will now release on May 27, 2026. It was originally set to release on March 27, 2026. “007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully foucesed on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more,” begins the statement. “As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.” “The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch,” continues the statement. “We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game.” Although it has been known that IO Interactive was working on a James Bond video game, they officially unveiled the title and first trailer for 007 First Light during the June 2025 PlayStation State of Play .

"PSA: PSN Accounts Can Be Hacked Even With 2FA, Passkey Enabled","PlayStation’s security woes continue, as it has been recently reported that PlayStation Network (PSN) accounts can be hacked even if two-factor authentication (2FA) and a passkey are enabled. It seems that even with minimal information, hackers are able to take control of PSN accounts by contacting Sony support agents. How are PSN accounts getting hacked? In a recent report from French publication Numerama, tech journalist Nicolas Lellouche detailed how he had his PSN account hacked, which was protected with a passkey. The hacker was able to change the email and password, as well as spend money from a linked payment option. Although Lellouche was able to recover his account with the help of PlayStation Support, the hacker was able to take control of the account a second time. This led to Lellouche actually speaking with the hacker, who initially mocked him by telling him to contact support. They then confirmed that the security flaw pertains to how account ownership is verified. In this case, the hacker only needed a transaction number, which was found in a screenshot the original owner had posted online back in 2023, and the account’s username. That was all it took for Sony to hand over the PSN account to the hacker. Lellouche also found that Sony would accept last digits on a payment card or the serial number of a console. Agents don’t ask for name, date of birth, answer to secret question, etc. This is not the first time users have been targeted in a similar manner. Following Lellouche’s tweet, other users detailed their experiences, and in some cases, they ended up losing their account for good. In a situation that was made more public, roughly a year ago, the former number one trophy hunter, Hakoom , detailed his experience with a hacker and PlayStation support, which ended with him getting his account back, but fractured his relationship with PlayStation PR. A few months ago, the current number one trophy hunter, dav1d_123 , also got his information stolen with the account put up for sale on Telegram. Sony has yet to comment on these hacks or plug the loophole. Until they do, which may take a very long time, just be sure not to share any information regarding a PSN account online for the foreseeable future.

"PS5, PS4 Blockbuster Game Half Price at Retail After Just 1 Month","What was expected to be the annual PS5, PS4 blockbuster game for 2025 has turned out to be a dud for publisher Activision, it seems. Not long after the company admitted that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 fell well short of expectations, retailers are heavily discounting the game, which is unprecedented for a Call of Duty title a month after launch. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 dethroned as 2025’s biggest PS5, PS4 game Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is currently just $39.99 at Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon. At one point over the last week, the game was also available for as low as $34.99. This represents savings of 43% to 50% — again, unprecedented for a Call of Duty game after just one month. Battlefield 6 and surprise hit Arc Raiders are both credited with putting a dent in Black Ops 7’s sales. Call of Duty games have faced little to no competition in recent years. Prior to Black Ops 7’s launch, Activision claimed that it wasn’t worried about rival Battlefield 6’s positive reception. Shortly after launch, the company acknowledged player complaints and announced a series of changes, including but not limited to putting an end to back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare and Black Ops games.

"Shadow of the Tomb Raider Free on PS Store, Thanks to Glitch","Update: All good things come to an end. After almost 10 hours, Sony has fixed the glitch. There are currently no reports of licenses being revoked, however. Original story follows… A known PS Store glitch has struck again, making Eidos Montreal’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider completely free for players. The glitch was first noticed by players based in Hong Kong, but has since been confirmed by folks with PSN accounts in other regions as well. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is currently free in several regions’ PS Store To claim a free copy, players need to have a PSN account in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, or Australia. Go to Shadow of the Tomb Raider’s PS Store page and select its demo.

Players on Reddit have confirmed that the glitch still works at the time of this writing. However, do note that Sony has in the past revoked licenses for games that were accidentally made free.

Review: R-Type Delta: HD Boosted (Nintendo Switch),"We have a shmup on deck for you, so what time is it? Time to open fire! Our game today is a new entry in one of the all-time great series: R-Type Delta: HD Boosted. The R-Type is back and ready to satisfy your shmuppy desires. Straight off the launch pad, the HD visuals are very good. While the gameplay graphics are not as slick as the ship intro (and in the intros, the ships do look really cool) the visuals are very well done. Before starting out, the game will present you with a launch tower in an area a bit reminiscent of Blade Runner. Once you select your R-Type, you launch into the night to defend the world. Since this is a shmup, the basic movement of your ship is 2D. However, the graphics and the paths of some of the bad guys are 3D. The combination is well done and easy for the player to work with. The soundtrack is equally well done and provides the right level of tension balanced with heroic battle themes. The music doesn’t distract, it actually helps the player become immersed in the game, just as it should. The sound effects are also appropriate to the action and sometimes quite satisfying. This is more evidence that the developers have put forth a valiant effort to make sure everything about this game is just right; they really know what a shmup is all about and have nailed the story and visuals in classic anime style. This is a real treat for the gamers. When it’s time for the shooting to begin, there are some options for you. For most shmuppers, there are no surprises when you find three options at your disposal: normal shot, rapid shot, and Delta weapon (press and hold to charge). The fourth option—”force”—is extra fun. With this, if you can shoot the bonus weapon bots, you can collect a new weapon function which attaches to the nose of your ship. It will fire with the rest of your weapons normally, but if you use the “force” weapon option, it launches off the nose of your ship and flies ahead of you, providing some interesting enemy destroying options. You also have some different weapons at your disposal with the three different ships. I won’t spoil all the differences for you, but one of the ships has an attack type called “tentacle.” Yes, it’s both as odd and engaging as you might think. Another element you would expect is the difficulty range: kids, human, and Bydo (the alien baddies). I’m not going to give away all the weapons spoilers (and there are some juicy ones) but I can say that if you are feeling curious or whimsical, give the kids level a try. You get access to more weapons from the start, and it can be enough to make a merry gamer giggle with glee. Even with all those wonderful toys at your disposal, the course isn’t going to be easy. As with most shmups, you will need to memorize some of the patterns so you don’t get blown to smithereens. Even with that, there is a fair bit of skill and finesse required to get through a good portion of each level. The boss at the end of the level is no joke; you will need to focus to win. When you get blown up, and it will happen, you have to back up a bit in the level. I didn’t find this to be as sore a defeat as losing the special weapons that got picked up on the way. You don’t always get the option to re-acquire the special weapons, so getting through just got quite a bit trickier. It may seem a bit late, but the game does have some story element as well. It is mostly the usual “you are our only hope to save the world, so get to work” thing, but it is well presented and makes sense within the game. This, along with the other elements, keeps the player rooting for our hero and his plucky R-Type. Now for the big wrap-up. I have played numerous shmups in my time, and I can honestly say this is one of the best. The game touches a little retro familiarity, adds some new pop and sizzle, mixes it with some great sound, and serves it up in such a way that I was really drawn in. I found myself less frustrated at hitting a stop, and more just groaning at the loss, saying to myself “OK, let’s hit it again!” There is a classic arcade-like thrill which provides a fun variety of adrenaline ride that makes the player want to figure out the trick of the moment and to play again to show those aliens who’s boss around here.

Review: Big Trouble in Little Chimney (Nintendo Switch),"Ho ho ho! Yes, it’s that time of year again. What better way to celebrate the holiday season than by playing a Santa-themed game? What do you mean there’s no such thing as a good Christmas game? Big Trouble in Little Chimney for Nintendo Switch is here to try and set that record straight. The first thing you need to know about Big Trouble in Little Chimney (apart from the obviously cool name based on a classic ‘80s movie starring Kurt Russell) is that it looks a lot like Vampire Survivors. It’s a top-down survival outing featuring weapons, upgrades, and hordes of relentless enemies. But there’s more to it than that. You play the role of Santa—or a beefed-up version of him—who must defend the world from turkeys, elves, exploding presents, and other holiday-themed enemies. Unlike Vampire Survivors, Santa’s adventure is a twin-stick shooter. You control Santa with the left stick and aim his weapon with the right. The goal is to survive for 10 minutes in a boundless arena until Krampus arrives. Enemy numbers increase in number and difficulty during that time, making this objective hard to pull off. To assist, every felled enemy leaves a gem behind. Collecting these adds to your XP, allowing you to select from various special abilities each time you level up. You also earn coins. Elves randomly appear during your run, dolling out dimes as they flit around the field. Whether they’re good or evil is unclear; the coins are useful, though, being traded in for items in Santa’s shop between runs. There are upgrades aplenty, and it’s fun to check out the various weapons on offer. Each has its own stats in terms of damage, fire rate, and range. Do you prefer a stronger weapon that fires more slowly, or something with better range? You can also permanently upgrade your health and change your special attack at the shop. There’s even an optional pet animal (cat, dog, or duck) who will join your run and collect coins for you. It all adds to a slightly easier experience the more you play, giving you plenty of incentive to try again. Because, yeah, it’s kinda hard. Those turkeys are persistent! A few other gameplay options help matters, like an auto-aim toggle. To keep things varied, Big Trouble in Little Chimney has another mode called Giftpocalypse. This endless outing is set on a single screen with Santa protecting the presents around the Christmas tree. Elves appear from the edge of the screen to steal these presents, but a quick shot sends them back to where they came from, dropping the gifts where they were shot. You can bring them back to the center of the screen by touching them, keeping them close at hand to protect them. Your goal is to earn the highest score. Overall, Big Trouble in Little Chimney is a fun Christmas-themed game that pays homage to Vampire Survivors in a unique way. It might not be something you play for more than a few hours, but it comes at a budget price and offers plenty to do during its short runtime.

Team Cherry announces Hollow Knight and Silksong updates for 2026,"If you haven’t heard of Hollow Knight , well, you really have been missing out. This indie darling from Australian developer Team Cherry launched in 2017 on PC and 2018 on Nintendo Switch, taking the gaming world by storm. In 2025, fans were finally treated to the long-awaited sequel, Silksong, which was revealed a mere two weeks before release. But, as with anything, we’re always thirsty for more. And today, Team Cherry announced what’s next for its pair of games. First up is news of Silksong’s initial wave of downloadable content. This nautically themed expansion promises to deliver new areas, bosses, tools, and more when it hits consoles and Steam in 2026. Although no specific release date was revealed, with 2026 just around the corner, we don’t expect a long wait. The best part? The content comes to all players free of charge. The team promises to reveal more info shortly before Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow releases, so stay tuned for further details. In the meantime, you can view the Sea of Sorrows teaser below for a taste of what’s to come. Next up is news on the original Hollow Knight, which the team affectionately refers to as Silksong’s sibling. Not content to rest even eight years later, Hollow Knight is being primed for a Switch 2 Edition. This will come as a free upgrade for owners of the existing Switch title, bringing updated framerates, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects. The game looked terrific to being with, though Silksong on Switch 2 is simply subline. We can’t wait to see Hollow Knight in all its HD glory when it hits Switch 2 in 2026. The announcements come on the heels of Silksong’s success, with the team stating that the sequel has sold over seven million copies since releasing in September. The team’s message of thanks was heartwarming in itself. It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further. What do you think of this news? Are you a fan of Hollow Knight and its sequel? Let us know if you’re excited about Team Cherry’s 2026 announcements! We’ll be sure to give our thoughts on the next episode of the Pure Nintendo Podcast.

Review: Adventure of Samsara (Nintendo Switch),"Adventure of Samsara is a 2D action-adventure title developed by Ilex Games and published by Atari. That last part is important because this game is purported to be an ode to the classic Atari title Adventure. It also seems to pay homage to the likes of Prince of Persia with its parkour elements. It takes these retro inspirations and adds a modern spin, providing a metroidvania that manages to balance a concurrent feeling of classic and new. In Adventure of Samsara, you play the role of the Solar Champion, a long-dead hero who’s been resurrected by the light of the Sun. What that actually translates to is that the world has been overrun by undead creatures, and you’ve been brought back to life to defeat them. Things begin rather slowly, with a few simple levels designed to bring you up to speed with the controls and environment. This introduction is definitely slow-paced, but it does open into something much deeper the more you play. In other words, be sure to persist past the initial offering. Apart from the usual running and jumping, it soon becomes clear that our hero has other moves at his disposal. For example, he can dash through enemies, which allows you to avoid attacks and retaliate from behind. This satisfying move is accompanied by magical abilities and upgradeable weapons. New abilities allow you to open new pathways and areas; the sprawling map expands, and the game continues. While there are a lot of metroidvanias out there, Adventure of Samsara certainly fits the bill, and uses those genre elements well. Our hero feels quite solid, with a heaviness to his jumps. In other words, he’s not a nimble platformer. Coming to this from something like Hollow Knight can feel jarring at first, but I actually appreciate the sense of weight to this character’s presence; he’s portrayed as a large Viking-type warrior, wielding large, presumably heavy, weapons. This translates well in the gameplay. And, thankfully, our hero sports the ability to climb cliffs with a whip-like move. This weight can also be perceived as clunkiness. Some enemy encounters can border on frustrating due to the lack of quick movesets. It’s easy to be hit by projectiles or flying enemies, for example, and be knocked off balance – or even off a cliff. Thankfully, the more you practise, the easier it becomes, and there is satisfaction in learning the ropes. Graphically, Adventure of Samasara wears its retro inspirations on its sleeve with deliberately pixelated sprites. It adds its own unique flavor by adding lovely backgrounds to some areas, like a giant moon. There are also foreground elements like falling snowflakes that help bring this world to life. It balances its old-school look with some more modern touches to create a nice atmosphere. The soundtrack emits subtle tunes during most of the gameplay, with stronger atmospheric tunes ramped up during boss fights. It generally suits the environment, though it’s perhaps not the most memorable score I’ve heard. Speaking of boss fights, these epic battles are also present and accounted for, as you would expect with any decent metroidvania. The battles begin with a cutscene, again adding a modern twist to the retro style, along with some tough battles. Patience is key (another metroidvania staple), so be prepared to keep at it. Overall, Adventure of Samsara is a true metroidvania. Sprawling maps, tricky combat, collectibles and upgrades; it has it all. Although things start slowly, it’s worth progressing past the initial intro to discover the deeper gameplay elements.

Review: Let’s Sing 2026 (Nintendo Switch),"Let’s Sing 2026 feels like it should be a safe bet for karaoke fans. The series has been around long enough to know what works; a modern song list and an array of party-friendly modes for group sessions. Unfortunately, while the core concept still shines, the actual experience on Nintendo Switch is weighed down by technical problems and frustrating barriers that make simply playing the game harder than it ever should be. The most immediate issue is connectivity. Let’s Sing 2026 heavily pushes the Let’s Sing Companion App as the primary way to play without traditional microphones, but in reality, it’s pretty unreliable. During my time with the game, microphones repeatedly disconnected mid-session, and the pairing code needed to connect phones occasionally wouldn’t load at all. When that happens, the game becomes completely unplayable unless you happen to own a USB microphone, something that’s surprisingly difficult to find locally these days unless you’re willing to order one online and wait. My wife and I actually went to three different stores, including a used game store to see if we could find one, but no luck. Even when you get past the microphone hurdles, the problems don’t stop. The game advertises a free trial DLC code that unlocks the full song library for a limited time. In my case, that code simply didn’t work. After checking online, it became clear this wasn’t an isolated issue. Other players reported the same problem. I created a QuickSilver account through the game (an affiliated service), received a replacement trial code, and successfully redeemed it. The download completed… yet the game still claimed the content wasn’t installed and refused to unlock the full experience. At that point, the only mode available was the basic free-for-all sing mode, which lets you choose a song and perform, but blocks access to several other features. To properly review the game at all, I ended up paying $4 for a 30-day VIP pass through the Nintendo eShop, despite the fact that the free trial was supposed to cover that. It’s not the price that’s the issue, it’s the principle. A game designed for casual, party friendly fun should not require this many hoops just to access what was already advertised. In terms of content, the base game offers a small set of built-in songs, which makes the DLC feel less like a bonus and more like a requirement. Once the VIP songs are factored in, the overall library becomes much more substantial, but access to that larger catalog is entirely dependent on whether the DLC actually works as intended. When Let’s Sing 2026 works, it’s easy to see why the series has a following. The song selection is solid, the visuals are colorful, and karaoke fans, like my wife, who was genuinely excited to play, can absolutely have fun once everything is running properly. But the overall experience left a sour taste. Between app instability, DLC activation failures, and accessibility issues, the setup process actively detracts from what should be a relaxed, joyful game night. Ultimately, Let’s Sing 2026 isn’t a bad karaoke game…it’s a frustrating one. If you already own compatible microphones (USB, no Bluetooth) and are willing to navigate technical issues, there’s fun to be found here. But for anyone expecting a smooth experience, be prepared for technical roadblocks that may dampen the excitement before the first song even begins.

Review: Call of the Sea (Nintendo Switch 2),"Call of the Sea is a first-person adventure game developed by Out of the Blue Games and published by Raw Fury. It’s a mystery filled with wonder, puzzles, and some story moments that will have you holding your breath. The story is set in 1934 and you play as Norah, a woman heading off on her own to find her missing husband. She has a mysterious illness and her husband had set out on an expedition to find her the cure. When his letters abruptly stop, Norah takes matters into her own hands to find him. Or, at least figure out what happened to him. She finds herself alone, on a sketchy island in the South Pacific, The captain that brings her there tells her he’ll pick her up in three days. Thus, the adventure begins. Don’t worry; Call of the Sea isn’t actually timed. The game moves forward once you’ve done everything you need to in the current area. This is nice considering you can take your time and explore every nook and cranny, but it also means you might be stuck in a specific spot for a long time if you can’t figure out what to do next. Norah keeps a journal so clues and evidence you find (that are important) will be noted there, and you can look at it any time. The mysteries of the island, Norah’s illness, and the disappearance of her husband (and his exploration crew) are revealed slowly through environmental and found narrative. Norah narrates a lot . Sometimes to the point where she’ll overexplain something. She’ll speak while you play, so it was somewhat difficult to focus on exploring or solving a puzzle because I tuned into what she was saying, just in case it was something important. It was jarring at times, but not anything big enough to make me want to quit the game. The puzzles are a huge portion of Call of the Sea. I’ll begin by saying puzzle games aren’t my strong suit despite telling myself otherwise whenever I boot up a puzzle game. Within the first few puzzles, I’m always humbled. The puzzles in this game were somewhat tricky and that was partially on my lack of puzzle-solving skills, but also partly the game. Let me explain: I knew what to do for many of the puzzles, but the solution itself wasn’t clear because I played differently than how the game wanted me to. For example, one early puzzle had a totem of five symbols that needed reordering. First, I tried the order I found the symbols in. Nothing. I tried many combinations and nothing worked. I ended up looking at a walkthrough to find the solution and it turned out I was correct. I needed to organize the symbols in the order I found them throughout the island. The problem was, I found the symbols in a different order than the game wanted me to. The symbol I was supposed to find first, I found last. That’s how many of the puzzles are. That said, I wasn’t too impressed with most of the puzzles in Call of the Sea. I believe the narrative and exploration is its strong suit, despite Norah talking so much. The opening cutscene felt like I was watching an (interactive) movie and it was wonderful. The game is broken up into six chapters, which are all relatively short depending on how quick you can solve the puzzles. Each area really only has a handful of smaller puzzles plus one big one to solve before moving on. Otherwise, the majority of the game is walking around and clicking on everything you find to learn more about the island, and what previously happened there. Having the game in first-person was too much, though that’s a personal preference. I couldn’t play for too long without getting dizzy since you’re moving the cursor all over the screen to look and click on everything possible. The cursor is a small dot in the middle of the screen, and I needed to be absolutely precise in where I clicked or else Norah wouldn’t notice anything. Chapter three in particular was rough to get through because Norah is stranded on the beach at night during a thunderstorm. I’m sensitive to lights and always play my games with the brightness all the way down, but I needed it up for chapter three. But even with my brightness at 100%, it was difficult to see and the bright flashes of lightning every so often gave me a headache. These aren’t necessarily negatives, but with such an enticing storyline, I would have loved to sit down and play Call of the Sea for a couple hours at a time. Unfortunately, I was only able to play in short bursts because of the POV and the lighting. Otherwise, there are many features to love about this game. The music and sound effects brought the island to life. Plus, the game is fully voice acted, which was top-notch. The story kept me on my toes, between Norah’s missing husband, her illness, and the creepiness of the island. However, I think the puzzles could have been done a bit better.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is Hideo Kojima’s “Masterpiece” Because it’s His Latest Game,"In a new video courtesy of Wired, Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima has referred to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach as his “masterpiece”. In the video, where he answers questions asked by fans of his works, Kojima clarified that he always looks at the most recent project he worked on as his best one so far. When asked “what do you consider your masterpiece,” Kojima responded by saying that he gets asked this question a lot, and “my latest work is my masterpiece. So that would be Death Stranding 2.” Throughout the video, he also went into more detail about various aspects of game development, including how he sees the interactivity offered by video games as a medium being its most important and interesting aspect. For instance, he is asked what makes a game “good” for him. To this he responds by noting that, along with the love of its creator, a game is often good based on how well it uses its interactivity. “First, the creator’s love,” said Kojima. “That’s key. Also, since it is interactive, say there’s an item with one intended use. But it doesn’t end there. The player thinks ‘Maybe I can use it this way too?’ and tries it out. It works, and they think, ‘Oh, cool!’ Then they try another way, and realize that’s prepared too. It’s about that level of freedom. The player discovers things for themselves, and finds those mechanics.” This answer is in turn summarized as: “You have to feel the creator’s love. A great game offers a high level of freedom, allowing players to discover their own unique ways to utilize items.” Another question asked by a hobbyist game developer revolves around how the developer can make a game that “never gets old, one you want to replay after completing it,” to which Kojima responds by noting that the important aspects of a game aren’t just their stories, but also their worlds, controls, and immersion. “You want to be there,” he explained. “It’s about making you want to stay and play. Say you stop playing for the night. You go to school or work. The key is wanting to return to that world. Making the player want to dive back in is crucial for games. There’s a unique world inside that space, where you can be different from your ordinary self. It lets you do things you can’t do in real life. That’s vital.” In the same Q&A video, Kojima had also spoken about what kinds of projects he would like to work on in the future . When asked about new genres he wanted to take on, Kojima responded by saying that “I want to pioneer a new genre, so I don’t focus much on existing ones.” This project, according to Kojima, would be based on “maybe hard sci-fi,” because “I love space settings, so I’d like to try that. I’m also a fan of Westerns, so maybe that. Or a period piece, but those exist already.” After having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach earlier this year, Kojima’s studio—Kojima Productions—is currently working on two projects: horror title OD and espionage game Physint . In the meantime, check out our review of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach , which is currently only available on PS5.",2025-12-24T12:55:40+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-hideo-kojimas-masterpiece-because-its-his-latest-game
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Director Explains How Studio Experimented With AI But Didn’t Like It,"In light of recent controversies surrounding Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 having gotten its Indie Game Awards wins revoked due to its undisclosed use of generative AI, director Guillaume Brioche has now confirmed just how developer Sandfall Interactive had experimented with using the technology when the RPG was being made. In a Q&A session with YouTuber Sushi (which you can check out below), Broche spoke about how everything we can see in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is human-made. However, generative AI coming out in 2022 led to the studio experimenting with the technology as a potential tool. “Yeah, we’re aware of what’s been going on with [ Divinity director Swen Vincke’s statements about AI use ],” explained Broche in response to a question about the studio’s use of generative AI and how it will be used in the future. “But I can say, everything in the game is human made. When AI first really came out in 2022, we’d already started on the game. It was just a new tool, we tried it, and we didn’t like it at all. It felt wrong. We had originally used it as a placeholder for textures we missed, but we took it out as soon as we found it.” “But yeah, the concept art, voice actors, everything is human made. It’s pretty hard what the future [of the industry] will look like, but everything will be made by humans from us.” Broche was referring to Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke’s statements about the use of generative AI at the studio from earlier this month. His statements about how generative AI was being used to “explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text,” drew quite a bit of controversy among fans of Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 , who noted that using it in concept art would taint the rest of the art that was built on top for the game. This criticism had prompted Vincke to issue another statement later where he spoke about how the tools were working as “additive” to the talents of the creative teams rather than generative AI serving as replacements to artists themselves. “We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse,” said Vincke. The use of generative AI in the gaming industry has been a hot-button issue for a while, but discussions have largely picked up over the previous month, with Warhorse Studios’ Daniel Vávra writing his own lengthy statement about how the world should stop resisting the rise and proliferation of generative AI. In his statement, he noted that “AI is here to stay with us.” “As frightening as it may be, that’s the way it is,” he continued. “Personally, it scares me the most in the music because you can’t even recognise AI there anymore.” Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima also spoke about AI, and how we can’t go back to a world without it, comparing the technology to smartphones .",2025-12-24T12:25:21+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-explains-how-studio-experimented-with-ai-but-didnt-like-it
"Squadron 42 is Now Fully Playable, Will be Over 40 Hours in Length","With 2025 coming to an end, Star Citizen and Squadron 42 developer Cloud Imperium Games has provided an update on the development of both titles through a new Letter From the Chairman post by creator Chris Roberts. In his post, Roberts reflected on the number of updates that were made to the alpha builds of Star Citizen throughout the year, while also confirming that all chapters of Squadron 42 are now playable. Roberts also noted that Squadron 42 measures in at over 40 hours in length, and that the developers are now working on “remaining polish, optimization, and bug fixing.” He also wrote about how Cloud Imperium Games had worked throughout 2025 to build on the development progress it had made on Squadron 42 back in 2024, with a focus on “bringing the game to content complete and closing out remaining core tasks in preparation for Beta.” “A big part of what makes this possible is the technology we’ve built at CIG over many years,” wrote Roberts. “The ability to move seamlessly from on foot, into a vehicle you can fly and move around inside, down to a planet or across star systems, all without loading screens, creates a level of immersion that’s very difficult to replicate. That combination of close-up interaction and galactic scale is at the core of what will make Squadron 42 so unique.” “Equally important is the quality of the content itself. From writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design, the level of care across the entire game is something I’m incredibly proud of. Combined with deeply interactive systems, it creates an experience that pulls you into the world and keeps you there.” As for Star Citizen , Roberts also wrote about a recently-released experimental update released for the game’s Alpha 4.5 build which brings in support for VR headsets. He noted that this “Christmas Surprise” originally started as a passion project and started getting the attention of developers as well as fans of Star Citizen . As part of this VR mode, “almost everything” has been physicalized, which means that it can be interacted with by players with their own hands regardless of whether they are playing in first or third-person views. The VR mode, he noted, also helps further justify the work that Cloud Imperium Games has put into detailing its various environments, props, ships and gear, since players can now experience these things at true scale. The VR mode is still considered “an early and experimental step,” however, and the developers are still working on more ways to improve it. Looking to the future, the studio plans on bringing in a number of improvements to the technology it has already introduced to Star Citizen and Squadron 42 . Among these making Server Meshing—first introduced to Star Citizen through an update earlier this year , allowing the server meshes to automatically reconfigure themselves in real-time based on player activity and server load. There will also be more in-game content introduced over the next year to Star Citizen ’s alpha. Squadron 42 , on the other hand, is currently moving towards its Beta release. However, Cloud Imperium Games hasn’t confirmed when this Beta release is slated to happen.",2025-12-24T11:33:37+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/squadron-42-is-now-fully-playable-will-be-40-hours-in-length
The Witcher 3 to Get New DLC in May 2026 as Lead Up to The Witcher 4’s 2027 Release – Analyst,"While CD Projekt RED has been working on The Witcher 4 , and Fool’s Theory is working on a remake of the original The Witcher , analysts believe that the two studios are also working together for a brand new DLC for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt . According to Polish publication Strefa Inwestorów , Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski is predicting a major new DLC that would bridge the gap between the story of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and The Witcher 4 will be coming out in May 2026. Chrzanowski’s predictions indicate that the DLC will be priced at $30, and that it will come to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt —which originally came out on PC, PS4 and Xbox One all the way back on May 18, 2015. This DLC is also expected to properly kick off the marketing push for The Witcher 4 , which is expected to come out in late 2027. It is worth noting that the two major DLCs released for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine —have already wrapped up the majority of the story arc for protagonist Geralt of Rivia. With that in mind, as well as the fact that The Witcher 4 will feature a brand new protagonist in the form of Geralt’s adopted daughter Ciri, this rumoured DLC will likely give us a deeper glimpse at her story, including the kind of training she goes through to become the hardened witcher we saw in the reveal trailer for The Witcher 4 . Fool’s Theory is rumoured to be taking lead on the development of this DLC, since the studio also has several developers that have previously worked on games in The Witcher franchise in the past. CD Projekt RED itself is yet to make any announcement or offer any confirmation about this DLC, however. As for the remake of the original The Witcher , CD Projekt RED has confirmed that it is slated for release some time after the release of Polaris —the studio’s internal codename for The Witcher 4 . In an earnings call, president and joint CEO of CD Projekt Group Adam Kiciński spoke about how the remake will make use of Unreal Engine 5-based technology that was also used in The Witcher 4 . “Coming back to The Witcher Remake and when it will come,” said Kiciński. “Yes, it will come after Polaris , which is a consequence of how we think about this project. I think The Witcher Remake will be based in big part on technologies from Polaris , so it will be developed partially in parallel to Polaris . But once Polaris is launched, everything for Polaris will be then in the final shape, and it will be partially reused in the remake.” Fool’s Theory CEO Jakub Rokosz has also spoken about the studio’s work on The Witcher remake back in January 2024, where he noted that the studio will be taking out parts of the original title that are considered bad, outdated or “unnecessarily convoluted” by modern gaming standards .",2025-12-24T11:08:42+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/the-witcher-3-to-get-new-dlc-in-may-2026-as-lead-up-to-the-witcher-4s-release-in-2027-analyst
"007 First Light Delayed to May 27th, 2026","Grand Theft Auto 6 has some company in the delay department as IO Interactive has announced it’s pushing back the release of 007 First Light . Don’t worry, though – the action-adventure title will now be releasing two months later on May 27th, 2026. In a Bluesky post, studio CEO Hakan Abrak revealed that the project is “fully playable from beginning to end,” and that the additional time “will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch.” As the company’s “most ambitious project to date” with far more systems than its Hitman franchise , Abrak also feels that the decision “allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.” Of course, there will be more updates on the title early next year, so stay tuned for that. Besides, with Crimson Desert, Replaced, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection and more launching in the same month, shifting to a less busy month could pan out better. Unless other big games are announced for the same time, that is. 007 First Light is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Check out the latest trailer , which showcases Lenny Kravitz as Bawma, one of the antagonists.

Ubisoft Working With Nintendo to Improve VRR Support in More Games,"While it’s no secret that Ubisoft has maintained a close relationship with Nintendo over the years, going as far as making exclusive games for the latter’s consoles, in a new interview, the company has revealed that it is helping Nintendo with improving support for variable refresh rate (VRR) across other games on the Switch 2. While Ubisoft had already spoken about how it achieved VRR support in the Switch 2 version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows , the studio went into more detail with FRVR about the techniques used, including a dedicated algorithm. Ubisoft noted that “both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws use a similar technique to take advantage of Switch 2’s Variable Refresh Rate, even below 40Hz”. “Since Shadows targets 30fps, and the console’s VRR currently only works at 40Hz or higher, we use a clever workaround,” explained the company. “The same frame is effectively presented twice, once in the middle of the frame and again at the end, so the hardware outputs at a 60Hz interval while maintaining smooth visuals”. Ubisoft went on to confirm that this same technology that allows its titles to support VRR on the Switch 2 is now part of the company’s in-house Anvil Engine, which powers all of the company’s modern games. This means that it can also be used for future titles, including the rumoured upcoming Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag Resynced , which will likely also make its way to the Switch 2. Along with this, Ubisoft is “continuing to work with Nintendo to improve VRR support going forward.” While Ubisoft has already released both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws on the Nintendo Switch 2 , it is currently unknown whether the company will bring its other major title— Rainbow Six Siege X —to the platform. Speaking about this, creative director Alexander Karpazis had noted back in October that it wasn’t currently focusing on bringing the competitive shooter to more platforms. However, he also said that it doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t come to Nintendo’s console, using the adage “never say never” . “For us, the focus will always be on the platforms we’re on right now, making sure that it’s the best experience, and when we do new gameplay [that] it makes use of the platforms that we’re on. So right now, any new platform isn’t necessarily a focus for us. But again, we’re a live game, it’s 10 years. I learnt a long time ago to never say never, so we’ll see as platforms grow and new opportunities come up too,” he said in an interview. As for Assassin’s Creed Shadows , Ubisoft revealed in its recent earnings report last month that the open-world action adventure title has been overperforming . In its earnings report, the company noted that the title benefitted from post-launch updates, including the free update that brought in New Game+, as well as the release of the Claws of Awaji expansion. The Assassin’s Creed franchise as a whole has also managed to generate “211 million session days,” which Ubisoft noted was 35 percent higher than the average from the last few years.",2025-12-23T13:24:15+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-will-work-with-nintendo-to-improve-vrr-support-in-more-games
"Grand Theft Auto 6 Will Not See Another Delay At Risk of Losing Hype, Says Former Animator","While Rockstar Games has already had to delay the highly-anticipated title Grand Theft Auto 6 , former animator for the studio, Mike York doesn’t believe that the game will face any more delays. Speaking to Esports Insider (via Dexerto ), York noted that the currently-planned November 19, 2026 release date for Grand Theft Auto 6 is a good time for the game to come out thanks to it being just a month before Christmas, which tends to be a popular time for shopping. “I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas,” said York. “Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time.” As for the reasons behind the delay— Grand Theft Auto 6 was originally planned for release in May 20260—York believes that the studio has been hard at work to ensure that the game is as good as it possibly can be. This includes the need for polish as well, since the studio also has quite a bit on the line in terms of its reputation and potential revenue. “If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be,” he said. “They’re polishing stuff. I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.” At this point, York also doesn’t think there will be any more delays for the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 . According to him, this largely comes down to the current hype behind the game. However, constant delays will likely end up with people having stopped caring about the game. “If Rockstar Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6 ,” said York. “Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.” “People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it,” he continued. “They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’” While there has undoubtedly been plenty of hype behind Grand Theft Auto 6 , developer Rockstar Games has also recently come under fire for having fired more than 30 of its employees for what it called “gross misconduct.” The employees themselves, along with the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) have been protesting the company, calling its acts union busting .",2025-12-23T12:37:02+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-not-see-another-delay-at-risk-of-losing-hype-says-former-animator
Doom Co-Creator’s New Game Will be Great For Fans of Classic id Software Shooters – Rumour,"While Romero Games’ at-risk shooter has seemingly been rescued from being scrapped, few details have been officially revealed about the title so far. A new report, courtesy of Insider Gaming, however, reveals quite a bit of information, including the fact that it was originally going to be titled Hellslayer , and would have several inspirations from games like Hotline Miami in terms of its mechanics. In a new episode of the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast, Mike Straw has revealed that the title would involve players taking on the role of a priest that is fighting demons. “The new game is not what was [being made] in a partnership with Microsoft,” said Straw. “That game is gone, but they’re taking elements from it.” He went on to discuss the fact that the original version of the game was titled Hellslayer . “It was a first-person shooter inspired by Hotline Miami , meaning that if you die and would just come to life right away,” he continued. While Straw wasn’t able to reveal what elements of this older title were being carried over into the new game, he expressed quite a bit of enthusiasm about what he has learned, especially for players that are already fans of classic id Software titles like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D . As for why only parts of the original iteration of the game are being brought over into the new title, Straw speculated that it likely came down to the developers taking the time to see what they had and making a decision to narrow down the scope of the game. Doom co-creator John Romero himself had confirmed that this shooter project had been saved after having gone through some major changes. In a discussion at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid earlier this month, Romero said that the title had “been basically completely redesigned,” while also noting that it “incorporates a lot of the elements” from the original incarnation of the game. “We’re not starting at ground zero,” explained Romero. “We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.” As part of this redesign, Romero has also confirmed that the scope had been changed, making the newer incarnation of the title a “much smaller game” than what it used to be. This, he noted, also had the added benefit of revitalising the development team. He said, “the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn’t actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that”. “[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that’s why small teams are great,” he continued. Romero had confirmed that this project had been saved a few months after Romero Games CEO Brenda Romero had announced its cancellation from investors having pulled out . At the time, development on the game was noted as going quite well, with the studio being able to hit all required milestones.",2025-12-23T12:00:00+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/doom-co-creators-new-game-will-be-great-for-fans-of-classic-id-software-shooters-rumour
EA’s Board Approves $55 Billion Acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s PIF and Other Investors,"The planned acquisition of EA by a consortium of investors made up of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Affinity Partners and Silver Lake Partners has now been approved by EA’s shareholders. As caught by Stephen Totilo, the deal is valued at around $55 billion, and the next major step for this acquisition will be for all of the companies involved to get approval from the appropriate government regulatory bodies. “As of 2:03pm PT, EA’s shareholders have officially approved EA’s $55 billion sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund,” confirmed Totilo on social media. “The deal will next need to receive approval from government regulators.” The deal was originally announced all the way back in September, and involves a complete buyout of EA that will make the company a privately-owned one. As part of the deal, the current shareholders of EA will be paid $210 per share in cash, which is noted as being a premium of 25 percent over EA’s share price as of the market closing on September 25, 2025, when each share was priced at $168.32. “Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said EA CEO and chairman Andrew Wilson in a statement announcing the deal. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.” According to a more recent report, the deal will end up with Saudi Arabia’s PIF owning 93.4 percent of EA . Silver Lake Partners and Affinity Partners will end up with ownership of 5.5 percent and 1.1 percent of the company respectively. Before this acquisition, the PIF already had a 9.9 percent stake on EA. “This investment embodies Silver Lake’s mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” said Silver Lake co-CEO and managing partner Egon Durban.. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.” Proceedings surrounding the acquisition are expected to get completed in Q1 FY2027, and will result in the company’s shares no longer being listed on any stock exchange. Wilson will also continue in his role as EA’s CEO, with the company’s headquarters continuing to be based out of Redwood City, California.

Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault,"Moonlighter was an odd little game. Released back in 2019 by 11 Bit Studios, the first game was a strange little duck hybrid of running a shop and dungeon crawling, with an interesting gameplay loop. The game was a decent experience, if a little bland. When Digital Sun announced they were making the sequel, I was excited. Digital Sun is a pretty cool studio, and I adored their last game, Cataclismo. It was a grimdark mix of basebuilding and RTS with a dark story that I really enjoyed, and they have taken their experience to good effect with Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault. I was surprised by the long gap between the games, but I am glad to see Moonlighter 2 is finally out. Big thanks to 11 Bit Studios for the review code, by the way! The game is out in Early Access right now, with a decent amount of content at launch and a solid framework to start with. It has had some teething troubles, but I have been enjoying myself with this one so far. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault continues the adventure of the first game, but with some critical changes. This time, the art style is fully 3D and presented in an isometric perspective. You step into the shoes of Will, the shopkeeper-adventurer, starting anew in a strange dimension within the village of Tresna. There’s some pretty funny dialogue and interesting story beats here, with Will effectively being treated as a servant by their big orc shopkeeper boss. Things escalate into a ‘save the world’ kinda thing, which won’t win any originality prizes, but the beats are decent. So far, so good. When not running the shop, you delve into shifting, roguelike dungeons across ever-changing dimensions in search of relics and treasure. The combat and exploration feature roguelike elements, requiring you to adapt to new dungeon layouts and foes using a variety of weapons and tactics. That loot carries into the shop mechanics during the day, in which you price items that were salvaged during the dives. Why only one random jock can do this is anyone’s guess, but it’s a good enough excuse. Money earned goes into new equipment for you and helps to rebuild the village. More dungeon crawlers could benefit from this management system, like a shop, and Moonlighter 2 definitely feels more refined than the original. I think the combat and loot systems are much stronger than in the first, with more varied dungeons, more interesting combat, and a wider range of systems. The gameplay is fairly satisfying despite the early access build. I am a fan of the combat, and exploring the dungeons is more exciting than it was in the original. It is now more dynamic, featuring a variety of weapons and perks that add depth beyond simple attack mechanics. Roguelike-style perks, relic modifiers, and inventory management keep things fresh. Despite the early access model and the content being incomplete, there is a fair amount of playtime here, including multiple biomes, over 120 relics to discover, various shop and dungeon perks to unlock, and customization options for your shop and town. Moonlighter 2 does have some issues. I’ve had a lot of performance problems. Even on higher-end systems, I’ve had crashes and slowdowns, especially during combat. I also had some horrendous issues with the Steam Deck at launch, though patches have improved it slightly. While I’m enjoying the overall story, they feel somewhat lacking, and some promised features, such as shop customization, deeper NPC interactions, and more variety in dungeons or bosses, feel a little underdeveloped right now. Early Access exists for a reason, and I am confident these things will be addressed, but it is essential to note. Overall, I’m enjoying my time with Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault , and I’m excited to see where it goes.",2025-12-01T09:00:00+00:00,TheThousandScar,https://sassygamers.com/feed,https://sassygamers.com/2025/12/01/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault
Scar Tries SWAPMEAT: A Refreshing FPS!,"We’re back! We’ve had snow this week, and the cold snap is rather irritating when you have a long commute to work. The Game of the Year discourse continues to be entertaining, and I find it funny how seriously people take it. As always, we are back with the video games, and today’s review features SWAPMEAT, a colorful roguelite shooter that’s been enjoying a fairly solid reception. It is one of those games I hope gets more attention, and while it’s in early access with a long way to go, it has a solid core that nails one of the main reasons we play video games. We play them for fun, and SWAPMEAT is oodles of that, wrapped in an artistic style that drips with character. It’s not perfect, of course, but I am enjoying myself with this one so far. SWAPMEAT has some interesting mechanics that set it apart from the torrent of roguelikes and ‘boomer shooters’ on the market, making it more engaging for players interested in innovative gameplay. I make a lot of jokes about how the indie market has its own version of the ‘AAA Open World’ model, and that’s usually the roguelike and deckbuilder genres. Regardless, I appreciate what SWAPMEAT has on offer. In this galactic adventure, players can take on body parts from the monsters they butcher, swapping out fleshy appendages for different bonuses. That is a creative way of powering yourself up. Most games offer dull methods like picking up the weapons of the fallen to bolster yourself in the big fight for survival. Pulling off somebody’s arm and wielding it as a weapon against the poor corpse’s mates sounds disturbing and hilarious, and it is how I prefer to do things. SWAPMEAT comes with a decent amount of content for its alpha Early Access build, featuring a partially complete campaign, several difficulty levels, co-op multiplayer, and random solar systems to run through after finishing the campaign. I quite like how the devs are approaching this one, providing a solid core of progression and gameplay systems, a tasty campaign, and promising replayability that hints at more content to come, keeping players’ interest alive for future updates. I’ve been having fun with this one so far, with both the visual design and core gameplay loop keeping me engaged. I do sometimes wonder, though, about the value of playing story campaigns while they are incomplete during Early Access. It usually means having to replay everything when it’s complete and polished for full release, which can lead to a rough first impression. Besides that quibble of mine and a few weird bugs, however, SWAPMEAT is living up to my expectations. The price tag of $24.99 is relatively high for an indie game in Early Access, especially a FPS, but the combination of content and decent polish makes it a fair value. As with all Early Access games, though, I would purchase based on what is available now rather than what is planned, because anything can happen in this industry. This approach helps readers make informed choices and manage expectations. Regardless, however, I do recommend the game for its sheer creativity alone, which is evident even in its current state.",2025-11-25T09:00:00+00:00,TheThousandScar,https://sassygamers.com/feed,https://sassygamers.com/2025/11/25/scar-tries-swapmeat-a-refreshing-fps/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-swapmeat-a-refreshing-fps
Scar Tries Sand: A Superfluous Game,"We’re back, and it’s mid-November! Things feel rather wintry here in the UK right now, and I’m currently huddled in a blanket typing out my thoughts for today’s games. It is pretty chilly out there, which is reminding me that I’m becoming an old man. At least we still have games, and the Game of the Year discussions are always interesting. I’m featuring just one game today while I juggle some projects. That game is Sand, A Superfluous Game that popped up on my radar. It is a fairly quirky little game, and it has been keeping my attention over the past weeks. As always, all opinions are my own, and these reviews should be considered as a first impression of the game. Launching in September this year, Sand is a surprisingly low-key experience despite the depth it offers. Developed by Voided Pixels Studio, Sand has some interesting mechanics that help it stand out, and the game deserves more attention. At its heart, Sand is an open-world game that blends base-building, exploration, and survival in a pleasant top-down art style, and there’s a surprising amount of lore in this world. Set in a post-apocalyptic version of Alaska, centuries after a catastrophic event, humanity is struggling to survive. The setting is pretty creative, blending undead, cosmic horror, and mutant monsters. It’s almost like someone took Rimworld, classic Fallout, and Cataclysm, put them in a white room, and told them to have a baby. And that sounds like something I’ll play, so let’s give it a try! It sounds like a hot mess, but there is a lot to like here. In this cheerful version of Alaska, the player finds a mysterious cube from space. Against this backdrop, you embark on a journey of building and survival while uncovering secrets and forming bizarre alliances. The game is played from a top-down perspective, allowing the player to control a single character while teaming up with AI companions for more challenging missions. The classic gameplay loop feels solid and comfortable for anyone familiar with these kinds of games. You must craft and manage your base from a ruin into a new bastion for humanity, researching new technologies, managing resources, and venturing deeper into the wasteland. The cosmic horror and fantasy elements are pretty cool too, and you gain access to mysterious “Sand Powers” such as Sand Wall, Rock Throw, and Glass Blast. While death isn’t permanent with any roguelike mechanics (thank god), it comes with penalties. Exploration is encouraged, as venturing farther yields more resources, but also increases the risk of death. There are also some interesting survival mechanics, such as a reliance on water in travelling through the wasteland, so you’ve got to be very careful in how you approach exploration. This game isn’t easy. The visual style features pixel graphics in a top-down perspective, combining familiar indie aesthetics with a dystopian yet absurd tone. Think giant rhinos, space cubes, and llama racing. Additionally, despite its open-world and sandbox elements, the travel mechanics may feel restrictive compared to more fully open worlds. If you enjoy indie games with bold ideas and a mix of gameplay styles, and can appreciate a healthy dose of absurd humor, Sand: A Superfluous Game is a fresh and entertaining choice. It offers both mechanical depth and surprisingly engaging world-building. There is something truly special here, although I need to play more before I decide how much I feel about it. The price point is excellent for what you’re getting, and Sand offers a terrific deal for that.",2025-11-19T09:00:00+00:00,TheThousandScar,https://sassygamers.com/feed,https://sassygamers.com/2025/11/19/scar-tries-sand-a-superfluous-game/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-sand-a-superfluous-game
Scar Tries: Knights of the Crusades and Escape From Duckov,"It’s been a while! Happy Halloween to everyone who celebrates it. We had a pretty fun time, and I’ve had a busy few weeks. I visited the Lake District for a couple of days in early October, followed by a week of stomach issues. October has been one hell of a busy month for video games, from The Outer Worlds 2 to Arc Raiders, and things are somewhat chaotic! I am featuring two games today that I have been looking forward to for a while now, in Escape from Duckov and Knights of the Crusades. Let us begin! Knights of the Crusades Knights of the Crusades comes from Reverie World Studios, which has made several ambitious grand strategy games. I have found their titles a mixed bag overall. They brim with charm and some fascinating ideas, but the jank has often been a problem. Knights of the Crusades is their most interesting title to date, however, and while it does not quite escape the lack of polish with their other games, this is probably my favorite game from the studio so far. Set during the time of the First Crusade, this game blends RTS and citybuilding mechanics into an odd duck. There are some intriguing aspects at play, featuring an expansive set of campaigns and a sandbox mode to explore. As 4X games go, Knights of the Crusades offers something different with real-time citybuilding in short bursts, allowing a limited time for players to build settlements on the battle map. It is a nice mechanic, but a bit buggy. The game also features a real-time battle mechanic for sieges, where you construct weapons in real-time, gather resources, and mobilize troops in a twisted blend of Age of Empires and Total War. It is enjoyable enough. The usual management mechanics are in place between gathering resources, managing your army, and making sure you join the Crusades on time. The ideas are excellent, with some refreshing twists to the genre, although the game still needs some work, despite having left Early Access a few weeks ago. Optimization is a problem, and I found several crashes during the campaign map. Sometimes, save files would refuse to load, and the unit pathfinding in battles tended to get lost during sieges. The graphics feature some lovely environmental effects, especially in the campaign map, but I found the battle interface somewhat lacking. I would also like to see a separate battle or skirmish mode, because there is a lot of potential there. For its price tag, however, I feel Knights of the Crusades offers a somewhat refreshing alternative for strategy fans looking for something different. It’s rough around the edges and still needs some TLC, but it is ultimately greater than the sum of its parts. Escape from Duckov I have been growing fond of extraction shooters lately. While I never played Escape from Tarkov, I was a big fan of games like Zero Sievert and Witchfire. Arc Raiders launched very recently, and I haven’t picked it up yet, but I played the server tests and enjoyed what I saw. Escape from Duckov looks like the world’s biggest practical joke at first glance. Escape from Tarkov, but play as a small duck? Now that sounds like my cup of tea. This game has gone pretty viral with over two million copies sold and Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, which is damn impressive. After spending some time first with the playtest a while back and the launch version, I can see why the game is so popular. It might require some work, but a solo extraction shooter is still very rare, and Escape from Duckov oozes character. Being a single-player game, Duckov sets itself apart from the competition. After a short tutorial in which your heavily customised duck avatar is broken out of prison, the gameplay loop reveals itself. The game is played as a top-down shooter, where the ultimate goal is to eventually escape the island by building up resources while managing food and energy. Survival management is my go-to preference in games like this, and the frantic gameplay is sometimes at odds with the cartoony graphics Duckov offers. It is still surprisingly relaxing for all the brutal fighting curves. The maps randomize their loot for replayability, and the gameplay loop of scrounging supplies, exploration, and building facilities in the main base works as expected. The cute vibes and ducks running around, being goofy with each other, are hilarious, and it is just a solid loop. The grind can be challenging, and despite making things more approachable by making it a solo experience, the constant risk of losing everything in your inventory when you die makes it essential to be careful. While this is an early impressions review from me, Escape From Duckov is more than just a novelty mockery of a bigger game. Duckov is a competent extraction shooter in its own right, removing the multiplayer annoyances while maintaining the same great gameplay loop.",2025-11-01T08:00:00+00:00,TheThousandScar,https://sassygamers.com/feed,https://sassygamers.com/2025/11/01/scar-tries-knights-of-the-crusades-and-escape-from-duckov/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-knights-of-the-crusades-and-escape-from-duckov
Town to City Might Be The Best Citybuilder of 2025,"Town to City might be the best city builder this year. Now, that might sound boring, but I’ve come away incredibly impressed from this new indie game. It had a successful playable demo before the full launch, but you can still try the demo out before making the purchase. Despite the amount of time I’ve put into the game so far, I’m still treating this as an early impressions review. The game is out now in Early Access for $25, and there’s a solid core to work with at launch. While the game has that beta tag, this is a highly polished game with some exceptional quality control. I have had no bugs, crashes, or glitches through my 10 hours of gametime so far, and Town to City is one of those games that keeps on giving. Citybuilders have a fair bit of variety these days, ranging from cosy terrariums where all you need to do is fulfill your creative dreams without worry to brutal struggles where the slightest mistake will doom your colony to extinction. I’m looking at you, Frostpunk 2! Town to City is very much the former, favoring a gridless building system while keeping everything as relaxed as possible. You don’t have to worry about citizens dying from starvation, for instance, which is nice. There are requirements to meet to advance in technology, and citizens still need to be kept happy, but the consequences are less punishing than in other city builders. This is the perfect example of balancing a comfortable experience while still keeping in some challenge, and Town to City comes out of the gates swinging. There are happiness meters to meet with several ways to improve that. Between leisure, food, living space, and beauty, there are a lot of things to consider. With dozens of techs to unlock through research and six city levels to ascend, there is more content than you might expect for an Early Access city builder. I commend the visual design here because this is a gorgeous game. The graphics have a nice voxel vibe with some excellent lighting, and the game allows free camera movement around the map. One of my pet peeves in city builders is when the camera restricts you by zooming right into a bustling village, but in Town to City, you have complete control. Being able to pull the camera from all angles and view the little people as they go about their lives gave me god-game vibes from when I played Black and White 2. It has been a while since I played a city-builder that is this solid and charming out of the gate. There’s a polish in Town to City that few others have managed, and this is how you should do an Early Access game. All the bones are here, with plenty of content. It’s more a story of what to add to the game than refining the guts. The story maps have some solid writing as well, and if you really want to relax, the sandbox mode is already in the game for you if you wish to build without financial limits.",2025-09-22T10:00:00+00:00,TheThousandScar,https://sassygamers.com/feed,https://sassygamers.com/2025/09/22/town-to-city-might-be-the-best-citybuilder-of-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=town-to-city-might-be-the-best-citybuilder-of-2025
Scar Tries Noble Legacy,"It’s been a while since my last little review here, and I hope everyone is doing well! It’s been a strange couple of weeks over here, and I’ve been battling an annoying summer cold that makes it very annoying to get work done. That hasn’t stopped me playing new games of course, and I’m covering the incredibly ambitious citybuilder Noble Legacy today. I love ambitious games, even when they stumble more than others. Still, I will happily take that over the safe AAA games anyday, the ones that feel like they have come out of a printer. Games like Kenshi, Heart of the Machine, The Alters, and Chromosome Evil 2 get me more excited these days. Noble Legacy interested me months ago with its blend of 3rd person RPG, village life simulation, and citybuilding mechanics, and while it has a lot of rough edges, I can’t help but admire it. It’s important to note this is very early access, and a lot is up in the air about this game for now. I’d recommend holding off on it until we see more updates that improve the polish and early game. I tried the demo and was a bit underwhelmed, to the point where I was pretty concerned with how the launch would go. I had major technical problems like black screens, crashes to the desktop and some nasty stuttering, but the performance has improved in the launch version. The closest game to this I’d say is Medieval Dynasty, which I gradually warmed to after a rough start. Things kick off with a little cutscene when you and your annoying fellow noble friend arrive at a rather sad looking village that has seen better days and the gameplay loop reveals itself early. The visuals are quite nice although there is quite a lot of pop in with the terrain and environments, and the character animations have a tendency to bug out a little. All this added to the charm for me along with the voice acting, but the ambition seeps through everything here. You slowly build up the infrastructure of the village, seeing to your new servants/minions/smallfolk, and manage them. It’s decent enough with the guts of a classic survival building game, and despite all the rough edges, there’s enough gameplay to keep me engaged. The quests are the basic fetch quest affair but fortunately you can micromanage your little group of peasants for grunt work, which helps mitigate some of the grind. Despite the jank, there is a fair bit of content with this Early Access build, something that came as a surprise. Often with this genre, launch content is very thin with only a base toolset of the game’s mechanics and very little actual content. While Noble Legacy’s story mode is limited, the game also contains a free-build/sandbox mode to mess about with as an alternate game mode, which is nice to see. There’s a lot to like with Noble Legacy. While there is a lot of challenge with the survival mechanics, this is on the calmer end of the difficulty spectrum. The sandbox gameplay has plenty of room for experimentation, and I’m a big fan of the atmosphere. So far, there’s been a lot of patches to the game that’ve improved performance and some of the rougher bugs, but there’s still a lot of jank. Despite the rough edges with Noble Legacy, it’s one of the more interesting games I’ve played this year. For 25$, you can do a lot worse.",2025-09-06T08:00:00+00:00,TheThousandScar,https://sassygamers.com/feed,https://sassygamers.com/2025/09/06/scar-tries-noble-legacy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-noble-legacy
Bite Sized Reviews: Devil Spire Falls,"Devil Spire Falls is the sequel to one little indie game I adored back in the day. It was a lovely dungeon crawler roguelike that made a mockery of some competitors in the genre, and to this day the original Devil Spire is one of my favorite ‘just 10 minutes’ games when I don’t have much time. Devil Spire Falls takes on the original theme and dials the ambition up several notches. A procedurally generated open world RPG, I’m still baffled how on earth Ithrio Sumi pulls it off. Calling it just an RPG is putting it very lightly, as the amount of mechanics in Devil Spire Falls is immense, and far more than I can cover in just a single impressions review! The last time I saw an indie game this ambitious was Kenshi, another game where I questioned the sanity of the great minds behind it. Devil Spire Falls feels a lot like The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, only made by a single person. Let that sink in. How ridiculous is that? That doesn’t mean the game is flawless as it certainly isn’t. Anything with this much ambition will come with issues such as the procedural content being a mixed bag and some bugs, but I am incredibly impressed with what Ithrio Sumi has accomplished so far. The game starts you off in the unknown with very little to your name, and from that point the world is your oyster. While Devil Spire Falls does not hold the player’s hand, there is a ton of information in the options menu so you won’t get too overwhelmed. This is an impressive achievement for a game with so many hidden mechanics. At its heart, Devil Spire Falls is a dungeon crawler just like its father with a ton of different ways to tackle the challenges that it offers. The open world generates everything from towns to bandit camps, with NPCs to negotiate with or to murder, if the latter is something the player fancies. All of this is with an awesome, hellish atmosphere and despite the game’s simple graphics, The combat is usually something these kinds of ambitious games fumble, but Devil Spire’s combat system is solid. That didn’t surprise me because the first game had great combat too, but there’s a lot of strategy involved in fighting, and you have some interesting skills to fall upon if the bread and butter of normal melee fighting doesn’t appeal. It can feel a bit clunky at times and movement feels slow in the beginning, but that improves as your skills increase. As of this review, the game is in early access, which means you may encounter bugs and occasional crashes—something I expected. However, the developer is working tirelessly, releasing patches every week to fix numerous bugs, improve performance, and add new content. I’m excited about what this game will deliver. Given what it already offers, it’s incredibly impressive. I can’t wait to see what the final version 1.0 will be like; this game has the potential to become a classic.",2025-08-23T08:00:00+00:00,TheThousandScar,https://sassygamers.com/feed,https://sassygamers.com/2025/08/23/bite-sized-reviews-devil-spire-falls/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bite-sized-reviews-devil-spire-falls
Best AR Gun In BGMI For Complete Domination,"When it comes to versatile and powerful guns in Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), assault rifles reign supreme. With the ability to take down enemies at short to medium ranges, assault rifles are a must-have in your arsenal. But with the many options available, what is the best assault rifle for dominating your BGMI matches? After breaking down the stats and performance, here’s a list of ranking assault rifles in BGMI. 1. M416 – The All-Rounder The M416 has earned its reputation as one of the best all-around ARs in BGMI. This gun simply excels in nearly every category that matters. It packs a lethal combo of great stability, decent damage, and a pretty fast fire rate. The M416 is an absolute laser beam, able to take down enemies with ease at close and medium distances. The easy-to-control recoil also makes it a great option for newer players. Its versatility and consistency are why many pros favor the M416. Just watch out for burning through ammo quickly during sprays. But equip an extended mag, and the M416 will serve you well. AKM – The Heavy Hitter When you need raw stopping power, look no further than the AKM. This iconic assault rifle hits brutally hard, packing a mean punch with every shot. The AKM’s damage output is tremendous, able to rip enemies apart in just a few bullets. The tradeoff is a slower fire rate, but it makes up for it with its heavyweight damage. Recoil control can be tricky, but adding a comp and stock helps a lot. If you love aggressive run-and-gun gameplay, the AKM is a beastly AR to run with. Those deadly headshots are so satisfying! M762 – The Balanced Contender Lately, the M762 has become a fan-favorite AR in BGMI thanks to its well-rounded attributes. It brings a balanced blend of stability, damage, and a pretty quick fire rate. The M762 feels easy to control since the recoil pattern goes straight up. After the recent buffs, it can now compete head-to-head with the mighty M416. The only downside is that its overall DPS is slightly lower compared to others. But don’t let that fool you – the M762 still rips enemies apart fast. Just aim for those headshots when possible! So there you have it, my rankings for the best ARs to use currently in BGMI.

Multiplayer Gaming: An Influential System in the Modern World,"Have a look at how the multiplayer gaming system acts as a game changer for online games in contemporary society. Know the benefits of online gaming. Gaming has come a long way since the days of packing around oversized consoles and blowing into cartridges to get them to work. These days, gaming is a major form of entertainment and human connection thanks to the rise of online multiplayer gaming. While outsiders may see gaming as a mindless distraction for teens, some people do know it’s so much more than that. Gaming has huge social significance that people often overlook. Let’s look deep about some of the key benefits of online gaming that make it an important part of our modern world. Connecting People Across the Globe Online gaming gives people a way to instantly connect with others from around the world. It’s incredible that we can play matches of Call of Duty or League of Legends while teaming up with people from Europe, Asia, Australia – you name it. Gaming transcends country borders and physical limitations. All you need is an internet connection and a game console or PC. Smartphone Gaming Nowadays, multiplayer games are not limited to PCs. The advent of smartphone gaming has shifted the focus towards small devices as well. The advancement in technology has aided many big and small multiplayer games to develop largely. I-gaming along with big games have benefited from this. If you wish to play andar bahar online , it’s a matter of seconds to have the thrills right inside the palm of your hands. All you need to do is visit the website or app through your smartphone. Bonding and Teamwork Online multiplayer games heavily emphasize teamwork and communication. To succeed, you often need to strategize, cooperate, and coordinate with teammates towards a shared goal. This teaches invaluable soft skills like collaboration, active listening, planning, and adaptability. The thrill of victory when your squad syncs up is amazing. You create real camaraderie and bond through your shared mission. This social connection is key. Sportsmanship and Ethics While there’s definitely still toxic behavior, more and more gamers emphasize fair play and good sportsmanship. Saying “good game” or “GG” after a match is now standard practice. Being a gracious winner and respecting your opponents matters. There’s also been a culture shift in rejecting cheating and hacks in favor of competition through skill alone. Ethics are an important dimension many gamers now care about. It’s not just about winning at any cost, but elevating gaming itself. Lifelong Skills Many recent studies show online gaming helps develop useful real world skills like: Enhanced coordination and motor skills Quick reflexes and split second decision making Ability to process multiple streams of information simultaneously Improved visual scanning abilities Advanced strategic and planning capabilities These abilities translate well to tasks in fields like engineering, tech, and science. The complex inputs and need for rapid reactions keeps your brain flexible and alert. Professional Development For skilled gamers, online gaming opens up paths to legit careers. Popular live streamers on Twitch can earn 6 to 7 figures a year in sponsorships and donations from fans. The top esports pros are celebrities pulling in major cash and prize money from competitions. Beyond just playing, though, the gaming industry has huge opportunities in game development, design, testing, production, marketing, journalism and more. Gaming commerce is projected to top $200 billion soon. It’s a great field to explore if you love games. Stress Relief and Joy At the end of a long day, few things melt away stress better than jumping into an epic gaming session. The visual immersion in bright virtual worlds, the thrill of competition, the powerful social connections – gaming is pure digital joy. Rather than waste time worrying, you can simply surrender to a state of flow and purpose by cooperating with teammates towards a goal that seems to matter, at least in the moment. Gaming provides a profound escape that recharges the spirit. Those are just a few of the cool benefits online gaming can uniquely provide. While non-gamers may misunderstand it, we know how meaningful and enriching multiplayer gaming is in our lives. From lifelong friends to life skills, it delivers. Game on!

"Download Minecraft Pocket Edition 1.21, 1.21.10 and 1.21.20","Try to find Sniffer egg in underground structures, paint pots, and use cherry petals for crafting! Minecraft PE 1.21, 1.21.10 and 1.21.20: Last Update Many were waiting for the release of this update of the game, as the developers promised to develop archaeology and add new features. Minecraft Pocket Edition 1.21, 1.21.10 and 1.21.20 offers a number of options that allow players to: Use some mobs to search for items; painting pots; help the Sniffer to hatch from eggs; improve armor; prepare dyes from cherry petals; explore ancient ruins. Ancient mobs Some players have already managed to get acquainted with the Sniffer in Minecraft Pocket Edition 1.21.0 and learn how to search for seeds of various useful plants together with him. There are such cultures in the game that the user cannot find on his own. With the help of this dinosaur, the character can easily access plants such as Torchflower. By the way, the same flower is useful for taming the Sniffer. To help the unique mob to appear in the game, the user can use its eggs. It is possible to find them in a structure called Trail Ruins . In the same underground structures there are templates for armor. Biomes The most unexpected mob in jungle biomes is a monkey. The animal is an inhabitant of the jungle and can be tamed. It has an important function – to show the way to Jungle Temple , because many people know how difficult it is to find this structure. Now the mob lives in the game, and players will no longer need to download mods for MCPE . There are also changes in deserts: players can unexpectedly find an oasis – a picturesque place where there are additional resources. Items and blocks Many of the new items have already appeared in Minecraft Pocket Edition 1.20.12 , but in this update, the developers have added more functionality to them. The game also has content that players will see for the first time. Item Description Pots If earlier decorative pots could be crafted in only one color, then in Minecraft 1.21, 1.21.10 and 1.21.20 players can paint them in any color they like using dyes. Armor Smithing templates will help the player to fight in beautiful armor. There are dozens of different variants stored in Trail Ruins. Also, users should get Smithing table. Petals Creating dyes in the game is easier than it seems: the player only needs to collect petals in Cherry Biome and apply them with the right recipe. Cherry Wood This is the most beautiful kind of wood in Minecraft Pocket Edition 1.21, 1.21.10 and 1.21.20. It has a pleasant pink texture. Cherry blocks are suitable for the interior and for construction.

Phoodle Today Answer – DECEMBER 23RD,"Looking for the answer for Phoodle Today ? Well, you’ve arrived in the right place. In this guide, we’re going to provide you with the answer to today’s puzzle. We’ll also keep this guide updated with the solution for every subsequent puzzle. With that in mind, we recommend that you bookmark this page and check back daily so you never get stuck again. Phoodle is almost the same game as Wordle but with one key difference: all of the words you’re guessing are based on food. That could be a type of food, a famous culinary personality, or, well, anything related to that world. It does help you narrow down your guesses though, but the actual game remains similar. Guess a food word, green letters are in the word in the right place, yellow are in the word in the wrong place, and the rest of the letters aren’t in the word. You can play Phoodle on the official website . If you’re a fan of games like this, check out our Semantle Today Answer and Waffle Game Today Answer . Phoodle Today – Answer Here is the solution for today’s Phoodle puzzle: December 23RD : CAFFE Phoodle FAQ Now, we’ll answer a bunch of questions you may have about Phoodle. What Is Phoodle? Phoodle is a Wordle-like daily puzzle game that challenges you to guess a specific word every single day. Unlike Wordle, in which the word can be anything in the dictionary, Phoodle focuses on food-focused words. This could be a type of food, a famous chef, or a technique performed while making food. There’s a surprising amount of depth. How Does It Work? Well, pretty much like Wordle. Guess a word (remember, it has to be food-based), and any letters that appear in the word in the correct place are marked green. Yellow letters are in the word but in the wrong place, while uncoloured letters don’t appear in the word. You use these clues to help narrow down the correct word. Got Any Tips and Tricks? Vowels: A similar strategy to Wordle works well here. Start by using words with plenty of vowels, as they appear in most words and will give you a good jumping-off point. Try and use all vowels in your first two words. Food: After this point, think of food, or food-related words that have letters in the place described. You should be able to make some ground here. Definition: If you’re still struggling, our definition above can help. It’s not quite as simple as giving you the answer straight up. That will do it for our Phoodle Today guide.

Semantle Today – Answer The answer for Semantle today is: December 23rd : SO Semantle FAQ Now, we’ll answer the many questions you may have about Semantle. What Is Semantle? Semantle is a Wordle-like daily puzzle game that, like its inspiration, challenges you to guess a specific word each day. Unlike Wordle though, you don’t get clues based on the letters you pick, but on how close the word is semantically to the answer. You get a score based on heat – hot being closer to the actual word – and have to use that to try and guess the word in a set number of goes. How Does It Work? You guess a word and are given a score on how close your guess is, semantically, to the answer that day. Each subsequent guess also gets a score until you get it right, or run out of guesses. So it’s very similar to Wordle, just focused on similar words rather than correct letters. Got Any Tips and Tricks? Hint: You don’t get punished for using the ‘Hint’ feature, so go crazy. It will give you a word and a similarity to the actual word, so it’s giving you a single free go per day. Don’t waste it. Use a thesaurus: If you’re getting close, with a similarity score pretty high, try and narrow it down using a thesaurus. This will give you similar words to play with. Definition: Lastly, use our definition above! That will give you a good idea of what the word is to help you solve it, without actually giving the game away. That will conclude our Semantle guide.

FlexiSpot E7 Plus Standing Desk Review – Tailored For All,"Some days, I spend quite a large portion of my day sitting at a desk. Aside from working, I also like to indulge myself in some PC gaming here and there. That’s why I was super excited to try out the FlexiSpot E7 Plus Standing Desk , but is it a game-changer? Yes! FlexiSpot E7 Plus Standing Desk Review With a static capacity of 450 lbs and 4 sturdy legs that feature 3 stages, allowing you to find the perfect height, the FlexiSpot E7 Plus is one of the most comfortable desks I’ve ever used. As someone who spends a lot of time working on a PC and a laptop, a decent desk is a daily priority. A Desk Tailored To You I’m quite prone to back, neck, and shoulder pain, so I was initially hopeful that switching from sitting down to standing up would help to relieve that issue. I’m glad to report that it really does make a difference. I like to stretch my legs and have a wander after an extended amount of time at my desk, but sometimes I’m so busy to the point where it’s not feasible. With a simple click of a button, I can stretch my legs and back while still getting my tasks done at the PC. I used to be a person who didn’t see the point in standing desks, but after experiencing it for myself… I can’t believe I waited this long to try one out. The featured keypad allows you to create four presets for height preferences. This makes it quick and simple to switch between heights that comfortably match your own. It’s also an incredibly advanced keypad, providing an expert-grade customisation system tailored to your desk habits. Sturdy and Stable There’s also the stability of the E7 Plus. As I’m working or playing on the PC, I like to have a drink nearby for those dehydrated moments. Whether I’m raising or lowering the desk, glasses do not fall over, and no liquid is spilt, even when filled almost all the way to the top. This lets me swiftly change between standing and sitting without any prep beforehand. There’s no need to remove things from the desk, as there’s no risk. Ever used a desk that moves while you type and move the mouse? It’s annoying, right? Before using the E7 Plus, every desk I’ve had has wobbled. But now that I have the E7 Plus, I’ve experienced wobble-free working (and gaming) ever since. One of the highlights regarding the E7 Plus Standing Desk is the fact that you can customise it to your liking. Its versatility allows you to use accessories, including mounts for monitors, a tray for your keyboard, drawers for cable management, and more. Of course, these extra accessories add to the desk’s weight – luckily, that isn’t an issue. The E7 Plus is one of, if not the most sturdy, products on the market. You can buy it here .

Scary Shawarma Kiosk Guide – How to Play Successfully,"Our Scary Shawarma Kiosk guide goes over the key mechanics and how to respond to them in the Roblox horror game. Once you know what you’re doing in Scary Shawarma Kiosk , you’ll be able to successfully complete a shift with ease. To help, we also have a Scary Shawarma Kiosk Tips guide! Scary Shawarma Kiosk Guide There are general mechanics to follow in Scary Shawarma Kiosk that determine whether or not your playthrough will be smooth sailing. In this guide, we’ve summarised the main mechanics you have to follow, as well as what to do when certain events occur. Jump Scares Firstly, as Scary Shawarma Kiosk is a horror game, it’s best to keep your wits about you. The game can jump scare you at any time, but it often features a loud sound , such as a scream. As soon as a jump scare happens, it’s a good idea to close the shutters and check the cameras just in case. Random things can jump scare you, from customers to objects within the kiosk. Customers Aside from the horror side of Scary Shawarma Kiosk, you also need to run a business. Serve customers as quickly as possible and memorise recipes to speed it up. Expect jump scares at any time, even when serving customers. As you speak to customers, keep a close eye on their appearances. At times, they appear normal at first, but then they start to visually mutate. That or their voice starts creepily distorting. If this happens, close the shutters . Customer With a Third Eye Most notably, there’s a customer with a third eye . When visiting, they request to be served first before all other customers. Instead of serving them, close the shutters as soon as they appear. If you serve this customer, the game has a high chance of ‘disconnecting’ – this isn’t a real disconnection, but it does cause the monster in the fridge to grow. Kiosk Occurrences The kiosk is affected too. The Monster in the Fridge As well as the jump scares, there’s also a monster in the fridge. Progressing through the game causes this monster to become increasingly more terrifying. Keep an eye on the fridge as often as possible. If the fridge door opens randomly, close it. You should also only open the fridge when you need to. Meat If you spot the meat pulsating, make sure you turn off the heat as soon as possible. Afterwards, head into a safe area and wait until the pulsating stops. CCTV Camera The CCTV camera is one of the first things you should check before serving any customer. This is because anomalies can show up via the camera rather than in person. You can toggle the camera’s night vision on and off. Some anomalies have a chance of appearing when night vision is turned on or vice versa. The Inspector There is always an inspection at 2 am . If you see the Inspector’s car, you need to use the back door to exit the kiosk. Do not look back at the kiosk or at any of the CCTV cameras; otherwise, it’s an automatic game over . If you make too many mistakes during your playthrough, whether this be getting customer orders wrong, taking too long to serve them, or failing to avoid anomalies, the Inspector spawns. This also leads to game over!

How to Get the Fisch Boreal Rod – Worth It?,"The Fisch Boreal Rod is one of the latest additions to the game with the release of the Boreal Pines. At such a low cost compared to other Fisch rods, is it even worth getting? Enjoying the Fischmas event but struggling to get a specific item? Read our Fisch Hot Cocoa guide to find out. How to Get the Fisch Boreal Rod To obtain the Boreal Rod, you need to be able to access the Boreal Pines. Once there, look for the NPC called Marvin, who stands approximately at the coordinates: 21585, 135, 4150 . The rod is located close by to Marvin and costs a total of 18K in-game coins, which makes it quite the bargain! How to Get to the Boreal Pines To reach the Boreal Pines , you must sail towards the portal that takes you to the Northern Expedition island. Access the portal to be teleported to a new map, where you can find Northern Expedition, and now, the Boreal Pines. The Boreal Pines island is next to Northern Expedition, so you can’t miss it! However, if you’ve spent time on Northern Expedition, you’ll know all about the temperature mechanics . Hopefully, you already have some equippable gear that keeps you warm, which you can obtain via Northern Expedition. As long as you manage your temperature levels, you can make it to Marvin to purchase the Boreal Rod. Just be careful of the water at the Boreal Pines, as it deals damage ! Boreal Rod Stats Luck: 50% Speed: 60% Resilience: 25% Control: 0.05 Maximum Weight: 14,000kg Passives When using the Boreal Rod in Fisch, you have a 40% chance of catching a fish with the Boreal mutation. The selling value of fish with this mutation increases by 4x. Aside from Appraising, the Boreal Rod is the only other way of getting the Boreal mutation. With Appraisal, the chance is even lower. Is the Boreal Rod Worth Getting? At such a low price, the Boreal Rod is certainly worth obtaining. Considering it only costs 18K in-game coins, the 40% chance of getting Boreal fish is a great addition. With a high chance of gaining a rare mutation, the selling value of the fish you catch will be much higher thanks to the 4x multiplier. Stat-wise, it’s not the most impressive, but it’s a good option for those still in the early game. Sometimes, a weaker fishing rod is needed for certain quests, especially if they require more common fish.

Finland Breaks Casino Monopoly With New Gambling Regulations,"Finland’s Parliament received a bill that will shatter decades of state control over the country’s gambling market. The Finnish government submitted legislation that terminates the current monopoly on online betting and digital casino games. Private operators could enter the Finnish market by 2027 under this landmark reform, which replaces the restrictive monopoly system with a new licensing model. Finland Ends Veikkaus Monopoly on Online Gambling Parliament will vote on historic legislation that dismantles Veikkaus’ grip on key segments of Finland’s gambling market. The government submitted a bill in March 2025 proposing to end Veikkaus’ exclusive rights to online betting and digital casino games by the end of 2026. Decades of strict state-controlled gambling are coming to an end. The monopoly system simply stopped working effectively. The Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority found that substantial market leakage prompted calls for legislative change to redirect gambling activities toward regulated channels. Money was flowing out of the regulated system at an alarming rate. The Ministry of the Interior began drafting reform proposals back in October 2023. The licensing system rolls out in two stages: B2C licenses for operators start in 2026, followed by B2B licenses for software providers in 2027. Government Introduces Licensing Model for Online Casino Finland Gambling companies like the ones you find at Kasinoranking can apply to the Finnish Supervisory Agency for two distinct license types: gambling game licenses and gambling software licenses. Fixed-odds betting, pari-mutuel betting, online casino games, online e-bingo, and online slots will move to competitive licensing. Veikkaus keeps its grip on lotteries, pools, totalizator betting, physical slot machines, and casino games. Licensed operators will pay a 22% gross gaming revenue tax plus an annual supervision fee between €4,000 and €400,000. The licenses run for a maximum of five years, creating regular renewal cycles that keep operators accountable. Here’s how the rollout unfolds: License applications open in January 2026 Licensed gambling operations commence in January 2027 B2B software licensing begins in early 2027 Mandatory licensing for all game software suppliers takes effect in 2028 Applicants must meet strict fitness and propriety standards plus general requirements from the Finnish Enterprise Act. Only reputable operators will gain market access under these criteria. New Gambling Regulations Impose Strict Compliance Rules The regulatory authority will wield significant enforcement powers, including prohibition orders, administrative penalties reaching up to 4% of annual turnover, and conditional fines for violations. Finland’s approach to player protection goes well beyond basic licensing requirements. Licensed operators face a web of mandatory compliance measures. ID authentication becomes non-negotiable, along with pre-set deposit limits, self-exclusion options, and payment restrictions. Behavioral monitoring systems must identify problematic gambling patterns and trigger timely interventions when risky play surfaces. Marketing faces particularly harsh restrictions under Finland’s new framework. Advertising to minors gets banned outright, influencer marketing disappears entirely, and bonus-driven promotions face severe limits. Interactive marketing, such as two-way social media conversations, becomes forbidden territory, and operators can’t even react to user comments with emojis. All marketing must stay moderate in volume, scope, visibility, and frequency. Additionally, gambling bonuses disappear under the new rules. No-deposit bonuses, campaign bonuses, free spins, and free game money are all prohibited. Finland Establishes New Supervisory Authority for iGaming Finnish gambling oversight will get a complete makeover with a dedicated regulatory body taking charge. The Finnish government proposed creating a new Licensing and Supervision Authority that will replace the National Police Board as the gambling regulator beginning in 2027. Finland’s gaming market will never look the same again. The proposed changes end decades of monopoly control while creating a new path forward that acknowledges what’s already happening on the ground. It will either channel betting money back into legal channels or create new problems the government hasn’t anticipated yet.

Since virtually anyone can get a deck of cards, games like blackjack brought the opportunity to demonstrate mental sharpness and gaming skill in friendly showdowns with friends or strangers. To win at blackjack, it’s necessary to embrace a style and perfect it to the highest level. If that sounds a lot like modern RPGs , that’s because blackjack and similar games provided a blueprint for today’s game developers to follow. Let’s explore this link between card playing and role playing games. The Role of Cards in Pre-Digital Times Computers can instantly simulate as many outcomes as needed, and we are so used to this that we forget how tricky it was to randomise before digital technology was around. You basically needed a physical system that could provide truly unpredictable input, and two of the most convenient ones were playing cards and dice. With a deck of cards, you could play a wide variety of games ranging from solitaire to poker that were suitable for different social situations. Kids growing up in those times would learn a couple of card games before they knew how to read and write. Some card games like blackjack were reserved for adults and often played for small money (and/or bragging rights), providing a ready-made way for a group of friends to have a skill-based competition . Blackjack As A Mix of Skill, Boldness, and Luck To win at blackjack, several factors need to be aligned. This is a game based on random drawing of cards from a deck, but anyone who thinks luck is the primary driver of success knows nothing about it. A good blackjack player needs to have a deep understanding of probabilities and a keen mind to apply them to practical situations. The game also requires a good deal of audacity, and top players pick their spots to take risks and chase a big win. You will still need Lady Luck to smile at you from time to time, but unless you are ready to capitalise when that happens it might all be for nothing. This is why blackjack can be regarded as the prototype of many video games that force the player to make tough choices and wait for the right moment to push forward. Every Blackjack Player Belongs to a ‘Class’ class In role playing games, player’s choices are often formalised as a character class or branch of the skill tree. Specialisation is necessary in order to solve advanced quests and equip powerful items. While blackjack doesn’t offer such nuanced possibilities for differentiation, it relies on a similar principle. Each player approaches the game in a specific way – some are cautious and methodical, others like to be more aggressive and push the limits. These roles can be flexible, but most players adopt a style and try to become very good at it. While it might be a stretch to describe aggressive blackjack players as ‘mages’ and risk-averse ones as ‘priests’, it’s not hard to see that the analogy stands. We can’t really describe blackjack as a true RPG, but some of its characteristics definitely fit the essentials of this genre. Calculating the Odds in Real Time to Gain an Edge Regardless of your preferred style, you must be able to determine your odds of success in every situation and make your decisions accordingly. This is true in RPGs as well as card games, and players who know when to walk away tend to do better in the long run. It all comes down to simple mathematics, but there are a lot of factors in play and the time to crunch the numbers is very short. When they are preparing for blackjack Canada players try to go through as many hands as possible to get a better feel for the odds. That’s quite similar to doing a test run in a video game so you can put together a strategic campaign that uses an optimal character. Are Blackjack Players Good at Video Games? If these games follow a similar blueprint, it would be logical to expect that blackjack players can master RPG games quickly, and vice versa. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. While some skills certainly transfer, every game requires a very specific mindset that can’t just be imported. Even the best blackjack players would need an adjustment period to get used to terminology and the complexity of the interface. Still, if you want to become better at RPG games, practicing a bit of blackjack isn’t the worst idea. The game is deceptively simple but has a lot of depth, and it gives you a chance to determine how high your tolerance for risk really is. Since all you need is a deck of cards or a membership at a Canadian casino site, you can practice as much as you like on your own. The post Is Blackjack the Original Skill-Based RPG?

Top 5 Most Watched in eSports Tournaments,"From a few players locked up in their basements to booking out and selling major arenas, eSports certainly has come a long way. With viewership numbers now in the millions, it’s interesting to look at the most-watched tournaments in current eSports history. Whether it’s League of Legends or CS: GO, there’s an eSports event based on popular games for everyone to enjoy. This of course is not something which is confined purely to pro gaming circles around the world. iGaming in Canada highlights this perfectly and has really taken off in the province of Ontario, due to the presence of iconic games for people to try there. Roulette in Ontario has proved to be especially popular and helped the provinces’ newly regulated iGaming market to flourish since launching in April 2022. When talking about eSports events featuring top games though, what are the most watched ever? 1. League of Legends 2023 World Championship As shown at Statista , this was a huge event in eSports history and picked up a massive amount of viewers. It therefore makes it a must for this list and not something which can be forgotten about. The tournament itself, which took place in San Francisco, clocked in at 6.4 million concurrent viewers across all channels. The jaw-dropping final match between the South Korean DRX and the Chinese T1 saw the South Koreans win with a final score of 3-2. The closeness of this result made it a jaw-dropping spectacle and one that really kept viewers enthralled. It was also clear that the sheer number of people watching the tournament was a testament to Riot’s success in developing its eSports scene in Southeast Asia and China. 2. Free Fire World Series 2021 Singapore Free Fire is a mobile game that stemmed from a PUBG clone. Quickly, the game introduced its own unique mechanics and adequately diversified itself to start competing with the game from which it was inspired . This all culminated in a 5.4 million player viewership in its 2021 World Series, taking place in Singapore. Thanks to the pandemic with everyone at home, Free Fire saw a large increase in its player base, which naturally led to increased viewership numbers in all Free Fire tournaments that year. While the game is still popular, it hasn’t nearly matched the numbers it once had. 3. Mobile Legends M5 World Championship Stemming off as a League of Legends clone, Mobile Legends was mobile-first from the start. Capitalizing on the success of League, Mobile Legends focused on introducing easier mechanics for a mobile experience. Because of this, players who were fans of League but liked to game on the go were hooked. Couple that with good updates and developers who genuinely cared about the experience, the Mobile Legends M5 World Championship saw a whopping 5 million viewers tune in to see the Filipino AP Bren win the finals. 4. PUBG Mobile Global Championship 0 PUBG Mobile put in a lot of effort to grow its mobile eSports scene, especially because Free Fire had a head start in the SEA region. While they never met the same numbers, the first season of PUBG Mobile’s Global Championship stood out at 3.8 million players. Taking place in Dubai and organized by Tencent, the developers pulled all the stops to turn the tournament into success. While they couldn’t replicate Season 0’s success, it did set up the stage for PUBG Mobile to become a major eSports player and directly led to the game having a consistent player base thanks to its pro scene. 5. CS:GO PGL Major Stockholm 2021 With 2.75 million players, CS:GO’s Majors have been happening for decades now, and it is quite surprising to see a 2021 event top the list in terms of viewership. The simple reason behind that is, again, the pandemic. However, beyond that – PGL Majors have always been iconic, and the 2021 iteration was no different. With star-studded rosters and one of the best finals of all time between NaVi and G2 (with NaVi not losing a single map in the entire map), the tournament displayed the absolute domination that the European team had on everyone else. Conclusion There are two interesting takeaways from this list of the most-watched tournaments in current eSports history. Firstly, mobile tournaments clearly have a broader viewership . This is primarily because they simply have more players, as games are easier to play on a phone than virtually any other platform. Secondly, viewership numbers did peak around the pandemic, particularly around 2021-2022, when most were clumped up in their homes. While 2023’s LCS didn’t happen in that timeframe, it is clear that a lot of games hit their peak numbers during that time.

007: First Light has been delayed by two months to May 2026,"IO Interactive has announced that 007: First Light has been delayed by two months to 27th May 2026. In a classic text image announcement on social media, IOI CEO and game director Hakan Abrak writes: “007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one. “The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game.” What’s a bit daft is that they only announced the previous March release date back in September , and just had a splashy cast announcement at The Game Awards, with Lenny Kravitz playing the villain Bawma . And then they’ve waited right up until Christmas Eve Eve to confirm this latest delay… I’ve no doubt that IO are very, very thankful that GTA 6 was recently delayed to the back end of 2026 , having previously been slated for 26th May 2026 . Otherwise the studio would have really painted themselves into a corner with 007: First Light wanting more polish. They’re pretty lucky to now have this extra breathing room. Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview , with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise. So… 007: First Light is coming out on 27th May 2026 across PS5 , Xbox Series X|S , Nintendo Switch 2 and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Racing Game,"As we speed towards the close of the year, we’re going to take a handbrake turn into our award for best racing game, so pop your seatbelt on (and let’s be honest, you really should be wearing one if you’re pulling a handbrake turn), ease off the throttle, and enjoy a drive-by of our top picks. It’s been a decent year for racing games, particularly in the arcade and kart racing genres, with the lighter end of the racing spectrum proving to be a big hit with our team, and the community at large. What can we say? The Nintendo Switch 2 needed a killer launch title, and Nintendo delivered it with Mario Kart World . That ‘World’ in the title is doing a good chunk of tone-setting, because it’s the first open-world Mario Kart game, and you can tootle off, driving across a huge island, and find the answers to all sorts of unknowable questions, like, where do Toads like to go for breakfast? And how long can I follow this Shy Guy for? It’s easy-going, and genuinely likeable, and you can explore the tracks and the larger world to your heart’s content, with Nintendo having filled the place with interesting little visual treats and gatherings that you can ruin by barrelling through them. Thankfully, the racing action itself is as tight as ever, and Grand Prix now see you racing between the different track locations, adding a new feel to each event. It is familiar, but when Mario Kart 8 gave us a decade of incredible racing, we probably shouldn’t feel too hard done by when Nintendo has chosen to do a bit of inventing too. The biggest and freshest highlight has to be the addition of Knockout Tour, bringing a Battle Royale flavour to Mario Kart’s already-brutal karting combat by whittling a larger-than-ever field of racers down through a series of areas, before ending in a four-racer battle to first place. It’s thrilling, frustrating, and unmissable, and you’ll keep coming back time and time again. Fast Fusion – Runner Up The Nintendo Switch 2 didn’t just get one arcade racer at launch, it got two, and Fast Fusion found its way into nearly as many hearts as Mario Kart World did at launch. How did it manage that? Well, it was priced incredibly competitively, an indie game that proved to be the cheapest game at the new console’s launch – no, we’re not including Welcome Tour here – and on top of that, its sci-fi racing was utterly brilliant, winning plaudits from critics and gamers alike. Framed within the same sub-genre as Wipeout or F-Zero, Fast Fusion is actually the latest entry in the Fast series from Shin’en Multimedia, who’ve continually rung both incredible performance and visuals out of Nintendo’s humble systems. Its colour-changing mechanic for boosting means you can never switch off through races, and the Fusion aspect that lets you combine vehicles means that you can create something that truly feels like your own craft. Fast Fusion looks and feels so good, you could almost mistake it for a AAA title. In our minds, it is one. Tokyo Xtreme Racer – Runner Up Here’s where the resurgence of arcade racers became clear in 2025. Alongside JDM, Tokyo Xtreme Racer returned us to the kind of racing game that epitomised the Dreamcast and PS2 era. In Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s case, that was the last time we had an entry in the series, with the most recent entry arriving all the way back in 2007. The brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer put us on Tokyo’s highways and byways let us loose, allowing you to challenge anyone you like to a race, beating scrubs, upgrading your car, and working your way through every possible rival. The racing is fundamentally unique too, built on a ‘stamina/tug-of-war’ system where the race is won by finding and maintaining a lead on your rival for a certain amount of time, and not just reaching a clear finish line. It’s got heaps of content, feels completely different from eveything else this year, and reminds us of a time when everything was simpler. In 2025, that’s as good as it gets. Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) NASCAR 25 Sonic Racing: Crossworlds Alright, that’s it for this award, and you’ll excuse us for not stopping before we race off to the next one. For some reason, we’re not allowed to drop below 50MPH, which would be rather scary if Keanu Reeves wasn’t on the bus with us.",2025-12-23T16:30:43+00:00,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/game-of-the-year-2025-best-racing-game/
Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties adds a new Bad Boy Dragon mode,"Ryu Ga Gotoku studio and their English localisation team are treading a very fine line with some newly revealed features and game modes for Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties . Revealed in a newly streamed showcase for the game are the Bad Boy Dragon mode for Kiwami 3, and Hell’s Arena in the Dark Ties bundled spin-off. Yakuza Kiwami 3 is a remake of the third game in the popular crime drama series, recreating the PS3 original with some modernisation and new additions. As Kiryu has to save Okinawa’s Morning Glory Orphanage from those looking to force him and the children out of their home, he’ll be able to jump into a new Bad Boy Dragon mode. Morning Glory and Bad (Boy) Dragon? Ahem! So, what do you do in Bad Boy Dragon? Well, basically, Kiryu joins and leads the Haisai Girls gang to dominance. You’ll gather allies and train them up until they can take on the toughest gangs in the country, fighting in turf wars for territory, jumping into Baddies Battles with a small party of five, or going for a 20-member battle in Rumbles. You can also hop onto your motorbikes and raid enemy bases. There’s a ton of customisation here that looks like it could be a fun timesink. Then there’s Dark Ties, which sees Yoshitaka Mine trying to bolster his reputation and rise through the ranks. This is a fresh side-story to the main Yakuza 3 tale, but RGG has now revealed the Hell’s Arena underground fight club that you can dive into. Your goal is to dive into 1v1 Hellish Brawls and perilous races to avoid hunters through a treasure-filled dungeon in Survival Hell. Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties is set to launch on 12th February 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S , Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.

Persona 3 Reload update 1.03 brings better Switch 2 frame rates,"Atlus has released an update for Persona 3 Reload on Nintendo Switch 2 , with version 1.03 promising improved frame rate stability and a new docked performance mode. One of the main criticisms of Persona 3 Reload for its Switch 2 release surrounded the performance of the game on Nintendo’s new handheld. Targeting 30FPS made sense, but with both the game’s demo and the full release, fans and reviewers alike noted that there were frame rate drops. Version 1.03 is the answer to this, and it promises to boost frame rate stability across both handheld and docked play at 30FPS. However, if you pop your Switch 2 into a dock to play on TV, then a new performance mode is available to target 60FPS, which is a pretty impressive jump up. This update will also be rolled back to the demo of the game, to help give a new and correct impression of what performance will be like. That’s expected in the coming days, but Atlus had better hurry, because they’ve put the game on sale with a 15% discount on the eShop through 4th January, and people will certainly want to wait and see how it holds up now. Here’s the brief patch notes for Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03: Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability In our review of the Switch 2 release of Persona 3 Reload, Nic said, “Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.” Source: press release",2025-12-23T13:56:03+00:00,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/persona-3-reload-update-1-03-brings-better-switch-2-frame-rates/
Pokémon Legends: Z–A Mega Dimension DLC Review,"Given how much I enjoyed Pokémon Legends Z–A — more than most people, if some parts of the internet are to be believed — I was really looking forward to the Mega Dimension DLC. The good news is that the best bits of Z–A are still there, along with a bevy of Pokémon missing from the base game and a slew of brand-new Mega Evolutions to keep things interesting. The problem is that getting between the exciting new bits is a bit of a slog. So, what is this DLC in a nutshell? Basically, after the near-apocalyptic ending of the game, a young girl called Ansha shows up with her friend, Hoopa, and asks for your help making some donuts. Being the do-gooder that you are, you accept — it’s honestly not the weirdest request you’ve had since getting to Lumiose, so you set about getting the one missing ingredient you need. Events transpire and you wind up in Hyperspace Lumiose — a sterile-looking pocket dimension mirroring a small chunk of the city you have just come from. The main difference between the real world and Hyperspace Lumiose, other than the very muted colour palette, is that the Pokémon here aren’t native to Lumiose. Oh, and they’re all over Lv100. Your first foray here sees you getting absolutely wrecked by a gang of over-levelled Mankeys. If you’re not already at or around Lv100, you’re going to really struggle, and thus the grind begins. Your goal now is to research Hyperspace Lumiose, use donuts to open hyperspace rifts, jumping in and doing three of a limited pool of missions. Pick up 10 shiny items, destroy 5 floating Poké Balls, catch 3 Pokémon, etc. The kicker is that you have a very short mission timer based on the quality of the donut you used, meaning that you have to work fast to finish the randomly generated map. Within each pocket you will find three different Pokémon, two of which you’re likely to have already, and the third being something unique to the DLC’s hyperspace Pokédex. Finding and catching these new Pokémon is, of course, exciting. It’s a little rough though that you fight them at over Lv100 and they’re reduced all the way back to Lv20 when you catch them. Sure, a lot of the thrill of Pokémon is in the chase, but when your Lv100 Feraligatr needs to use multiple attacks to take them down, you want to catch a Pokémon with some of its bulk remaining. Do enough research and you unlock the boss fight — a brand new mega evolution to call your own. These fights can be incredibly tough. While it’s 3-on-1, rather than the 2-on-1 of the base game, you still have the mission timer, alongside the fact that these things hit like a truck (no surprise when you’re fighting a creature at Lv140). Sure, your donuts give you a temporary level boost, but you’re not going to be matching their level. Fortunately, if you run out of time you can simply pick up where you left off with zero penalty, removing the difficulty of the actual boss fight. It’s obvious why this is the case — the game is tough as nails in these fights — but to me it underscores that the developers knew how frustrating these could be. Beat the boss and you unlock a new tier of pocket dimension, offering more Pokémon of higher difficulties, as you might expect having played the main game. Outside of this gameplay loop, what else does the DLC offer? There’s a string of new side missions using the new Pokémon you caught, but other than that, not much. So… is Mega Dimension good? Honestly, it feels like it would have been post-game content a generation or two ago, rather than a paid DLC. We’re no strangers to the grind in the world of Pokémon, but I’m struggling to find a time when the struggle felt like such a chore. The idea of randomly generated dungeons is cool, but we need a less intense timer and more variety (and colour) inside each one. Doing the same missions again and again in order to get to the next boss (and eventually the chance to try to find a Legendary Pokémon) gets a bit stale, pretty quickly. If you miss the chance to catch the Legendary, it’s worse still. The difficulty spike could also benefit from being toned down a notch.",2025-12-23T13:34:25+00:00,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-review/
Vince Zampella has died following a car crash,"Vince Zampella has died in a car crash, as has been confirmed by EA after initial reporting by NBC Los Angeles . According to the reports, Vince Zampella and a passenger were travelling along the Southern California’s Angeles Crest Highway in a Ferrari when the car came off the road and hit a concrete barrier, ejecting one of the passengers from the car while the other was trapped in the vehicle which caught fire, dying at the scene.

Cronos: The New Dawn is getting an easier Temporal Diver Mode difficulty,"Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn is going to get a new Temporal Diver Mode, which will allow players to experience the game on an easier difficulty. Not much more detail has been given regarding exactly what this will do in terms of gameplay, with Bloober Team confirming more details will be provided in early 2026. A trailer for the Temporal Diver Mode has been released. Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people. Cronos: The New Dawn Review – Such is our calling In our Cronos: The New Dawn review, Steve said, “Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Strategy & Simulation Game,"The first rule that you learn in business school is probably that you need to make sure to file your taxes on time, and while I’m sure there’s management games out there that do force you to do that, I’m rather glad that most strategy and business sims take a more lax approach. That really lets you focus instead on making your dreams come true, to see the birth of a nation and its rise to dominance, to build the very best museum for ghosts, to guide customers to their perfect book, and to hatch little baby dinos. All of which lead us to our winner… When I was younger I had two loves, the Jurassic Park film and the Zoo Tycoon video game. Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that later in life, Frontier would combine both of my biggest fandoms into one glorious park-builder video game where the player gets to create their own unique dinosaur theme park on an island just like Isla Nublar. What can I say? Life finds a way. What’s more, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is the best iteration yet. It refines and enhances every aspect of the previous two games, whilst also adding in new features like natural dinosaur breeding and improved terrain tools to keep things fresh. Whether it’s protecting the park from devious hackers or delighting your guests with exciting new tour options, Jurassic World Evolution 3 brings us a vibrant and fully realised simulation. It goes deep into the park management genre whilst still providing an accessible strategic experience that will delight old-school fans and newcomers alike. Also, there’s nothing better than adorable baby dinos. – Laura Europa Universalis V – Runner Up Releasing a new game in any big and well-supported strategy or management series is a bit like reading up on the endless sequence of patricide in Greek mythology. It’s not so much the rest of the genre that a new game has to compete with, but all the years of updates and expansions that went before. For a game like Europa Universalis V , it had to compete with and succeed a game that was over a decade old! But that provided Paradox Tinto with a huge opportunity to return to the game’s foundations, to reconsider many aspects of how things like population, government control and influence, market dynamics and wars all work. Importantly, they managed to do this while also still keeping a lot of the breadth and detail that had built up for EU4. There’s still plenty of room for expansion, but where it’s easy for a 1.0 launch to stutter and stumble, EU5 gets off to a great start. Two Point Museum – Runner Up If there’s one thing you know you’re going to get with a Two Point game, it’s bad puns, and if there’s a second thing, then it’s a charming management sim that’s been adapted to each new setting. From hospitals and universities, you now find yourself in charge of the museums of Two Point County, dusting off relics and old bones, gathering unusual flora and underwater fauna, and looking to build the best exhibits to draw in as many inquisitive minds as possible. And hopefully they’ve got some loose change to make a donation or two! Two Point Museum takes a familiar template and blends it with a new setting in delightful fashion, giving you more opportunities to customise and express your creativity than ever before. It’s full of humour and whimsy, and there’s already some great new themes and additions in the form of both paid expansions and free updates.

"No Rest for the Wicked co-op update comes in January with persistent realms, but you can play the beta now","Moon Studios has revealed what’s in store for their ambitious action RPG No Rest for the Wicked and the addition of co-op multiplayer. The studio is forging a rather unique path compared to other top-down action RPGs and Soulslikes, with persistent realms you can share with other players. The No Rest for the Wicked co-op update will arrive on 22nd January in full, but is currently in an open beta on Steam . That beta has now been extended to conclude on 5th January , so you can play all through the holiday. So what’s the benefits and reason to Moon Studios’ approach? Well, as outlined in the latest dev diary, there’s a distinct lack of permanence to a multiplayer session in many Soulslikes, and shared online spaces in games like Diablo 4 and Destiny have little meaning to them, just other people running around. But there’s something special about having clanmates to hang out with in an MMO, and so No Rest for the Wicked is blending all of this together. No Rest for the Wicked will let you convert any single player realm into a multiplayer one, making it a fully online and persistent instance of the game world. Within this you can have up to four players, and you can share this space fully with characters tied to the realm, or bring characters in from other realms. Being persistent, you don’t need a host player to be online, and so anyone can hop in, harvest materials, level up their character, buy property, and go to complete main quests. That obviously means that you do need to have a trusting relationship with the other players in your realm. The video showcases some of the shenanigans you can get up to, as studio director Thomas Mahler buys up a ton of property through farming progress and then trying to flip the property to the others, and then those others getting a little bit of revenge. For the more moment-to-moment action, Moon Studio also outline how you can really work together in play, having front line character, ranged builds and healers that can be great for tackling an imposing boss together. At the same time, enemy AI has been adapted to understand more about player positioning, able to react to flanking moves, or exhibiting some new attacks that you won’t see in single player. For the game as a whole, vendors will now have fresh gear to sell cycling in and out of their shops. Enchantments have been overhauled and higher level items get better rolls – but you now have limited rerolls – while weapons can now deal crit damage, and have random Facets to provide different stats. Socketing gems will now give fixed improvements, but there’s now higher tier gems. Exhalting (a bit like prestiging an item) needs you to have completely maxed out your item first, boosting a random item in a particular category multiple times. All enemies are now back-stabbable in combat (if you’re good enough), and bows have been enhanced with a new off-hand Quiver to introduce different arrow types (like blasting, explosive arrows). Oh, and for the high difficulty sickos out there, the highest difficulty now has more enemies than before. The game has come through a difficult year, with Moon Studios having to split off from publisher Private Division and go it solo , and with Mahler having a weird moment on social media . Since entering Early Access in early 2024, progress has also been steady as opposed to blistering, but with a big update earlier this year , and now the imminent addition of multiplayer (which will certainly have been a mountain to overcome), the future for this game is rather encouraging. No Rest for the Wicked is out now in Steam Early Access, with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions planned for when it’s good and ready.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Original Soundtrack,"Music really has become a huge part of modern gaming, the best examples not just elevating the game as you play it, but sticking with you as the original compositions lodge themselves in your mind to emerge while you’re doing the dishes, waiting in line at the supermarket or other incongruous moments. The difficulty with game music is just how varied it is. There’s sweeping orchestral scores, there’s jazzy chip tunes, there’s songs, there’s ambient music, regional influence and soundtracks that look to encompass hundreds of years of history. For us, as we tried to consume as many soundtracks as we could this year, there were some clear standouts, but we had to pick one. Of all the great video game music created this year, Ghost of Yotei’s really hits the high notes – this lacklustre pun absolutely intended. Composed by Toma Otowa, a multi-award-winning film and video game composer, the sweeping and beautiful compositions that accompany the player bring to life the world of Ghost of Yotei through a rich and culturally textured score. What sets Tomo’s work apart for Ghost of Yotei is the attention to detail, seamlessly blending traditional Japanese instruments (like shamisen, shakuhachi, biwa, and Ainu instruments such as tonkori and mukkuri) with Western influences. There’s even a delightful smattering of spaghetti western-style elements to the score, a perfect fit for the revenge story of protagonist Atsu. Overall, a unique cultural fusion is blended, managing to complement the bombastic gore-soaked action whilst also providing the quiet melancholy that underpins the sorrow-tinged beats of Atsu’s emotional journey. – Ade Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up It’s rare that I listen to a game’s soundtrack when I’m not actively playing the game, but then again Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a rare game. If you were to listen to the somber, melancholly of “Gustave” or the beautiful violins of “Firecamp – Sciel,” you might be surprised later when you hear “In Lumiere’s Name,” a tango for a battle with a mime, or “Is it a Gestral or a Volleyball?” which is at least as silly as it sounds. They could be from completely different games – though both French, obviously. Or perhaps the epic distorted guitars of “Une vie à peindre” would be more of a surprise? Much like the rest it, the soundtrack of Expedition 33 is emotional, whimsical, silly, heavy, and French all at once. The soundtrack is as varied as it could possibly be, from slow, morosely beautiful, smaller tracks perfect for the dramatic brooding over the most recent unbelievable revelations, all the way up to the huge heavy hitting boss battles that really get your heart pounding when you need to try and keep focused on parrying and dodging. Frankly, it’s a delight all the way through. It’s clear that composer Lorien Testard poured a lot of love into this soundtrack and it shows as, truly, one of the best I’ve experienced ever. – Gamoc Skate Story – Runner Up How do you soundtrack a game about a glass skateboarding demon on their way to eat the moon? If you’re Sam Eng and you’re making Skate Story , you draft in an entire indie band and let them loose on your gorgeous, existential exploration of the underworld. There’s a lot of leeway in what that might sound like, but with the neon, crystal-infused, ephemeral visuals, it made sense to bring electronica, synth, and a retro-modern outlook that speaks to the 1980s as much as it does the 2020s. This is a true album too. Skate Story Vol.1 is an auditory journey that’s as essential as the game it soundtracks, and you’ll find yourself travelling back to the half-places and looming edifices of the demon’s journey as you sink ever further into Blood Cultures’ retro-pop. – Dom Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) Europa Universalis 5 Fresh Tracks South of Midnight That’s this weekend’s awards wrapped up.

Something for the Weekend – 20/12/25,"With Christmas next week and how the weekends have fallen around it, we’ve made it through to what will be the final weekly round up of 2025.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Multiplayer Game,"2025 has been a huge year for multiplayer gaming. From big budget sequels in major franchises, to emerging genres like the extraction shooter breaking into the mainstream, and smaller, more experimental indie games, there’s been a little bit of everything for everyone to enjoy – so long as you enjoy other people, I guess. So, of all the headline-grabbing multiplayer games, both expected and unexpected, which came out on top? When Lethal Company exploded in popularity back in 2023, it triggered a major shift in the culture around multiplayer gaming – competitive argument-simulators like Jackbox and Among Us remain popular, but a new crop of games focused on chaotic co-op shenanigans emerged out of the woodwork. PEAK represents not only the best of that new genre we playfully refer to as “friendslop” – it represents the most fun you can have with a new multiplayer game this year, and it’s a major achievement in online gaming. The concept is simple: it’s a co-op game about climbing, and if you and your three friends have to try to scale the massive multi-biome summit laid out before you. Fail to do so and your run is over. The fluid, physics-based absurdity of the game generates a million laughs a minute, but even in downtime and defeat there’s fun to be had. The game smartly lets dead players not just spectate the remaining crew, but float around as adorable ghosts, berate the surviving climbers, and even get in their face and distract them a little bit. It’s a wonderful blend of friendsloppy chaos and genuinely well-designed systems that has made it the best multiplayer that money can buy in 2025. – Miguel Mario Kart World – Runner Up How do you follow up from near perfection? It’s a problem that you could argue Nintendo has faced many times over the decades, but was definitely true for creating a sequel to Mario Kart 8 . That kart racer had sat atop the genre for a decade, presiding over both Wii U and Nintendo Switch as the best-selling game, and being exceptionally well supported with DLC through the years. So how do you top that? Well, you don’t, really. You turn right and just go for a drive through the countryside for a while. Going open world is a huge part of what makes Mario Kart World feel new and different. In addition to having the many themed race circuits, they’re all joined up by a network of roads and environments that you can also race through – OK, that you have to race through because Nintendo decided to put really emphasise this. With larger lobbies, wider roads and more items, Mario Kart World is even more of a light party game than before. But then there’s the Knockout Tour, the Battle Royale racing mode that features huge map-wide races, eliminates players at regular intervals, and builds up to a real pressure moment to survive to the very end. It’s a lot of chaotic fun, perhaps a touch too chaotic, and with Nintendo’s typical quirks like not letting you party up for matchmaking (that they’ve thankfully tweaked in patches), but it remains an essential purchase for any Nintendo Switch 2 owner. Battlefield 6 – Runner Up 2025 was the year that Battlefield finally, well and truly, stuck it to Call of Duty . EA placed a huge bet in assembling a collective Battlefield Studios around DICE, and while some parts of Battlefield 6 have been a miss, the core multiplayer brings back a lot of the tone, feel and action that defined this series through the early 2010s. 64-player matches, defined classes, vehicular warfare are all here, and it’s great to get back to basics alongside some new and inventive game modes. Through launch and its first season, the main complaints to lodge against Battlefield 6 have been a lack of large-scale maps that defined this franchise, and Battlefield Studios’ annoying tinkering to shorten match lengths and reduce player counts, and (of course) some rather silly looking skins in the battle pass, and then backtrack when the community complains that this is stupid and not what they want. But the core is still there, and we hope that 2026 sees Battlefield Studios build and grow around that.

REPO’s next update will let you use a walkie talkie,"REPO has given been one final development update before the year is up, and developer Semiwork has listened to the feedback of what a lot of players wanted. Yes, players will be able use a walkie talkie to communicate when the next REPO update is released. Additionally, there will also be a leaf blower so you can blow away enemies and allies alike. The walkie talkie and leaf blower will not be the only things coming to REPO in its next update. Semiwork has confirmed that it will be overhauling the in game shop with a new visual design and new features including an Upgrade Re-Roller that lets you re-roll upgrades for a fee. The team is also working on improving vehicles and making them more intuitive to use across the maps. One of the changes will include adding drifting to the semiscooter. There was also confirmation that Semiwork is targeting 2026 to release REPO into version 1.0. R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract & Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.

"The Division – yes, the first one – gets a PS5 update","Ubisoft have released version 1.23 of The Division, a game released ten years ago and superseded by the cunningly named The Division 2. The new patch does absolutely nothing apart from give PS5 players a 60fps mode. That’s it, nothing else, just a nice 60fps update for the *checks notes* five people still playing the game on PS5. The Division Heartland was meant to be the next game in the series but was cancelled by Ubisoft in 2024, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to IGN . The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects. That didn’t work out too well as XDefiant, Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter, officially shut down on June 3, 2025, just over a year after its May 2024 launch. Since then Ubisoft have been busy restructuring their business, starting by selling off five games to Atari, the games being Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. They have also delayed all their “big” games to allow them to be more polished, although they did not say which games these were, They have also been cuddling up with Tencent to create a subsidiary that will look after three of it’s biggest franchises, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry..

Greedfall: The Dying World is on the right track but still has a way to go,"It’s often said that you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, but this is precisely what developers Spiders are hoping to do with the most recent overhaul to their prequel to the cult favourite RPG, Greedfall . When it first launched in Early Access late last year the initial response was fairly negative, with many players left confused by its title suggesting a sequel, and many others left underwhelmed by the switch to a tactical turn-based combat system. To their credit, Spiders took this criticism on board and suspended their proposed roadmap in order to address the most pressing issues raised by players. I got the chance to have a hands-on look at the most recent build and can report that it is definitely improving. First up, I have to confess that my time with the new build was not the most optimal of experiences, playng remotely and with my connection suffering from frame rate drops and technical issues. I’m obviously looking past these hiccups, but it did mean that I didn’t really get to enjoy some of the later parts of the demo. That being said, I got to see enough to be cautiously optimistic that The Dying World can find an appreciative audience. The demo build contained three main areas for me to explore, with the opening section and two saves at crucial later parts in the story. The opening section of the game plays out similarly to the original version, with you playing the role as a native Teer Fradee. You get to familiarise yourself with the basic mechanics and immerse yourself in the traditions and beliefs of the tribes before coming into conflict with the colonial forces that are just starting to exploit the land. This introduction works well as a tutorial and my second time experiencing it highlighted the more streamlined and intuitive combat system. The most important change here is that you can now control your companions in a far more traditional style and queue up attacks to take advantage of their skills and abilities. Each character and class has a distinct set of skills, but it looks like you can diversify or specialise to your heart’s content as you level up. The setting and atmosphere of The Dying World are one of the real highlights as there is a rich and detailed sense of world-building here. Reams of optional lore and conversation choices are available for those who want to explore as much as they can and the game is not shy in highlighting the contrasts between the tribal traditions and the colonial powers that invade. This contrast comes into direct conflict at the end of the opening section and your player character is thrust into an entirely new environment. The two later sections showed different areas and recruited companions that really emphasised the game’s focus on cultural conflict and exchange. Each companion seemed to have an interesting set of characteristics and motivation for joining your adventure. Obviously the finer details were not available as I was thrust into the middle of quests and storylines, but it left me intrigued as to how the story would develop. Deeper into the game, combat felt more developed as the characters were appropriately levelled and had more abilities to balance and tactical approaches to take. The final section in the demo saw me return to the lands in which you grew up and this seems to suggest a clear connection between the conclusion of this game and the world of Greedfall. Unfortunately it was here that my connection to the stream became untenable, but in retrospect this wasn’t a bad thing since it leaves me itching to find out how the story develops. All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.",2025-12-19T16:00:18+00:00,Steve C,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/greedfall-the-dying-world-is-on-the-right-track-but-still-has-a-way-to-go/
Game of the Year 2025 – Best Independent,"The indie game scene is where you will always find the more experimental titles that big publishers may not feel comfortable funding. It is such a vibrant scene that allows smaller teams and individuals to really go all out. There were a number of outstanding independent games released in 2025, and it was tough to decide on a top three, especially with how muddy the waters can be when trying to determine what counts as “indie” and not, but having made our decision, it’s time to lick the stamp and send it. After coming up as runner up in our Best Narrative Award, Dispatch has taken the crown to be the best Independent game of 2025. It blends great classic Telltale like storytelling with an excellent visual presentation, and fun superhero management gameplay. AdHoc Studio’s debut title has managed to set a new bar for episodic games, the likes of which we have really not seen for years. Dispatch manages to take a rather normal segments of life, office politics and a dispatcher job, and turn them on their heads to provide a fun spin. Office politics are a lot harder to handle when you are dealing with beings that could cause you all sorts of problems without breaking a sweat. AdHoc has managed something many studios have struggled to do in the past, and that is balance fun gameplay with a great story, and a memorable look. Hades II – Runner Up It would be remiss of us not to have the sequel to our Best Independent Game 2020 winner as part of this list. While it can be argued that Hades II does not quite meet the same heights as the original Hades, very few games could do that. What we have in Hades II is a stellar sequel which saw resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths, and a more mechanically involved combat system all added to expand the system. Hades II also brought us a new protagonist, Melinoe, and a story which sees the Titans declare war on Mount Olympus. Everything is absolutely solid in Hades II and it is only that the story was slightly less engaging than the original for why this has game has not climbed to the top of our Best Independent mountain. Hades II didn’t beat what many consider the perfect game, but it came near close to matching its predecessor. Ball X Pit – Runner Up Ball X Pit is what you would call a mad mashup of ideas that works really well. Developed by Kenny Sun and some friends, it takes brick breaking, base building, and ball attacks to mix it all up into one of the most entertaining roguelikes of the year. It is a fast paced and intense experience with balls flying everywhere as you fight off waves of monsters. Balls can be fused to make new ball loadouts that have various effects, and you also need to rebuild Ballbylon so you can get even more power ups in your fight to beat the monsters. Ball X Pit is a game that is very hard to put down once you have started your run, the action and need for quick thinking definitely grabbing your attention. Add in the colourful and bold action on the screen with the engrossing gameplay, Ball X Pit is an indie game that has captured a huge audience that just want to unload their balls. Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) Cloverpit Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo Hollow Knight: Silksong Phew! That’s a pretty big one out of the way.

Mintrocket reveals new details for Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC,"Mintrocket has released a new developer diary to mark the end of the 2025, with game director Jaeho Hwang giving details on what has been happening at the studio and what to expect going forward. We get a look at Mintrocket’s new office, but the main area of concentration is Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC which is due out in early 2026. Dave The Diver Into The Jungle is expected to have around 10 hours of new content for players to experience in the jungle village of Utara. Here Dave can spend his day helping villagers with their requests, or gathering fruit and minerals. If that doesn’t take Dave’s fancy there’s a new restaurant to visit that is run by Bancho. Here Dave can help serve multiple customers, with these customers being people Dave has built relationships with. The restaurant is not called Bancho Sushi, as the fish in the freshwater lake cannot be served like that, so instead the restaurant is Bancho Grill. When Dave The Diver goes diving in the jungle lake he will have to watch out for threats like crocodile, catfish, electric eels, and piranhas. However, Dave is not an easy snack for these predators as he comes armed with the new Jungle Gun, which has multiple forms including shotgun, netgun, sniper rifle, and a regular gun depending on the danger. On land, Dave can wander the jungle with friends and experience different jungle themed minigames including what seems to be a guitar hero style rhythm game. In addition, there has been confirmation there will be guest characters from other games in the Into The Jungle DLC, but Mintrocket has not said who. Furthermore, Mintrocket has announced it has partnered with XD to bring Dave The Diver to mobile devices. The mobile version is not going to be a straight port of Dave The Diver, with the UI and controls redesigned for the mobile experience. Dave The Diver Mobile will be released in China first with a global release to follow soon afterwards.

"Cleared Hot Chapter 1a is out now, adding the RAH-66 Comanche","Not Knowing Software has released Chapter 1a for Cleared Hot, its take on the classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The major addition as part of the Chapter 1a release is a brand new helicopter, the RAH-66 Comanche, which is an agile craft but is susceptible to taking damage rather quickly. That is not the only addition, with a new test flight area, and more fixes. Plus Cleared Hot is now confirmed as Steam Deck Verified. Cleared Hot Chapter 1a update Survival Mode This area has a handful of small mini-game modes that we are exploring. In survival mode you defend a building from waves of enemies, with health and ammo dropped in between waves. You get a cash reward for reaching the half way point and for completing the stage. Defense Simulation This just sends waves of enemies straight at a target. The enemies don’t progress and there is no ending. Standoff Range Spawns both friendly and enemy NPCs and sends them into a battle. Other Areas There are a lot of other areas for you to play with. Demolition Playground Physics Playground Standoff Range Shooting Range Vehicle Range Turret Range Radar Turret Range New Options Screen Shake – You can now adjust how much screen shake is applied (in game options) No Blood / Gore / BBQ Meat – You can now disable blood and gore. The NPCs will no longer explode into various cuts of meat after being killed by rotors or certain weapons. Active Debris Limit – Added a slider for the maximum number of physics debris pieces that can be active at a time. Lowering this will help performance in certain CPU bound situations, or really destruction heavy levels. UI FPS Limit – We’ve added an option to limit your FPS while in the game UI, to prevent melting any graphics cards unnecesarily :) Cloud Save -We also added cloud save. So you can keep synced between your various devices. Keep in mind that with the current implementation, the game syncs on quit. So if you want to swap devices, quit out of your current session before switching. Steam Deck Verified – Cleared Hot is now Steam Deck verified, woohoo! This update came through last week but we didn’t announce it publicly. Various Fixes Improved: Boss music logic so it fits better with the different phases Improved: Sfx on collision performance for props Imprived: Collision damage performance for destructible props Fixed: camera starting sometimes in strange positions Fixed: bug where you could change to different UIs in the homebase when selecting helo ending up with a broken ui Fixed: updated a few props to use the proper collider Fixed: Configured the rope pickup in some props so they work better when they spawn rotated Fixed: Mouse was hidden when using “Quit to menu” option while in a mission Fixed: Warehouse destruction model fixed so the broken parts don’t kill units inside Fixed: Hind passenger stat now match the actual number of passengers supported ingame Source: Steam",2025-12-19T13:39:54+00:00,Aran Suddi,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/cleared-hot-chapter-1a-is-out-now-adding-the-rah-66-comanche/
It’s Hello to Jason Isaacs as he joins the Tomb Raider series,"Amazon MGM’s live-action Tomb Raider show has signed up another Hollywood star with Jason Isaacs joining the cast in an undisclosed role. Given that he is English he could be playing Lara’s father or more likely, the bad guy. Isaacs was recently seen – quite explicitly – in The White Lotus where he played Timothy Ratliff. He has also voiced one of the villains in Baldur’s Gate 3 He will be joining Sigourney Weaver who has confirmed herself that she will also be in the show. Phoebe Waller-Bridge will be writing and executive producing the series. Lara herself will be played by Sophie Turner. Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018. Turner said she was “thrilled beyond measure” and that “[Lara Croft is] such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got.” Source: Deadline",2025-12-19T12:51:30+00:00,Tuffcub,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/its-hello-to-jason-isaacs-as-he-joins-the-tomb-raider-series/
Game of the Year 2025 – Best Puzzle Game,"As Dr. Kawashima’s low polycount face reminded us all in the early 2000s, working out the brain is important to keep it sharp, and there’s one genre that works out your brain more than others. At least you would hope so, and that is the puzzle genre. The puzzle genre is wide in scope, with experiences that range from simply putting pieces together to other experiences where you need a notebook to write down everything so you can refer back them as things get more complicated. Our winner is definitely on the complex side of the puzzle genre. Blue Prince is a massive achievement in the puzzle genre, providing an experience that just has so many layers to it. What seems to be a simple premise of finding a way to a secret room in a mansion, eventually spirals into a major multiroom and multirun experience where anything in the environment could be a clue for something else. Blue Prince is a game that has spawned whole communities working together to figure out the different conundrums that pop up, from uncovering switches to open new areas, to working out what certain objects across different rooms actually mean and deciphering their importance. Blue Prince is the ultimate puzzle game of 2025, and it will be one that confounds new players for years to come. Lumines Arise – Runner Up Enhance and Tetsuya Mizuguchi have seemingly made it their mission to make games about making blocks disappear in a sense overloading explosive celebration. The team smashed it out of the park with Tetris Effect in 2018 and has now shifted focus back to Mizuguchi’s own Lumines to revolutionise it for a new generation. Lumines Arise takes the puzzle element of building up your score by repeatedly forming blocks of matching colour, and presents it in such a way that you become utterly engrossed in the action. Lumines Arise is a stunning audio and visual package which doesn’t just provide an environment in which to solve the puzzles, but pulls you to be enveloped by music and art which are as essential to each puzzle as the blocks themselves. Lumines Arise is proof that puzzle games can be some of the most breath-taking games imaginable. Is This Seat Taken? – Runner Up One of the biggest social challenges we face pretty early on in life is finding a place to sit, be it at school or family gatherings. Choosing a seat is more than just finding a comfortable place to plonk yourself, it determines who you could be interacting with for the duration of being seated. And what if you sit somewhere when the person already sitting there wants to be left alone? Is This Seat Taken? takes that situation and makes a game of putting people in the correct seats while they go on a journey. Is This Seat Taken? is a nice and simple premise that creates ever increasing challenges as you figure out where people should be seated, while keeping everyone happy. If you have ever done a seating plan for a party or wedding, you know how difficult that is. The game gives you different issues to deal with. Someone might be very chatty and want to sit with someone who will indulge them in conversation, while someone else might be a bit smelly so hardly anyone wants to sit by them, and some people will want to be left alone. While not the most difficult of puzzle games Is This Seat Taken is certainly unique, taking a relatively normal part of human life and turning it into an engaging experience.

Neon Inferno Review – The new run ‘n’ gun king,"If you’ve been gaming for as long as I have, there’s now a period of your gaming life that falls into the ‘classical’ era. The 8-bit and 16-bit consoles forged gaming as we know it today, with 2D sprites and burgeoning 3D techniques transporting us to worlds we’d previously only imagined. Zenovia Interactive want you to remember those days, with their latest title, Neon Inferno, set to revitalise the 2D run ‘n’ gun genre, while leaning on modern technology to make this one of the best-looking side scrollers of recent years. Angelo Morano and Mariana Vitti are assassins waging a war for The Family. This conflict has you facing off against the Yakuza and the corrupt NYPD, working your way through the enforcers and low-level cops, on your way to the people at the top. As a run ‘n’ gun game, the overarching gameplay is instantly recognisable: run from left to right, shooting in eight directions, while ducking and jumping out of the way of the blizzard of incoming bullets. Neon Inferno has a keen eye for where to update the classic tropes, though, adding in a slick parry ability that sends bullets hurtling back to where they’ve come from, as well as an all-new feature that lets you fight on two planes. You’ve got one standard button for shooting, while the secondary one shifts your focus to the back of the screen, altering the gameplay to a shooting gallery. You move your reticle around to dispatch all the villainous bad guys, and it becomes a real challenge shifting focus back and forth between the two. It’s a clever idea, not only breathing new life into the genre, but taking familiar concepts and merging them into something new. Well, new-ish. Layered on top of that is bullet time. Using your ability to parry bullets, you can then hold the button down and enter a slow-motion state where you can utterly redirect those bullets in any direction you want. These redirected bullets also deal more damage, so it becomes a crucial technique in your arsenal, slowing the action, and sending bullets careening around towards different enemies. Where Terminator 2D: No Fate aims to be a ‘lost’ licensed game from the era, Neon Inferno takes the classic run ‘n’ gun form and gives it a modern refresh, throwing a variety of gameplay mechanics in, and somehow, making them work as a cohesive whole. The different stage ideas are effortlessly cool, with early highlights including a motorcycle chase, and a club battle where civilians are getting in the way, leading to a showdown on a smoke-filled dancefloor. These consistent, exciting shifts give Neon Inferno a cinematic, action-packed feel. It’s all just so damn stylish. The animation and art direction are absolutely brilliant, with Cyberpunk vibes and neon-infused 2D styling that riff on elements of Streets of Rage , all the way through to Cyberpunk 2077 . It perfectly ties in with the engaging, if straightforward, storytelling, digging deeper into the criminal underworld you’re part of. I love the way it’s undoubtedly fooling you into thinking this is how games used to be, but while I can categorically say that they weren’t, there are perfect nods and callbacks to games of yesteryear. Add in the energetic soundtrack from Gonzalo Varela and Qwesta, which blends old-school Blade Runner synth tones and sax with aggressive guitar riffs and the occasional high-quality vocal, and you’ve got one of the most surprising games of the year. It is fair to say that Neon Inferno isn’t messing around. The standard difficulty selection is on Hard by default, and this gives you fewer checkpoints and lets you take fewer hits, making sure you don’t misunderstand how tough games like this used to be. There are two easier-going options, for those who want to experience the game without the risk of snapping your controller in half. The middle option gives you a decent challenge, without feeling unfair.",2025-12-18T16:20:08+00:00,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/neon-inferno-review-the-new-run-n-gun-king/
"Samson’s main story will last around 10 hours, console versions confirmed","A couple of weeks ago Samson was revealed by Christofer Sundberg’s Liquid Swords studio, showing a gritty open world game set in the city of Tyndalston. The main story sees Samson in a mountain of debt so he needs to take on all sorts of jobs to try and clear it, or suffer the consequences. Now, a new FAQ about Samson has gone live, with the key points being the story is about 10 hours but exploring everything can take around 25 hours, and the game will be coming to consoles but after the PC launch. The Samson FAQ has also confirmed that the game is expected in early 2026 and will be priced at $24.99. There is no multiplayer and no microtransactions, with Samson being a single player title. There will be localisation, with different languages steadily being rolled out, but this will only apply to text as voice acting will not be localised. For the gameplay, players will be able to unlock new perks but won’t have a standard weapon loadout. Instead items in the environment can be picked and used for fights, while vehicle combat will also be heavy and a core part of the game. There has been some influence from Just Cause, the series Christofer Sundberg is credited with creating, but not in the chaotic and silly sense. It will be much more grounded with outcomes that could be unpredictable. You can drive any car in the game, but you won’t be able to drag civilians out of their vehicles. Instead stealing cars that are parked seems to be the way to get a new ride, though this will draw attention. Each vehicle will have its own handling style, which then leans into each one being useful for different playstyles. According to the FAQ the city will respond to Samson’s actions too. It says, “Law enforcement escalates based on your actions. Civilians react to what you do and how you behave. For example you need to watch out if you steal a parked car, if the police are nearby, they will spot and pursue you. They’ll escalate their efforts as you try to shake them off, making for an intense experience, testing all of your skills and knowledge about the city to escape. The city responds. It does not just sit there.” It goes on to say this about police chases. “Law enforcement is something to respect. Chases escalate, pressure builds, and mistakes matter. The goal is tension, not spectacle for its own sake.” The PC minimum specs have also been confimed for Samson and they are: OS: Windows 11 Processor: 6 cores Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card Storage: 15 GB free space Source: Steam",2025-12-18T16:12:36+00:00,Aran Suddi,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/samsons-main-story-will-last-around-10-hours-console-versions-confirmed/

Doug Bowser Retiring as Nintendo of America’s President and COO,"Nintendo of American just announced via press release that Doug Bowser will retire from his President and Chief Operating Officer on December 31, 2025. Bowser has worked for Nintendo since 2015, beginning as the Vice President of Sales. In 2016, he was promoted to Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Then in 2019, he moved into his current role, replacing Reggie Fils-Aimé. “One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong,” said Bowser. “Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers. Bowser will be succeeded by the current NOA Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing, and Consumer Experience, Devon Pritchard, who is “a 19-year veteran of the video game industry and a long-standing member of the NOA leadership team.” It is also worth noting that Prichard will become the first female NOA President following Minoru Arakawa, Tatsumi Kimishima, Fils-Aimé, and Bowser. “Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.” “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role,” said Pritchard. “Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.” In addition, NOA also announced that the current Managing Executive Officer at Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NCL) will continue in his role, but he will also be joining NOA as the new Chief Executive Officer. Further, they stated that “Pritchard will also join the NOA Board of Directors and become an NCL Executive Officer.” [Source: Press release from Nintendo of America]",2025-09-25T21:32:58+00:00,Steve Cullum,NintendoFuse,https://nintendofuse.com/doug-bowser-retiring-as-nintendo-of-americas-president-and-coo/
Mario Kart World Updated to Version 1.3.0,"Mario Kart World for Nintendo Switch 2 was just updated to version 1.3.0, and includes a number of enhancements, fixes, and improvements. Check out the full list below. You can now join friends playing “Knockout Tour” by selecting “Friends” from “Online Play” “1p.” Up to 2 players can now play “Free Roam” while waiting if the game was full when trying to join friends playing “Race,” “Knockout Tour” or “Battle” in “Online Play.” The “Free Roam” map now displays the locations of P Switches you’ve run over and Peach Medallions you’ve obtained. You can now select a P Switch from the map and move to a location near the P Switch. In “Free Roam”, you can now transform into the character pulled into the UFO. If “Dash Food” in “Settings/Controller” is set to “Doesn’t transform” then you will not transform. It is now easier to encounter UFOs in “Free Roam.” The conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions in “Free Roam” have been adjusted. When spectating in “Knockout Tour” or “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play”, you can now choose who to watch, even if you are holding the Joy-Con 2 or Joy-Con horizontally. Decreased the time between when an item box is taken by someone and the next time it is revived. Increased the invincible time after spinning or crashing during a race. Reduced the force of jumps when landing on a rival from above. Decreased the amount of time between when you finish and when spectating begins in “Knockout Tour” or “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play.” Decreased the amount of time between passing through the checkpoint and when the ranking is displayed in “Knockout Tour” in “Wireless Play” and “LAN Play.” Further increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in “VS Race” and wireless races. Fixed an issue in “Online Play” and “Wireless Play” where the ranking would sometimes become incorrect if a player went off course at the same time as reaching the finish line.

REVIEW – Cabernet,"When you think of vampires, typically you might envision dark and menacing, bloodthirsty creatures living in some castle somewhere in the Carpathian Mountains, terrorizing the local villagers. Or perhaps you think of a group of teenage vampires feeding on the eclectic folks in a coastal Californian town in the 80’s. However, in Cabernet, you’ll find something completely different – a newly sired vampire, trained as a doctor in her previous life, caring for the residents of her town, all while having to balance her urges, with the need to feed. Cabernet takes place in a 19 th century Eastern European inspired world, in the form of a 2D narrative RPG. Players will be tasked with guiding Liza, a young vampire struggling with her morality and the supernatural world she unwittingly was forced into. You are introduced to Liza in the most morbid of ways, at her funeral. As you listen to her family members speak fondly of her, the dialogue will pause for you to choose which narrative options appeal most to you about her character. These choices matter, as they impact Liza’s stats, of which, there are 4 – Music & Arts, Literature & Poetry, Science & Logic, and finally, History & Politics. These stats directly impact the actions you can take during conversations with the townsfolk. And these interactions are the “meat” of the game. As a narrative RPG, you are tasked with a list of objectives, all of which require that you interact with the townsfolk. As you progress through the story, you will uncover a hidden world of political intrigue, sinister secrets, class conflict, and corruption that spans both the living and the dead. As the story progresses, you’ll also find out how you became a vampire and for what reason you were turned. As you begin the game, you’ll wake up locked in a dark, dank room somewhere deep underground. After you escape, you’ll make your way up a few flights of stairs only to find yourself in a fancy ballroom of sorts. This turns out to be the home of Countess Orlova, who has ruled your new home for 400 years. The inhabitants of this home of both human and supernatural. You will immediately find yourself speaking to all the inhabitants, eventually being introduced to your handler who helps you get accustomed to your powers. Speaking of powers, you will be able to turn into a bat and fly around quickly, turn invisible to avoid detection, and hypnotize your fellow townsfolk to feed on their blood. There is a simple morality system in place which balances between Humanity and Nihilism. The choices you make will impact these two categories, and you will find that some narrative choices are locked behind either Humanity or Nihilism, so you need the number indicated in the conversation choice or higher to choose the desired action. Timing is critical, as you must make haste to the safe confines of your coffin before sunrise or else you will suffer death by painful fires. I tried it once; I would not recommend it! Although, there is no permadeath, you just load at your last save point. There is a helpful “clock” of sorts that indicates the time and how close you are to the sunrise. Time moves at a consistent pace, except for when you choose certain actions, such as reading a book, which improves stats. I found myself at times, reading books for all my actions before having to sleep for the day. The process is quick enough though that it never gets too tedious. Speaking of stats, each evening when you wake up, you are always in your nightclothes. Before you can leave the room, you must choose an outfit from your wardrobe. Certain outfits give stat bonuses when worn, so you must put thought into what you wear so that it benefits your conversations with the townsfolk. There are only a couple issues I should mention – I ran into a couple weird visual bugs, with a character model who had died (I failed the optional objective) and a model of his body was laying down in two different rooms at the same time. This wasn’t a game breaking, but it was odd. The only big complaint I have is with the menu UI. This was clearly designed for a keyboard and mouse, so playing on the Nintendo Switch was frustrating on a consistent basis. Overall, I really enjoyed playing Cabernet, and uncovering the hidden plots, the story of Liza, and even getting to know the townsfolk. I would recommend taking a bite out of Cabernet. It will satiate your appetite for a good narrative rpg, trust me.

Interview with Stephan Berendsen on Boulder Dash’s 40th Anniversary,"Boulder Dash is celebrating 40 years and celebrating with an anniversary version of the game. I recently sat down with Stephan Berendsen, the CEO of BBG Entertainment, to talk about this classic, its lasting history, and what they are planning for the future. What’s it feel like to work on such a classic series to celebrate 40 years? Boulder Dash has always been one of the most important video games for me. I played it as kid for hours and days on my old home computer. And when I was asked in 2017 by the rights holder, who wanted to retire, if I would like to take over this brand and develop it further, I jumped at the chance – Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary is what I always imagined it to be. The classic content and brand new, contemporary content on all relevant platforms. We always want to take Boulder Dash further and create a game for both the old Boulder Dash fans and the new young generation What new things did you want to bring to the series to leave your mark? We pursued two goals: Firstly, we wanted to bring the first three parts Boulder Dash I , II and III to life as faithfully as possible on current machines. Secondly, we wanted to spice up the classic gameplay with contemporary visuals and suitable new ideas such as growing walls, slime, an enemy generator, eggs and other things. Any challenges or concerns you’ve personally faced when working on an established intellectual property (IP) vs. a new one? Die-hard Boulder Dash fans are extremely picky when it comes to remakes of the old originals. Not only does everything have to look exactly the same, but everything also has to play exactly the same – the speed, the scrolling, the physics. To achieve this, we worked closely with the world’s greatest Boulder Dash experts including Peter Liepa, the developer of the original game. Why should gamers be excited for this new release? Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary is certainly the most comprehensive game in the series of all time. The first three games in the original Commodore and Atari look, hundreds of brand new levels in a new look, and all tested and approved by the best Boulder Dash players worldwide and with music by Chris Hülsbeck. No fan should miss out on this – we think. What would be your dream IP to work on? Could be any one, and if it’s Boulder Dash , let the world know your dream came true! Well, I am fan of classic games – and to release a new version of Manic Miner or Jet Set Willy would be something. What’s next for each of you? We have plenty of new products in our pipeline, that are well known. One game is even featuring Rockford, our beloved Boulder-Dash -Hero. We are also working on several ports from popular hits from the 80s. Stay tuned! Thanks again to Stephen Berendsen for making the time for this interview, and happy 40th anniversary to Boulder Dash ! Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary Edition will launch on July 10, 2025. Find out more about the game and links to each of the online storefronts at the link below.

REVIEW – Sheildwall,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to fight in the Roman army? To witness battles from long ago and watch the rise of the Roman empire? Shieldwall is a 3D indie game based on historic Roman battles. In the game, your objective is to capture and secure enemy flags. You will raise a Roman army of different units to help fight and defend. These units will consist of spearmen, defenders, legionaries, and militia. Throughout the game, you will collect money which will help you upgrade your army, respawn time, money income, and flag capture speed. You will also acquire signs and standard points which upgrade things like money and health. Every army will gain regular points which show who has the upper hand in the battle. You will have a map to guide you to enemy flags and show you what enemy owns what flag. The gameplay is very basic; capture enemy flags, defend your flags, and defeat the other armies. These armies will sometimes have back-ups as well to make the game more challenging. At the beginning of every level, you will start back at square one and will have to upgrade to build a better army. Over and over again you will fight to gain victories for the Roman army. You may choose from two difficulties: easy and normal. Easy will only give you a bronze badge if you beat it but normal gives you silver or gold. The graphics in this game are very basic but change at every level to match the battle you’re playing. I came across a couple of glitches such as spears freezing and enemies freezing. Other than that, the gameplay is quite smooth and not bad for a game like itself. You will come across multiple armies in levels, some having spears, others swords, and sometimes a mix of things. These armies vary in color and will have different outfits and shields. The graphics may be basic but it still gives the game a nice touch and feeling of the actual battles. The game also adds background information to the battles which enhances the game and helps you learn about the battles. Overall, Sheildwall is a neat little 3D indie game. I enjoyed it, and I think it is great for someone who is into Roman history and resource management. In the end, this game is basic but fun.

Mario Kart World Brings an Open World and More to Nintendo Switch 2 This June,"Start your engines — Nintendo has just dropped a turbo-charged info bomb with the Mario Kart World Direct , revealing everything we need to know about the most ambitious installment in the franchise’s history. Mario Kart World is racing onto the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch on June 5, 2025 , and it’s unlike anything the series has seen before. An Interconnected World is Your New Racetrack For the first time ever, Mario Kart goes open world — not just open course . Instead of simply selecting isolated tracks, Mario Kart World is built around an interconnected environment where courses are connected by roads, deserts, oceans, and cities. You can drive from one region to another, with weather, terrain, and even time of day changing dynamically around you. In Grand Prix mode, this world integration becomes part of the challenge. Imagine racing through Mario Bros. Circuit, then physically driving from there to Crown City for the next leg. No warp screens — just roads and rival racers between you and the next cup. More Players, More Modes, More Mayhem The series staples are back and bigger than ever — but with massive upgrades. Up to 24 players can now join races, whether in Grand Prix, the new Knockout Tour mode, or Battle Mode. Knockout Tour is a high-stakes, multi-checkpoint race where failing to reach the next checkpoint means elimination. Think Mario Kart meets battle royale. Free Roam lets you and friends cruise the open world, discover hidden coins, take on missions via P Switches, snap photos, and just vibe. Battle Mode returns with Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, now with more chaos and carnage than ever. And yes, Time Trials and VS Race return as well, with new twists like real-time ghost data and rule customization, including team-based setups and track-to-track sprints. New Tech: Charge Jumps, Rewinds, Wall-Riding, and More Mario Kart World introduces a slew of slick new mechanics: Charge Jump lets racers leap over obstacles, grind rails, or even ride along walls for secret shortcuts. Rewind allows players to reset their kart’s position after a mistake — a solo-only feature that can help recover without breaking the flow. Smart Steering, tilt controls, and auto-acceleration options are all still available for accessibility and family fun. Characters, Items, and Surprises Galore In addition to series regulars like Mario, Peach, and Bowser, the roster now includes unexpected choices like Goomba, Spike, and even Cow. The item lineup is just as wild: Coin Shells bump rivals and spawn speed-boosting coins. Kamek’s Magic creates havoc by unleashing a magical attack with various results. Ice Flower , Hammer , Mega Mushroom , and Feather all make their return from previous games with exciting effects. Dash Food from in-game drive-thrus grants speed boosts and unlocks character outfits — because fashion matters at 150cc. Play Together, Anywhere — With Faces and Voices Too Whether you’re racing couch co-op (up to four on one Switch 2), wirelessly connecting eight players locally, or hopping into massive online races with 24 global participants, Mario Kart World is built to bring people together. The new GameChat feature allows voice chat through the system’s built-in mic (no app needed), and will be free to use until March 31, 2026. Got the Switch 2 Camera ? You’ll see players’ faces next to their karts — up to four on the same system, or dozens online. It’s a fun twist that makes each race feel more personal. Launching alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, Mario Kart World isn’t just another sequel — it’s a reinvention. With expansive environments, massive multiplayer options, and more ways to play than ever before, it’s poised to become the definitive Mario Kart experience. Whether you’re out for glory in Grand Prix, exploring secrets in Free Roam, or just trying to squash your friends with a Mega Mushroom, there’s only one rule: never let off the gas.

"Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Orders Might Begin on May 8, 2025","During the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2, 2025, Nintendo stated that pre-orders would begin on April 9. However, just a couple days later, we found out pre-orders would be delayed due to the newly announced tariffs. At that point, while the release date had not changed from June 5, 2025, we didn’t know exactly when we would be able to order our new consoles. There is one bit of interesting information we found on the Nintendo website , though: “The first batch of invitations will go out starting May 8, 2025, with additional batches of invitation emails sent periodically until purchasing on My Nintendo Store is opened to everyone.” This might not be brand new information, but it has led many to believe that’s when the new pre-order date will be. Until then, we will continue to wait with anticipation for an official pre-order date and to get our hands on Nintendo’s newest console.",2025-04-12T16:39:56+00:00,Steve Cullum,NintendoFuse,https://nintendofuse.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-might-begin-on-may-8-2025/

"Nintendo Today, Virtual Game Cards, Metroid Prime 4, and More","Just ahead of the upcoming Nintendo Direct for Nintendo Switch 2 on April 2, 2025, we were treated to a Nintendo Direct focused on the current Switch. Most of the 37-minute video was focused on providing a lot of new info for upcoming games like Metroid Prime 4 and very little info for newly announced games like Tamodachi Life: Living the Dream , but we also learned about a new feature coming to Switch and a new smartphone app for Nintendo calendar and news. Metroid Prime 4 Beyond will drop Samus on a mysterious planet called Vieweros, where there is a colossal tree in the center. As she scans relics and fights enemy aliens, she is granted psychic abilities that allow her to operate magnetisms, open doors, and control the trajectory of her beams. Someone mysterious also calls her “Chosen One.” We were told there will be threads intertwining beyond space and time, and we saw either a new suit/form in red and purple–or maybe it was a new character–at the end of this segment. After a firmware update in late April 2025, the new Virtual Game Card feature will allow players to assign games to a specific system. For example, if you have two Nintendo Switch systems, you can assign a Zelda game to your home Switch and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to your Switch Lite for when you travel. You can use up to 2 systems at a time, though. Additionally, you can also loan games to one family member at a time for up to two weeks–just as long as you are on the same Nintendo family account. This essentially lets players move and loan their digital games just like they can with their physical games. The final announcement of this Nintendo Direct moved the attention to smart devices. Later today, March 27, 2025, Nintendo will launch a new app called Nintendo Today as a way to communicate even more directly with the fans. This calendar and news app will be updated daily with Nintendo game events and news about existing and upcoming games and systems–including information about Nintendo Switch 2 after the Nintendo Direct on April 2. It will also allow for Nintendo-themed calendar widgets that you can use on your smart device home screen.

REVIEW – Dead Cells,"Fight, upgrade, explore, die. Will you make it? Can you possibly escape the inescapable? Or will you fall to the hand of monsters set on destroying you? Dead Cells is a 2D platformer made by Evil Empire and Motion Twin. In this roguelike Metroidvania, you are the Beheaded, a prisoner who wakes up and has to escape an island partially infected with a disease known as the Malaise. As you make your great escape, you come across monsters and bosses. The game gets more difficult the further you progress, but finally, you’re at the end… Or so you thought. Instead, you’re in the middle of fighting the final boss, but then you die. Over and over again, you die–each time going back to the beginning. So your goal is to upgrade, defend, and make your way to the end without dying at all. There are multiple areas to explore, featuring a beautiful world of ever-changing scenery. The visuals are smooth and flawless and the background adds a nice touch of scenery that compliments the levels. The monsters and characters are animated very well. Each level and monster has its own unique colors which adds a nice touch to the whole game. You will come across some enemies that are animated differently than others but might have the same function maybe with a spin. The maps are randomly generated, but the scenery doesn’t change. The controls are very simplistic and easy to use and I quickly got the hang of them. You have four slots: two for weapons and two for traps. You will use your simple x and y buttons and triggers for these. Overall, Dead Cells runs very smoothly. You can release traps and fight with both melee and long-ranged weapons. As I stated earlier, the enemies and bosses will get harder the further you progress, but this certainly feels more satisfying when you beat them! You also come across mini-bosses, or Elites. Fighting them will sometimes give you Runes, which grant you special abilities, but more on that later. You can also upgrade your weapons and health with power scrolls and buy new weapons. Every level, you will encounter different enemy types and more of them. This game is great for those who like beating up enemies and fighting, as every hit is an achievement. You won’t be able to rely solely on offensive moves to progress, though- you’ll have to perfect dodging as well. Failing to dodge will be frustrating for sure, but that’s nothing compared to the feeling of triumph when you make a successful dodge, then counter to strike that enemy down! You can use Cells that you get from enemies to upgrade and purchase items and mutations from the Cell Keeper. Mutations are special abilities that can help you in the game and can be acquired in the area between levels. You may also choose to acquire Aspects in the game before the run starts. These also give you special abilities but will prevent you from getting Boss Cells. The Boss Cells are special cells that you get every time you beat the game. To help you in combat, you’ll find amulets which have special effects. Like stomping on the ground to make fire spring up. Lastly, you will come across Runes, which allow you to do things like teleport and break through the ground. All of these great abilities help you to beat the game and make it easier. Once you finally beat the game and go back to the beginning, you have the option to go through the game again or go on to the Giant DLC, where, you’ll fight the giant you see at the beginning. You may also purchase other DLCs, which provide even more areas to explore and bosses to defeat. But if you choose to go through the main game again, you’ll get Boss Cells from the last boss, which will make the game harder and open special doors. All of these options really help if you want a change of scenery. In the end, I give Dead Cells a solid 5 out of 5. This is such a great indie game, especially for fans of roguelikes. It does contain some language and gore, though, so it is for older audiences. It is truly a great game and I highly recommend it. With beautiful scenery, all the fighting, and pushing yourself to make it to the end, Dead Cells is worth playing. It is full of exciting fights, secrets, and many, many deaths, all of which make it an awesome game and a must-buy.

"Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Ending on November 28, 2024","While Animal Crossing has been quite popular almost since the original Animal Forest game on N64 in Japan, the most loved versions have been on Nintendo’s handheld consoles . So in 2017, Nintendo wanted to capitalize on an even bigger user base, bringing the beloved cozy sim to mobile devices in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp . Rather than the role you typically play as a participant in the world, Pocket Camp makes you the camp manager, as you are told by Isabelle. So your goal is to build creative campsites, collect furniture and other items, and celebrate special events with over 100 animal friends. While the game had a high number of downloads initially, even hitting a large spike in 2020 during the height of Animal Crossing: New Horizons for Nintendo Switch, its popularity has decreased over the last couple of years. The last update for the game came one month ago, when they updated it with summer items and events, increased the maximum animal friendship level, added a new Isles of Style to Gulliver’s Ship, and added adjustments to the on-screen display and design elements. This might be the last update, however, because Nintendo just announced services will be ending soon. The online service for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp will end on Nov. 28, 2024 at 7:00 AM PT. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who has supported the title since service began. We will continue distributing in-game events and adding items until the service ends. -Nintendo PR If you have any Leaf Tickets in the game, Nintendo has stated, “Leaf Ticket sales will cease on November 26th, 2024 at 10:00 PM (PST). You will be able to redeem Leaf Tickets until end of the service on November 28th, 2024 at 7:00 AM (PST).” Pocket Camp also had a subscription service called Pocket Camp Club, which will also end on November 29. If you want to gain access to the subscription service, you must do so before October 28, at which time there is scheduled maintenance that will remove the subscription option and the automatic renewal of said subscription. In some more unfortunate news, Nintendo stated , “If your membership is set to end after the maintenance period listed above, you will not be refunded even if you cancel membership on your own.” To compensate you, though, you will receive an in-game badge that signifies the plan you were once a member of. This badge also allows you to continue playing the game with those benefits until service ends on November 29, even if your subscription was set to end between October 28 and November 29. (See image below for more details). ・The Pocket Camp Journal and monthly benefits (i.e. Leaf Tickets and fortune cookies) are excluded. ・A Free Trial membership of the Happy Helper Plan will not generate a badge. -Nintendo If you played Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp , are you going to miss it? We’d also love to hear some of your favorite memories from playing the game.",2024-08-23T17:46:07+00:00,Steve Cullum,NintendoFuse,https://nintendofuse.com/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-ending-on-november-28-2024/
"Free Demo of “Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club” Dropping on August 19, 2024","The surprise announcement of a new Famicom Detective Club game caught many off guard, and today they announced a demo is coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop on the evening of August 19, 2024, which will allows us to play the prologue and first chapter of the three-chapter game for free. Nintendo also stated, “Players can carry their progress forward to the full version of the game if purchased,” after it launches on August 29. In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it—much like the victims of Emio, the Smiling man—a killer of urban legend. Playing as an assistant private investigator, you are tasked with helping police solve this crime, which is reminiscent of a series of unsolved murders from 18 years ago. Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat? Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man urban legend, or the origin of it? As part of the continuing adventures of the Utsugi Detective Agency, for the first time in the Famicom Detective Club series, play as familiar character Ayumi Tachibana during select portions of the story. As an investigative duo, you’ll dive deeper into this intense story of suspicion, isolation and fragility.

Indie Game Club Issue 9: Moonring,"Welcome back to Indie Game Club! This week, I am here discussing my thoughts after trying Moonring by Fluttermind. A retro-inspired RPG with inspiration from 80s computer games, complete with bump interaction and type-to-talk functionality. It's a beautiful game, and if you want to check it out, you can play it for free on Steam ! Now this is where I would announce next month's game so that you could follow along with the series; however, this is the final free indie game that we will be sharing with you in the club. It's been a pleasure hosting the club, and even though you won't see the banner anymore, you can still find a ton of great games made by independent developers by checking back on all of the other great articles published here at SUPERJUMP. So, without further ado, here's Moonring. Source: Author. I was not a gamer when Ultima IV was released; I wasn’t even a person yet. Moonring is the lens through which someone like me can peer backwards with the rose tint of those who look fondly on the era of bump interaction and note-taking. The neon glow of interspersed pixels creates an RPG world of incredible depth and magnitude that I felt as if a TRON digitizer could send me into its lands. The pixel artistry in Moonring is what will suck most people into its world. Seemingly doing so much more with the constraints of only a few pixels has been done a thousand different ways, and yet Dene Carter uses modern effects to achieve a loving ode to its inspiration. This game, with its titanic overworld, can seem really overwhelming for the first few hours you spend there. Even though the game tries its absolute best to avoid note-taking, until I had familiarized myself with the main quest and its major players, I spent a long time organizing notes in the integrated automatic note taker. In some ways, I would’ve preferred to take my own notes. Using the automatic note taker feels similar to using somebody else's cheat sheet on a test, whereas it was more likely that if I had written it myself, I may not have even had to use the notes later. Source: Author. My experience with retro role-playing games begins with some early NES JRPGs, and I haven’t tried to play any older PC RPGs, so I don’t have many games to compare with Moonring's gameplay. That said, I was really impressed with the dungeon hopping (yes, that is what I’m calling it now) as your pixel hero jumps from one tile to the next. Even just being able to crouch into traps to disarm them or kite enemies as your shields recharge becomes an interesting positional dance that you do with all of the dangers lurking in the dark and damp places. I was not able to make it far enough in the handful of hours that I spent with the game to achieve any special or interesting powers, but my time with the fundamentals of combat was more entertaining than I had anticipated. The story of Moonring sucks you right into the action as your character discovers that they are what people call “dreamless”. Typically, a person is devoted to one god in their pantheon by being granted dreams by their patron. You have remained neutral in this, which makes you a candidate to become Archon should you collect the relic associated with each god as a pilgrimage. You have also come by a trinket from a secret group that knows a dark and terrible secret about this world, should you seek them out. On top of the main quest, you can go on a bevy of side quests into optional dungeons for fame and fortune. Moonring is a beast to get started on, much like last month's game. I’m glad that I could break into such a title, though, and this free little game will be living on my Steam Deck for a while as a strong contender for rainy day entertainment. This game is given out for free; however, the donation option Moonring DX lets you give the developer $5.00 USD for his work, and he has earned it here easily. This free indie game is an incredible passion project and with the console release on the horizon, I hope that more people are given access to this awesome gem.

Hotel Barcelona Explores Our Humanity in Fascinating Ways,"The world we live in now is daunting. We are constantly bombarded with headlines and advertisements that either grab your attention or make you want to look away in disgust. Video games help us by allowing us to escape into a worry-free environment where we can confront our problems head-on without any consequences or regret. However, sometimes we should be reminded of the impact of our emotions from playing video games, as I experienced with Hotel Barcelona. While the roguelike gameplay is formulaic through its design, I was intrigued by where the story takes themes like overcoming grief, how we deal with justice, and how we can accept ourselves for who we are. In the game, you play as Justine, a rookie federal marshal looking for a witch who was responsible for the death of her father. She is teamed up with a demonic killer named Dr. Carnival, who just so happens to be possessing Justine to take down other supernatural killers around the surrounding hotel. What I witnessed was a relationship that was strained yet unwavering as the two of them tried to reach an understanding about the mission at hand. Source: Steam. Between missions, Justine and Dr. Carnival argue and bicker. Here, you get to see why they have to work with one another as their ideologies begin to bubble up to the surface. You also see their opposing viewpoints on certain things, like how Dr. Carnival discusses his personal belief on murder as to whether it is justified based on the circumstances. It's conversations like these that give this simple hack-and-slash roguelike some substance, even if the structure of the game is formulaic with repetitive combat. Now, the bosses that you fight in Hotel Barcelona do have intriguing backstories that you learn once you defeat them in battle. Each one is influenced by recognizable horror genres like the baseball-wielding killer Jacob, whose backstory is that of Jason from Friday the 13th. Like the horror icon, Jacob seemingly fell into a lake near a campsite while trying to catch a flyball. Source: Steam There is also the media influencer Eve, who happens to be an alien lifeform who arrived on Earth, disguising themselves as a global fashion model that others find desirable because of their outward appearance. This goes with the Witch wanting to use others by her side because of the obsessions that they have. While Hotel Barcelona has an interesting concept - an undead killer and a capable federal marshal who wants to solve their father's death - I feel like the ideas and themes are much more compelling than the average player realizes. This is certainly something that both Swery65 and Suda51 have meant to tell in the game, even if the combat isn't exactly engaging for long stretches of time. Both creators are definitely game designers who are more concerned with wanting to convey style with imaginative flair than creating dynamic gameplay systems that will surprise and delight the masses. While Hotel Barcelona has combat that can be described as ""janky"" by some, I feel like it doesn't really matter for a game like this, as long as you are engaged with the narrative. There have been plenty of games that don't have high-caliber performances or transformative gameplay, but will influence video games for years to come. Sometimes a video game just needs themes and ideas that will make you think after you finish it. Source: Steam. I would say that Hotel Barcelona is a game worth playing, with engrossing ideas that will make you feel attached to the characters and the story being told. You just need to ignore the repetitive combat, unexceptional enemy design, and shallow roguelike structure. Sometimes, games are at their best when they present their ideas in such gripping fashion that you think about them for several days, if not even for a few weeks afterwards. That's the power of an irresistible theme.",2025-12-16T14:00:52+00:00,CJ Wilson,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/hotel-barcelona-explores-our-humanity-in-fascinating-ways/
An Interview With the Developers of Winter Burrow,"Recently, I reviewed Winter Burrow , an adorable yet deeply real, cozy survival game. Benjamin Salqvist, the CEO and Creative Director at Pine Creek Games, kindly agreed to chat with me about its development! Here's what he had to say. SUPERJUMP Winter Burrow is a 2D isometric survival game where we play as a mouse trying to survive the harsh winter. What inspired the story behind the game? Benjamin For some people it would be a surprise that the zombie survival game 7 Days to Die has inspired the cozy Winter Burrow, but the idea to make a game that explores the cross section between a harsh outside and a warm safe inside come directly from an experience in the game of running around in a cold rainy world shrouded in fog, searching for the base, and while completely frozen finally seeing the warm light from the base through the fog and entering a room with a warm fireplace. I can't remember where the idea with woodland creatures came from, but it just seemed like an exciting twist to the survival genre, and that made me think of the book The Wind in the Willows, which was a huge inspiration, and from there things just popped in by themself. Like, when we decided to go with 2D isometric graphics, Don't Starve naturally popped up and we played that and realised that we wanted something where it was more straight forward to build on your progress instead of losing it all when you die, and that was what started the idea of a cozy more forgiving survival game, which I'm perfectly aware that some people think defies the genre, but we felt it had a potential and it turned out to be true. Source: Steam. SUPERJUMP Can you dive into the mechanics of the game a little? Aside from the usual food, shelter, and defense systems, what else can the mouse do? Benjamin Well, those three things are a big part of the game. But besides that, you can engage in the story of the different characters of the game, and through them, you will progress in not only the story but also the game itself. You can also furnish and decorate your home burrow to make it feel more like home to you. But besides that, the game is mostly about exploring the different woodland areas, knitting nice clothes, and baking warm pies. SUPERJUMP This is definitely an example of a cozy game despite the darker stories of some of the similar titles in the genre. Why did you choose this warm, comfortable tone? Are there darker elements to the game beneath the surface? Benjamin We believe that the contrast between the cozy elements and the darker elements of the game enhance each other, which points back to the initial inspiration, as a warm safe burrow just feels much more cozy when there is a freezing snowstorm outside, in the same way as it is cozier to cuddle up under a blanket on a rainy day than when it's warm and sunny outside. And yes, there are darker elements beneath the surface, but they are not that dark. You can find some unfortunate souls who didn't survive the winter, and some of the characters have some emotional stories to tell, but that is it. Oh, and then the spiders, they put some people off as well. 😄 Source: Steam. SUPERJUMP What was your favorite part of the development process for this game? What was the hardest part of development? Benjamin It's when everything comes together for the first time, and gameplay and visuals and audio are all there, and you play through this game and feel that you are in a different world, that's an awesome feeling after so much pre-production time. The hardest part was probably to find the right balance between cozy and survival. It hasn't really been done before, so we had to move forward on our own, doing trial and error. It's still something we are very aware of and still tweak a bit based on feedback from players. SUPERJUMP Just for fun, what do you think the cutest item or character in the game is? Benjamin I love the Forest Strawberry that the Mole hands you late in the game. It just looks too nice and delicious and has this surprising contrast to the earth tones and winter setting of the game. For characters, it would probably be either the Toad or the Squirrel. Source: Steam. SUPERJUMP Is there anything else you'd like to share with our readers? Benjamin There is actually much to learn about nature and biology by playing the game. The Toad is called Bufo, and the scientific name for the common toad is Bufo Bufo . Or when the aunt is called Betulina, which is part of the scientific name for Northern Birch Mouse ( Sicista betulina ). And then almost all of the plants and growths are from the real world, and their location is usually close to where they would normally grow; for example, the Shrimp Mushroom grows in the pine forest where they usually would. And there are plenty more examples in the game, but I won't spoil more here. 😄 Winter Burrow is available on PC (Steam & Microsoft Store), Switch, Xbox Series, Xbox One, and Xbox Game Pass. You can learn more about the game here .",2025-12-14T14:00:35+00:00,Cat Webling,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/an-interview-with-the-developers-of-winter-burrow/

Helldivers Movie Lands Fast & Furious Director Justin Lin,"Helldivers is preparing to launch a dropship to a theater near you via an upcoming film adaptation, and it just landed a big-time director. Justin Lin, best known for directing several installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, will helm the project. Per The Hollywood Reporter , the Helldivers movie comes from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with Justin Lin’s Perfect Storm Entertainment helping produce. Lin’s credits include directing most of the installments in the Fast & Furious series, starting with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and continuing with Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), F9 (2021), and Fast X (2023). According to THR ’s sources, Lin is not a gamer and is leveraging this in his pitch to “find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.” The script for Helldivers is penned by Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the It and Annabelle franchises, as well as The Nun . Dauberman also wrote this year’s Until Dawn , so Helldivers will be his second video game adaptation. Helldivers 2 Given that Helldivers is essentially a video game version of the cult classic film Starship Troopers , turning it into a movie does feel like the snake eating its tail. Helldivers centers on soldiers hailing from Super Earth, an uber-patriotic managed democracy, who defend the planet in an intergalactic war against alien bugs, as well as killer robots and other threats. The first game was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, and Helldivers 2 arrived on PlayStation 5 in 2024 to widespread acclaim and popularity. The Helldivers movie does not have a specific release date or window. In the meantime, check out our reviews for Helldivers and Helldivers 2 . You can also read about other upcoming video game adaptations, including a new fifth Sonic the Hedgehog film , Call of Duty , and PlayStation’s own Horizon Zero Dawn .

Here’s a look at the trailer highlighting this new mission: Game Freak also released a new trailer today highlighting Mega Lucario Z, which will be obtainable exclusively in the upcoming Mega Dimension DLC, which goes live on December 10.

Paramount Announces A New 'Sonic Universe' Film For Holiday 2028,"Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel. Per Deadline , all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively. Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4 , scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it’s not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion. Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ Knuckles series? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Game Director David Grivel Rejoins Splinter Cell Remake After Leaving In Late 2022,"It's been nearly four years since Ubisoft announced its Splinter Cell remake , but the developer doesn't have much to show off quite yet, outside of a few pieces of concept art . Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA. “Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I’m rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!” Grivel’s LinkedIn post announcing the news reads . “A very special team and project to me,” the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji. (Thanks to GamesRadar , which noticed this post before we did. ) According to his LinkedIn profile, Grivel worked at Ubisoft from 2011 to 2022, spending most of his time at the Toronto offices as a senior or lead game designer, with credits on projects like Assassin’s Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, 6, and Primal, and most importantly, Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting. Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it’s unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it’s a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here’s hoping we’ll see a more concrete update sometime soon.

Dragon Quest Reimagined Producer On Remaking A Classic: 'We Rebuilt Everything From The Ground Up',"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the latest game to grace the cover of Game Informer , and to learn more about this game for the cover story, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to play two hours of the game and interview the team behind it, too. With this being the second remake of Dragon Quest VII, following the 2016 Nintendo 3DS remake, I was curious about where you even start with a project like this.&nbsp; So I asked producer Takeshi Ichikawa and director Masato Yagi about their thought processes behind developing the game, which elements are sacred ground in Dragon Quest VII, if there’s any pressure involved, and more. Here’s what I learned. “To be honest, I did feel some pressure, but for the most part, I felt the same as Ichikawa here,” Yagi tells me. “I was excited with the idea of bringing these new changes.” Ichikawa, on the other hand, didn’t feel much pressure. “I was certainly excited with the prospect of bringing these changes,” he tells me. “When we first kicked off the project, we had in mind three main components that we really wanted to reimagine for this version; the first one being the visuals, the second one being the scenario or the story, and the third one being the battle. […] It is one of the most popular installments in the series, but our goal was to offer a reimagined experience to players all around the world. But again, I didn’t really necessarily feel pressure.” When I ask where the team started with Reimagined, Ichikawa explains it’s a remake focused on showcasing what makes Dragon Quest VII so great to modern audiences. That means keeping the story intact, although lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi explained to me in a different interview how the team streamlined the main scenario; you can read about that here . “I really thought that the story of the original was essential to keep,” Ichikawa says. “When you look at [all of the] mainline installments, Dragon Quest VII’s story is quite unique and not really like the others. These characters […] go through a lot of struggles, and it is, overall, kind of a bit darker. That [darkness] is the one thing that I wanted to retain for sure in the remake.” Yagi agrees with Ichikawa, telling me in a series full of lighthearted stories with a more loving tone, Dragon Quest VII is darker. He remembers asking, “Is this actually a Dragon Quest story?” while playing the original game on PlayStation. Retaining this tone was important for Reimagined, he adds, lightly dipping into spoiler territory to discuss Prince Kiefer, a party member of the game. I won’t spoil anything here, but if you’re familiar with the game, Kiefer makes a crucial decision in the story, and though in the initial stages of development the team pondered keeping it (and other narrative moments) in the game, it remained. “That’s definitely one thing that we were debating if we should keep or not, but in the end, we decided it’s just too essential for the story,” Yagi says. “There are a lot of areas where we debated to keep or not keep, but in the end, for the most part, we decided to keep [things in place]. But it’s not keeping them as is. We did end up making some little adjustments and arrangements here and there.” Speaking more broadly, Yagi says the team behind Reimagined “really wanted to make the overall game experience more immersive for our players [and that’s why we streamlined the story. It’s also why we made some adjustments to the combat.” Closing out our conversation on the philosophy behind this remake, Ichikawa tells me, “Reimagined” implies everything is new. He says, “We really built everything from the ground up. We rebuilt everything, aside from the scenario, from scratch. In order to convey that sentiment, we felt that ‘Reimagined’ would be the most adequate title instead of ‘Remake.'” Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.

"Let's Compare All Three Versions Of Dragon Quest VII, Including Reimagined","Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the latest game to grace the cover of Game Informer , and you can read all about that here. If you're familiar with the history of this specific Dragon Quest entry, then you likely already know Reimagined is the second time Square Enix has remade Dragon Quest VII.&nbsp; It released the original Dragon Quest VII in 2000 on PlayStation in Japan and a year later as Dragon Warrior VII in the U.S. Square Enix remade it for the Nintendo 3DS, launching Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past in 2013 in Japan before releasing it in the West in 2016. Now, Square Enix is remaking it a second time, with Reimagined launching next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC. It’s rare to see a single entry get this many remakes, so we’ve created two galleries to show you the differences between the original Dragon Quest VII, the 3DS remake, and Reimagined, using the same spot across the years.

"Battletoads, Ninja Gaiden II, And More Come To Nintendo Switch Online","Nintendo Switch Online’s NES and Game Boy libraries got a new pair of games each today, the former for the first time in nearly a year. Battletoads and Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos are now available for the NES library, while the Game Boy collection gets Bionic Commando and Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters &nbsp; Battletoads, first released in 1991, is both beloved and infamous as a classic and challenging co-op brawler. Developed by Rare, it’s now technically owned by Xbox as well. Ninja Gaiden II: The Dragon Sword arrived in 1990 as the second entry of the NES trilogy of Ninja Gaiden games. You may be surprised to know that it’s a very hard game. The Game Boy version of Bionic Commando was released in 1992 as a largely faithful port of the NES original. Its arrival on Nintendo Switch Online marks its first-ever re-release. 1991’s Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters is the Game Boy exclusive sequel to Kid Icarus, and would be the last entry in the series until 2012’s Kid Icarus: Uprising.

Bungie Shares Deep Dive On Star Wars-Inspired Destiny 2: Renegades,"Bungie today offered a deep dive look at the new Destiny 2: Renegades release, which is scheduled to arrive for players next week, on December 2. The new major release for the game is an unusual one, as it’s rooted in a partnership with Star Wars. A quick look through the early visuals of the game don’t leave much room for doubt on that, as there are lots of things that look like lightsabers, stormtroopers, and villainous Sith. But as today’s vidoc makes clear, Bungie is trying to thread a more nuanced line with this release that it first appears. While plenty of features may look like Star Wars, the team is going to great pains to make sure it remains a true and canon Destiny experience. Those aren’t lightsabers but rather Praxic Blades. Those aren’t stormtroopers but instead members of the surging Barant Imperium. And that’s not a Sith – it’s a dangerous new big bad named Dredgen Bael. Whether the developer can pull off keeping those distinctions or not will be a matter to decide once we can play the game, but the early descriptions and footage offer good reason to be excited. The storyline appears to focus strongly on Drifter as a central character, acting as a conduit into some of the criminal underworld of the solar system. With his scoundrel demeanor, Drifter pretty clearly nods a bit toward characters like Han Solo in the Star Wars fiction. We also get to know a character that has been mentioned in the past in written lore entries for Destiny. Aunor Mahal is about as close as the game is likely to have to a Jedi, with her Praxic Blade that she is using to fight against Dredgen Bael. Players will pledge to a faction and build up reputation as they fight across the Lawless Frontier, an explorable space with a dedicated social hub in the form of Tharsis Outpost. Factions include the anarchist Eliksni biker gang called The Pikers, the group of sentient Vex call the Tharsis Reformation, and the rogue Cabal called Totality Division. You’ll run jobs for these factions like smuggling, bounty hunts, and sabotage-focused missions. While Aunor is shown in some pretty slick lightsaber-esque battles, NPCs aren’t the only people getting fun new Star Wars-themed toys to play with. Players will also be able to wield Praxic Blades, and will even be able to try out different fighting styles, very much like a Jedi. With the exotic primary, kinetic Praxic Blade, you can deflect attacks, melee attack enemies, and even throw. And, just to set clear expectations, Bungie has shared that the Praxic Blade won’t be unique to this content drop; it will continue to be a relevant weapon in future expansions to the game. Renegades also introduces new Blasters inspired by Star Wars, including several distinct variants, from dynamic blasters that hit harder with brute force, to more fast-firing balanced blasters. Blasters overheat and must cool down, rather than have a traditional magazine reload. We also learned about a special solar exotic crossbow called Heirloom, inspired by Chewbacca’s weapon in the movies. Players will also be able to pick up different “renegade abilities,” that seem in some way to tie together with the faction you work for. Across all the new content Bungie showed off today, one of the features that stood out the most was the music. By drawing direct inspiration from the Star Wars scores, arguably some of the most extensively varied and beloved of all film music, the new Destiny themes that were part of this preview presentation were, quite simply, riveting. The Renegades experience may be worth returning to play if only to hear more of that great music in action. There’s plenty more to learn in the complete rundown. Check out the full vidoc below to get a comprehensive look at what Bungie is cooking up. Destiny 2 continues its march into the future with Renegades on December 2.

"Yuji Horii On Final Fantasy: 'When I First Saw Final Fantasy X, I Recall Feeling This Was The Ultimate Perfection'","Dragon Quest launched in Japan in 1986, and a little over a year later, Final Fantasy launched in 1987. Though the two are now sister RPG franchises at Square Enix, before the 2003 merger between Square and Enix, these series were competitors. And if you ask fans, they might use a word like rivals.&nbsp; I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, last month to visit Square Enix’s Shibuya offices, play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined , and interview the team behind the remake for Game Informer’s latest cover story . But as part of this trip, I interviewed Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii for 90 minutes about all kinds of topics, including the aforementioned competition between his franchise and Final Fantasy. He didn’t call it “competition,” as I did, but admits, “I was definitely paying attention to it.” “Way back then, when Final Fantasy originally came out, I was definitely paying attention to it because it was something we needed to look out for,” Horii tells me. “But there’s one key difference that I really saw back then: the protagonists in the Final Fantasy titles, they speak a lot. Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves. “In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you’re not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games. So I thought that was a really interesting and stark difference between Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, but I didn’t necessarily see them as a rival back then.” Horii says in Dragon Quest, protagonists don’t “just start talking on their own.” “Final Fantasy, again, [the protagonists] just talk a lot,” he continues. “I do like Final Fantasy, though. When I first saw Final Fantasy X, I recall feeling this was the ultimate perfection of Final Fantasy.” Great taste, Horii.

FX Announces Far Cry Anthology Series Coming To Hulu From Alien: Earth And It's Always Sunny Creators,"FX is developing an anthology TV series adapting Ubisoft’s Far Cry franchise. The upcoming show will stream on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally. According to a press release, the series will “retain Far Cry’s signature standalone storytelling format” and each season will take place in a new setting and star a different cast. Far Cry is being helmed by executive producers Noah Hawley, creator of FX’s Fargo and Alien: Earth , and Rob Mac (formerly McElhenney after a legal name change this summer), creator of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia . Mac, who also co-wrote and stars in the FX docuseries Welcome to Wrexham and Apple TV’s Mythic Quest, will join the cast of Far Cry in the starring role. “What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley in a press release. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.” “Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” said Rob Mac in a press release. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.” Far Cry 6 Far Cry ’s executive producer credits also include names from various production companies, such as Emilia Serrano (26 Keys), Nick Frenkel (3 Arts), Jackie Cohn (More Better), and John Campisi. Ubisoft Film & Television executives Gerard Guillemot, John Campisi, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill are also involved. FX’s Far Cry has no premiere date or announced cast besides Rob Mac. Whether it’s the 2010 Prince of Persia film or the 2016 Assassin’s Creed film, Ubisoft has never been shy about bringing its franchises to the big and small screens. Far Cry already has a TV show to its name in the form of 2023’s Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix , an adaptation of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. There is also the terrible 2008 Uwe Boll Far Cry film, but perhaps that is best forgotten. Other recent Ubisoft adaptations include a live-action Assassin’s Creed series currently in development by Netflix, and the animated show Splinter Cell: Deathwatch , which premiered on Netflix in October, is nominated for a Best Adaptation trophy for this year’s Game Awards . For more on Far Cry, you can read our review of its most recent entry, 2021’s Far Cry 6, here .

How to Get La Noscean Shorthair Cat and Gallant Shepherd in FFXIV,"Every major Final Fantasy XIV patch comes with more or less what we’ve come to expect from the MMORPG. A handful of story quests, a new dungeon and trial, additional cosmetics and, of course, minions and mounts. The latter has become slightly less important to players over the years, but it still makes up for a good portion of the population looking to collect every little critter they can, along with riding every mount they can get their hands on. With patch 7.4 in Dawntrail , we receive a dynamic duo of cat and dog minions, specifically named the La Noscean Shorthair and Gallant Sheperd.",2025-12-23T08:29:23+00:00,Adam Beck,Hardcore Gamer,https://hardcoregamer.com/ffxiv-cat-and-dog-minions/

COGconnected GOTY 2025 – Game of the Year,"COGconnected GOTY 2025 – Game of the Year 2025 has been a remarkable year for games. Whether you’re into innovative indie gems or cinematic AAA adventures, there’s been something exceptional in every corner of the industry. The lineup was stacked with titles that pushed boundaries, refined genres, and showcased the incredible talent shaping games today. Of course, while many releases were worthy of COGconnected’s coveted Game of the Year title, only one can take the crown. So, which games made our top ten, and more importantly, who clinched the number-one spot? Read on to find out. 10 – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle No one expected Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to live up to the legacy of the great archaeologist. However, MachineGames absolutely smashed it, capturing the atmosphere and spirit of the franchise. Throw in an impeccable performance from Troy Baker, and you’ve got one of the finest licensed games ever made. 9 – Hollow Knight: Silksong After six long years, Silksong was finally released, shocking fans and even crashing major digital storefronts. With hype at an all-time high, Team Cherry needed something extraordinary to stand alongside their debut title, and Silksong delivers. 8 – Hades 2 Hades is one of the greatest roguelikes there is. With its addictive gameplay loop and drip-fed story, starting another run is an absolute thrill. In Hades 2 , you play as the younger sister of Zagreus, who acts and plays completely differently, making this a fresh spin in a familiar world. 7 – Kingdom Come: Deliverance II By placing historical realism at the forefront, the game creates a deep, immersive world that’s both tough and rewarding. Dynamic events breathe life into the landscape, turning even spontaneous encounters into memorable adventures . 6 – Donkey Kong Bananza Although a key player for Nintendo, it had been 11 years since his last outing and 26 years since his last 3D adventure. Due to that, gamers were unsure what to expect with the environmental destruction-focused Donkey Kong Bananza . Created by the team behind Mario Odyssey, this truly is one of the greatest 3D platforms to date. 5 – Split Fiction Josef Fares has been the catalyst for co-op-only experiences. Starting with A Way Out and perfecting the notion with It Takes Two, it was difficult to imagine how he could top his previous releases. Split Fiction manages to deliver an enthralling adventure that proudly stands shoulder to shoulder with his previous releases. Brimming with imagination, this is an instant classic. 4 – Arc Raiders When all thought that extraction shooters were dead, Arc Raiders burst in to tear up the script. With its tight mechanics and incredible community, this game is likely to continue to grow throughout 2026. 3 – Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Kojima’s epic stretches from the USA to Mexico and Australia, charting a strange and wonderful journey. While the original offered a solemn, isolating trek, the sequel’s world feels far more alive, filled with new encounters and expanded ways to shape your traversal across its stunning landscapes. 2 – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Clair Obscur came out of nowhere and immediately captured the hearts of players worldwide. With its stunning art direction and bold reinvention of turn-based combat, it’s poised to influence how JRPGs approach the genre for years to come. 1- Ghost of Yotei Possibly the most beautiful game I have ever seen, Ghost of Yotei takes the formula of Tsushima and refines it into a truly breathtaking adventure. Atsu is a fantastic protagonist, balancing strength and vulnerability in a way that makes it easy to form an immediate bond. Her quest for revenge is perfectly paced, firmly cementing Ghost of Yotei as COGconnected’s Game of the Year 2025. Honourable mentions There’ve been so many great games this year that a bunch just fell short of the top ten but are still worth a mention. So a special shout out to these absolute bangers too: Mario Kart World, Blue Prince, Silent Hill F, Trails In The Sky: 1st Chapter, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, Rogue Prince of Persia, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind, Ninja Gaiden 4, Lumines Arise, Metal Gear Delta and Absolum.

Over the years, the franchise has expanded to include three mainline titles released across multiple platforms, along with localized versions that introduced the series to a global audience. In addition to the core games, two spin-off titles further explored the Danganronpa universe and its characters.

"007 First Light Delayed by Two Months, New Release Date Confirmed","007 First Light Will Now Launch in May 2026 IO Interactive has announced a two-month delay for 007 First Light, its upcoming James Bond game and the studio’s first original Bond title. The game will now launch on 27th May 2026, moving from its previously planned release date of 27th March. The update was shared through a statement on social media by IO Interactive CEO Hakan Arbak, who described 007 First Light as the studio’s most ambitious project so far. He explained that “this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve day one.” According to Arbak, development on the game is progressing smoothly. 007 First Light is already playable from beginning to end, indicating that the core structure and systems are firmly in place. He said the additional development time will “allow us to further polish and refine the experience”. You can take a look at the full statement below: IO Interactive is popular for its work on the Hitman series, and 007 First Light marks a major step forward for the studio. The game aims to deliver a fresh take on James Bond by focusing on a younger version of the iconic spy and telling an original story created specifically for the interactive medium. The delay announcement follows closely after the game’s latest trailer reveal at The Game Awards 2025. That trailer introduced audiences to Bawma, a new character portrayed by musician Lenny Kravitz. Earlier this month, the team also shared their first developer diary called ‘ Beyond the Light Episode 1′ . It showcased the gameplay as well as the reimagined origin for James Bond. While the delay may disappoint fans eager to step into Bond’s shoes, IO Interactive’s statement suggests the extra time will help in delivering a more refined and complete experience at launch.

Alongside the demo launch, the development team has also shared deeper insights into the game’s worldbuilding and character narratives. ARIE: Moonprayer is a short, story-driven adventure set in a quiet yet striking apocalyptic world. With the moon slowly falling and the end of the world approaching, players journey across the final remaining island, experiencing a landscape shaped by loss and lingering beauty. Through the performance of Moonsongs that resonate with those who have passed on, players uncover fragments of memory, history, and emotion scattered throughout the land. Drawing inspiration from role-playing games renowned for their rich lore and expansive 3D environments, as well as non-combat-focused adventure titles, the game prioritizes atmosphere and emotional storytelling over action. The protagonist’s mystical instrument, the Diqin, plays a central role, allowing players to interact with the environment. All while creating a layered auditory experience that supports the game’s sorrowful yet serene tone. The demo, which covers Chapter 1, introduces players to the Malus Escarpment and parts of Puppis Firth on Cerul Island. Players can explore ruined landscapes, learn about the world and the protagonists through relics, murals, and scripted events, and begin restoring sections of Luner Village. The demo also features basic ruin puzzles and four playable Moonsongs spread across two regions, each changing between day and night. In the full release, ARIE: Moonprayer will expand with additional areas of Cerul Island. There will be more side stories, advanced puzzle mechanics, new Moonsongs, and the complete restoration of Luner Village. Progress from the demo will carry over to the full game.

Beyond Logic Brings Its Retro-Inspired Puzzles on Steam Today,"Collect the Diamonds in Beyond Logic Beyond Logic, the retro-inspired puzzle game, has arrived on Steam, bringing a refined logic-driven experience designed for players of all ages. Developed by indie creator Aaron Pile under Efficiency Through Technology Pty Limited, the game invites players into a clean, focused challenge where careful thinking matters more than fast reactions. Beyond Logic tasks players with collecting every diamond on the screen before stepping into the teleporter that leads to the next stage. The idea appears straightforward, yet each level introduces carefully arranged obstacles that demand planning and experimentation. Switches open new paths, lifts transport players to hidden areas, and tube tunnels allow movement through tight spaces. Crumbling bricks, trap doors, and timed hazards add tension, while bombs provide powerful solutions that require smart positioning to use safely. The game includes 29 handcrafted levels that steadily build on previous mechanics. Each stage expands on what came before, creating a strong sense of progression and satisfaction. The balance between accessibility and challenge makes Beyond Logic easy to pick up while offering depth that rewards patience and logical thinking. Creativity plays a key role, as many puzzles encourage multiple approaches rather than a single fixed solution. Beyond Logic also carries a rich legacy. The game first appeared on the Apple II in the late 1970s before evolving across platforms such as the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and later the Commodore Amiga during the late 1980s. Each iteration refined the core concept while preserving its thoughtful design. Now available exclusively on PC via Steam for $5.99, Beyond Logic stands as both a tribute to classic puzzle games and a polished modern release. It offers a timeless experience suited to long-time fans of logic games as well as newcomers discovering the genre for the first time.

Enlisted Just Received the “Far Eastern Front” Content Update,"A Legendary WW2 Battle Awaits in Enlisted Gaijin Entertainment and Darkflow Software have released the Far Eastern Front content update for Enlisted , introducing a major new chapter inspired by the final stages of World War II. This update centers on the clash between the Soviet Union and Japan, recreating the historic confrontation with the formidable Kwantung Army, which numbered around 700,000 troops. Players can now experience one of the war’s lesser explored theaters through large-scale infantry and vehicle combat. The update adds the Heilongjiang location, a battlefield shaped by the geography of northeastern China. Rolling hills, traditional rural settlements, and dense urban districts define the terrain. Japanese forces have established heavily fortified defensive lines across the region, forcing Soviet troops to launch coordinated assaults. At the heart of the map lies a large city that reflects the cultural overlap of the era. Stone buildings, broad streets, and Cyrillic signage stand alongside Chinese architectural elements, creating a setting grounded in historical detail. The Far Eastern Front also expands Enlisted’s arsenal with several notable weapons. New additions include the Chinese Type 88 rifle, the Italian KE7 machine gun, and the American Browning M1919A4. Japanese forces gain access to the experimental Type 2 assault rifle chambered in 6.5mm, known for its extremely high rate of fire. Heavy firepower arrives in the form of the German Ferdinand self-propelled gun, built on the Tiger P chassis and equipped with a powerful 88mm PaK 43/2 cannon and exceptionally thick frontal armor. Alongside new content, the update improves battlefield immersion. Explosions from grenades, mortars, and anti-tank weapons now carve visible craters into the ground. Vehicles display heated metal after sustained fire, and the destruction of paper and wooden objects features enhanced visual effects. Together, these changes make combat feel more dynamic and grounded across every encounter.

Anime Final Quest Codes : Use these AFQ codes to get free rerolls and other currency/resources! Complete Agris Quest List Image by Gamepur Here is the list of all the Agris sub-quests , their requirements , rewards , and how to complete them , to make tracking the questline easier. The whole questline should be doable within 20 dungeon clears , which is the hardest requirement of all. Quest Reward Notes on How to Complete Complete 20 Dungeons 4 Weapon Lucky Spins N/A Kill 500 Enemies 10K Gold N/A Kill Golem Boss in Hard Mode 3 Times 3 Normal Gear Spins Do dungeons on Hard difficulty. Complete 3 Nightmare Dungeons 3 Runes Do dungeons on Nightmare difficulty.

You can find the bundle in the in-game shop. What Does the Agris Sword Cosmetic Do? The Agris sword cosmetic gives you +75 Health and +20% Crit Chance . Note that this is only a cosmetic , and not an actual weapon . It will only replace your weapon’s looks and give you bonus stats. The base skills of your weapon will stay the same. Anime Final Quest Agris FAQ How long does the Agris event last? The Agris quests last until December 19th , and you can obtain the ultimate skill for free until then. The Agris limited bundle will last longer, until December 26th , and you can obtain both the cosmetic and the ultimate skill until then with Robux. Is the Agris Robux bundle worth it? The +75 HP and +20% Crit Chance are nice buffs from the Agris sword, but they aren’t as OP as those of other cosmetics. Therefore, it’s not really worth buying the bundle , unless you really need the other things besides the weapon cosmetic. How to craft the Strongest Cape? You can craft the Strongest Cape by clicking on Crafting on the left-side menu. You’ll need 1x Golem’s Heart (drops from 1st dungeon), 4x Monkey Hair (drops from 2nd dungeon), and 5x Goblin Armor Piece (drops from 1st dungeon). That covers all you need to know about the Agris event in Anime Final Quest and how to get its rewards.

Anime Ascendants Tier List [RE-RELEASE],"Anime Ascendants is a tower defense Roblox experience featuring characters from many popular shows. Each character has its strengths and weaknesses, and not all of them are equally worth getting or upgrading. In the Anime Ascendants tier list below, we will explain what the best units are, the best traits, and give you a rundown on how the meta works in the game. Anime Ascendants Units Tier List BEST UNITS S Sukuno Yuto Itochi Hosoko Goju Itadoki Shonks Free Ren Orwin Bolma VERY STRONG UNITS A Sand MadMan Kollua Ariva Nobora Hosino Megomu Gambler Gen (???) Miki Senko DECENT UNITS B Demon Lord Benimaro Togu Gen (Serious) Touci Mako Thick-Browed WEAK UNITS C Saske (Curse Mark) Ichago Gen Genas Soboto Tanji Saske Kid Niruto Kid Goko Luffo Tiers Explained S Tier : The most OP units in Anime Ascendants, being meta for various game modes. They should be your top upgrade and obtainment priorities. A Tier : Very strong units that are good for various content, but aren’t as OP as the S-tier units. Still, you’ll want to get them all eventually. B Tier : Decent units that will carry you through most story stages. However, they can’t compare to S-tier and A-tier units. C Tier : Weak units that are bad even for story stage clears. There is little reason to use and upgrade them. In the tier list above , you’ll find the general ranking of all units in Anime Ascendants right now. We considered each unit’s strength when evolved and maxed out . All units that don’t have evolutions (Legendary and below) are pretty much useless for most difficult game modes , and are only usable if they have some support utility (buffs, money generation, etc.). Check out the sections below to learn more about the ranking and each unit’s strengths and weaknesses. Tier List Ranking Factors DPS & Other Stats : DPS is what will be the most important stat for dealing with bosses in any stage, and units that have low DPS can make your clears harder. Targeting Type : Some units have full AoE or cone AoE attacks, making them OP for dealing with mobs . On the other hand, some units have circle AoE attacks that are often suboptimal. The targeting type impacts the strength of the unit a lot. Utility : Bolma and Senko are farm units , making them invaluable for shorter modes. Orwin is a buff unit , making him a good choice even for the end-game. There are many units that have support potential , buffing their ranking. Rarity : Most lower-rarity units have low stats and no evolutions , making them very bad long-term investments . Therefore, it’s best you invest into only Mythic , Secret , and Exclusive (if they have evolutions) units. Work in Progress: This section is still a work in progress. We will fill it with all the information soon!

Hello Kitty Island Adventure Switch review,"It’s been a while since I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and with its arrival on Switch, I was more than happy to dive in once more. It’s not common for me to play anything as cute as this. Sure, I played the hell out of Animal Crossing New Horizons, but I never thought I would love Sunblink’s life sim quite as much as I did. Since it came out, I’ve purchased two Tuxedo Sam plushies and been gifted figurines of the guy. It’s pure and good and innocent, and the world needs more games like this. Not only is it sweeter than candy, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is also a really good game. I reviewed the mobile version back in 2023, and much of the game is exactly the same as it was back then. You can read my thoughts on that , but as for the Switch version, it looks magnificent on the OLED screen. When docked, I did have a few issues with temporarily freezing while exploring the island, but for the majority of my time it ran rather well. After diving out of an aeroplane alongside Hello Kitty and friends, you’re introduced to the mechanics straight away. You don’t feel as empty as you did when sleeping in your tent in Animal Crossing, and while you don’t start off with somewhere to live, there’re plenty of quizzes to get stuck into. That’s the focus here. Quests are never few and far between, and while you do have quite a lot of fetch quests to do, meeting a range of characters from the Sanrio franchise and getting to interact with them never gets old. For those who want to explore the concept of escapism and cozy gaming more deeply — especially in the context of identity, creativity, and player interaction — services like bachelorarbeit schreiben lassen can help structure these ideas into an academic framework. There’s always lots to do, whether buying a gift for islanders that match their personality, craft some new items or get a house ready for a visitor, explore the secrets of the island or help out a friend in need. Animal Crossing never really featured quests as such, but Hello Kitty Island Adventure is full of them. It’s never a dull moment on the island, and doing it all as your own customised and individual character makes it so much fun just chilling under the beautiful sun. As you play throughout the year, the island changes to match the seasons, and there’s always something beautiful to set your eyes upon. It also has a range of minigames and puzzles to participate in, giving it more variety than other life sims around. Getting to play without the confines of an Apple device means playing on a big screen from the sofa helps to maintain that cosy feel you get from fishing, gardening, or playing on this gorgeous island. Hello Kitty Island Adventure on the Switch is giving players a chance to finally get their hands on one of the biggest surprises of the last five years. While it may not be as good as games like Animal Crossing, it never tries to copy or replicate. In fact, it does a lot of things better, and offers a ton of content for you to do every single day you play. If you love the cute mascots of Sanrio and want to exist in a world with colourful characters like Kerropi, Cinnamoroll, and Badtz-Maru, there’s no better Hello Kitty experience than this.

Laika: Aged Through Blood review,"I haven’t played a Metroidvania quite as smart as Laika: Aged Through Blood . While it’s punishing, it is also more rewarding than most. Once you understand and respect the physics, the satisfaction from utilising every trick in the book and using them to brutalise enemies on the back of your motorbike is unmatched. It’s story is dark yet emotional, powerful and intense, but through it all, I haven’t been this addicted to a game’s mechanics in a long time. Get ready to have your world rocked by one of the coolest video games of the era. It’s hard not to be moved by the story of Laika, a mother who will do anything to protect her daughter, her people, and her village from the dangerous and cruel Birds, an army that threatens everything you love. It is this focus that leads you on a path to cut down everyone that stand in your way. The difference is, you’re not journeying across the wastes on foot. Laika: Aged Through Blood sees you travel everywhere on the back of your motorcycle, and it is this difference that makes its gameplay so refreshing. For those who want to explore the connection between emotional storytelling and mechanical complexity in modern video games — especially within academic analysis — the service hausarbeit schreiben lassen can help frame such insights through structured research and interpretation. Everything you do requires utter precision. You’re going to die a lot in the first few hours, and even then the game ramps up the challenge so that the timing on inputs is always so tight. Mastering all the controls will leave you messing up a seemingly simple section over and over again, but damn, when the various mechanics start to click, you end up feeling like John Wick on the back of a bike. The driving physics are akin to the Trials series, and landing on both wheels takes a bit of practice. Not only are you trying to get the momentum of your landings right, you’ve got enemies firing their weapons at you. You can parry shots by sliding you bike towards the bullet at the right time, but to parry again, you’ll need to land a front flip off a ramp to store another one. Laika can shoot at enemies, however, when your bullets run out, a back flip is the only way you’ll be able to reload. You can block shots from enemies by angling your bike in the air so they shoot the bottom of it, but again, you need to get your positioning right. The option to slow time time and fire a well placed shot or get in the right spot for a landing helps somewhat, so you do have a range of options for however you take on a particular set piece. It is when you’re trying to put everything together that Laika: Aged Through Blood becomes challenging. Luckily, checkpoints never feel too far apart, and while you will find certain areas frustrating, succeeding and familiarising yourself with what you’re allowed to do more than makes up for it. As you progress, you’ll use new weapons and unlock powerful abilities, but even if you didn’t, there’s something so addictive about the controls. I was constantly left mesmerised by the way I managed to pull off a chain of feats that seemed impossible at the beginning. Laika: Aged Through Blood is a modern Metroidvania masterpiece, and while many might turn off in the first hour or so due to the complexities of its mechanics, the nuances in its systems continue to blow your mind and keep you wired into its wonder. The soundtrack is strikingly sombre yet beautiful, and it compliments the subject matter and story perfectly. I could happily listen to it outside of playing, and I was always excited to hear what played next. The hand-drawn characters and environments are also stunning, even when the screen is soaked in blood and dead bodies. I’m in awe of everything this game is, and the soundtrack and visuals are the icing on the cake. Laika: Aged Through Blood is an excellent Metroidvania that does things with its controls that few games manage to do. It creates a fresh approach to the genre and does so with the utmost precision. It will certainly frustrate you, but if you’re willing to hang on to the handlebars and refuse to let go, the story of Laika and her quest for vengeance will keep you engrossed throughout. If you love a challenge that pushes the boundaries, get ready to have your mind blown.

Folly of the Wizards announced by Numskull Games,"Numskull Games has announced it will be publishing the UpFox Labs developed roguelike “Folly of the Wizards”. The publisher says of the game: “Enter a comedic 2D roguelike action game that puts you in the shoes of a clumsy wizard apprentice. Join a wacky wizard cult and use unique spells to defeat enemies, explore procedurally generated dungeons, and save the world from chaos”. Check out the announcement trailer, below: But beware: the fate of the world rests on your shoulders, and even the smallest decision can have a huge impact. With charming hand-drawn art, quirky characters, and unpredictable gameplay, Folly of the Wizards is the perfect adventure for anyone who loves humour, magic, and mayhem. Numskull Games has published a few titles now, such as Clive N Wrench, or the beat-em-up Final Vendetta . In our review of Final Vendetta , we said: “Final Vendetta takes what was great about classic beat-em-ups and adds a stylish new look. Combat is mostly addictive, and the variety of enemies and bosses make the playthrough well worth sticking with. It can be challenging at times, and with defending yourself tough to do, it can hurt the overall experience. Regardless, I enjoyed my time with it. Playing with a friend (or a twelve year-old daughter in my case) makes it much better, so if you’re up for some co-op action, it’ll make you appreciate the nuanced combat all the more.” Folly of the Wizards is coming to PC, Switch, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5, and will available both digitally, and with a boxed copy.

No Man’s Sky drops another huge update: Worlds Part II,"Hello Games is starting 2025 strong with another massive update for No Man’s Sky , with Worlds Part II, and it’s out now. There’s a new trailer below, and also you can check out the full patch notes at this link to the official blog. First, the trailer: Sean Murray has dropped a statement about the new update, which you can check out, below: No Man’s Sky is a game that we all genuinely truly love. Last year we released Worlds Part I and I remember thinking at the time that this is just the beginning. We can’t wait to show people what we’ve been working on! There’s new solar systems, new planets with more variety, new terrain types, even new Gas Giants, and of course new adventures. Our next update is called Worlds Part II. Worlds Part II allows us to push the boundaries of our engine with new technology. Across the universe we’re adding billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets, and introducing new biomes and terrains without changing what people already love about the game. It’s now so far beyond what we ever thought was possible when we started out. I’ve been working on a new terrain system for a little while now. Terrain is more detailed and far more varied with huge mountains and these massive features. I’m genuinely at my happiest working on this stuff. The team is extremely busy on Light No Fire. Each time we push our engine to new places though we have this urge to share it with the community, with No Man’s Sky. Gas giants are truly epic, ten times bigger than our biggest planet. It’s truly end-game stuff to explore them with huge storms that rage across the surface. New tech allows oceans that can be several kilometers deep. A new lighting system makes them look so different. New caustics, light shafts and the deeper that you explore the darker it gets. I’ve had these moments where you’re exploring and suddenly some huge creature comes into view and it’s just incredible. Every element of our lighting has been rewritten. Shadows show more details, light flickers through the leaves, caves are dark and immersive. Oceans now reflect the clouds and stars to create these beautiful sunsets and night skies. Water reacts physically to the world around it. Creatures wade through it. There’s little dimples in the rain, and there are large waves as ships fly overhead. Sometimes there’s these moments where a ship just flies past the still ocean and the water ripples underneath and it’s just so peaceful to watch. In the depths of the ocean and on land there’s these new creatures to discover. I think we’ve gone probably weirder than ever before. When you land on a planet all the tech combines to create an emotion, that feeling of knowing that no one has ever been on this world before. I think it’s what makes this game really special. There’s tons of new gameplay too. There’s this huge quest that ties together some strands that we’ve been building for years. We’ve got an expedition that takes you on a tour of all the new worlds that we’re building and it’s got some incredible rewards. This is our ninth year since release. I think we’re doing things that the community probably never thought would happen. I honestly can’t wait for people to play. Thank you ever so much for your support. It means so much to me and the team. If that wasn’t enough, we’ve also got a deep dive video you can check out below, too. No Man’s Sky is out now for PC and consoles.

Yooka-Replaylee will feature Shovel Knight again,"Playtonic Games has announced that Yooka-Replaylee will once again feature a cameo from Shovel Knight, but with a twist. You see, Yooka-Replaylee is rather a do-over for the game, meaning that everything is pretty much improved upon from the original release. To that end, the developer has announced the Shovel Knight quest is new and improved, and that the Knight themselves looks shiner “and shovel…ier” than ever. Check out our blue friend in the new trailer, below: The year of the lizard and the bat is here! Kicking off the 10th anniversary year of Playtonic, we sent a pager to our friends over at Yacht Club Games saying that their shovel-wielding hero has taken the wrong exit at the roundabout (or rotary) and ended up in our game again. We were told we can keep him for a while, so excited to share that Shovel Knight will make his courageous return in Yooka-Replaylee. In addition to a shiny coat of paint, the wielder of the shovel blade also comes with a new and improved quest for you to undertake for one of those shiny Pagies. Playtonic officially turns 10 years old in February and to celebrate we have something very exciting to share with you very soon. He’s been waiting for his turn. Here’s a rundown of what’s new to this redux of the game, according to Steam : MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER – With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favourite buddy duo has never looked or moved better. NEW AND IMPROVED CHALLENGES – Improvements to existing in-game challenges and many entirely new challenges to discover and undertake! NEW COLLECTIBLE CURRENCY – Capital B’s inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games’ most beloved sentient vending machine. NAVIGATING THE WORLD – Now you can get lost in the game, not in the world! A brand-new world map and challenges tracker helps you know where you are and what needs to be done. Hooray! VENDI HAS PLENTY TO OFFER – Tonics are back with all new flavours! With the option to equip multiple game-changing enhancements, you can truly customise your playstyle. And as if that wasn’t enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer. REVISED CONTROLS & CAMERA – A new tweaked move set allows you to combine moves more fluidly while the new camera controls makes framing the action a breeze. A DREAMY ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK – The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears. Yooka-Replaylee is coming to Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.

Kaya’s Prophecy is getting a Steam Next Fest demo,"Yogscast Games has announced that upcoming card-based village builder Kaya’s Prophecy is getting a Steam Next Fest demo. Created by developers Jérémie & Thibaut, Kaya’s Prophecy looks colourful and is described as a “card-based village builder featuring deckbuilding combat, with the slight added challenge of having an all-knowing, omnipresent deity to appease.” Check out a trailer, below: Fans of the genre can revel in the satisfaction of careful resource management, the strategy of forging the perfect deck, and the heartwarming pride of watching their village grow. They just need to make sure their God doesn’t get mad and fry someone alive – simple! As the tribe grows and develops, players can unlock new discoveries to improve village life (with their deity’s approval, of course). Craft innovative new technologies, tools and structures to cultivate a thriving community. New materials and rewards lie in unexplored territories, which tribe members can explore and conquer, if they’re brave enough. Life under an omnipotent God isn’t all gloom and fear. Sure, villagers could be subject to deadly weather phenomena at the slightest provocation, but there are plenty of rewards to be given to the faithfully devoted. Players who keep their Gods well-fed with plenty of offerings can enjoy bountiful boons and goodies for their tribe. A considerable portion of the food supply in exchange for not dying is a pretty good deal, right? Players can challenge themselves to survive in a cut-throat jungle, armed only with a deck of cards and a couple of human sacrifices, and lead their tribe to glory. That is, so long as they can keep their God happy… Kaya’s Prophecy is coming to Steam for PC , and the demo will be part of February Steam Next Fest, starting on February 24th.

Split Fiction gets a new trailer showing off side stories and co-op gameplay,"As we get closer to the March release date for Split Fiction , it seems we’re getting a new trailer for the game, showing off the side-stories and co-op. Hazelight says that: “In the trailer, Hazelight founder, Josef Fares showcases more of the inventive co-op scenarios and ever-changing gameplay variety the studio is known for. The video also shows off Side Stories: optional one-off adventures hidden in the main story levels that shake up the mechanics even more, as main characters Mio and Zoe surf on sandfish and snowboard down a mountain in the middle of a futuristic battlefield.” Check out the trailer, below: You and your co-op partner play together as Mio & Zoe, two writers stuck in a simulation of their own stories while visiting the shady new Rader Publishing headquarters in pursuit of a lucrative publishing deal. An accident puts Mio and Zoe inside the same shared simulation, throwing them back and forth between their own sci-fi and fantasy fiction while the nefarious publishing company tries to steal all of their ideas. On the official blog , we get some info about the side-stories: If you’ve played A Way Out or It Takes Two before, you’ll know that Hazelight Studios are masters of co-op gameplay variety. In addition to all of the incredible sci-fi and fantasy variety featured in the Split Fiction main story, you will encounter mysterious, out of place portals that you can enter to explore all new and vastly different worlds and locations that are completely optional. These are Side Stories! Side Stories are anomalies that occur as a consequence of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. These portals are attempts by the simulation to steal unfinished stories and ideas that Mio and Zoe wrote when they were younger, leading to some truly weird, wonderful, and chaotic situations. Read our interview from 2021 with Josef Fares, here . Split Fiction is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA App on March 6th.

Two Point Museum gets a new overview trailer,"Two Point Studios and SEGA have together released an overview trailer for Two Point Museum, coming on March 4th. The team says: “Two Point Museum takes players into a realm where art meets antics, and exhibits collide with occasionally questionable management choices”, and adds that this new trailer gives an overview of the game. Check out the new trailer, below: Running a museum is a balancing act of epic proportions. Money comes from ticket sales, donations, and the perfectly reasonable prices at the gift shop. But beware – arranging expeditions, marketing, workshops, decorations, training, and all those other pesky expenses could put you in the red. Fortunately, loans and sponsorships are always available as backup, though they come with their own risks. A major component of any curator’s management duties is overseeing their staff. They are the backbone of any museum… and occasionally its biggest headache. Experts analyse and maintain exhibits, janitors handle messes and workshop builds, assistants manage ticket booths, gift shops and expeditions while security protects exhibits, donations and the peace. Skilled staff come at a price, so museum managers must keep those pay checks flowing or risk facing their wrath. So, who’s up for the challenge? In our hands-on preview, we said : “On top of everything else, it looks absolutely lovely, with the series’ trademark bright, cartoony visuals bringing it all to life. It’s also very accessible, with simple controls and easy item placement, and objectives that are straightforward while still making you work a little to tick them off. There’s something about Two Point Museum that feels more laidback than previous instalments, yet I was never bored or at a loss for something to do, something to tweak, or somewhere to send my teams of intrepid explorers. It’s too early to say with certainty, but I’m pretty confident that Two Point Museum is about to add another success to Two Point Studios’ record.” Two Point Museum is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on March 4th.

Everspace 2: Wrath of the Ancients expansion announced,"Rockfish Games has announced what it’s calling a “massive new expansion” for Everspace 2, called Wrath of the Ancients. The team says Wrath of the Ancients is coming to PC ( Steam , GOG), Xbox, and PlayStation and will be launching later “this Spring”. Check out the reveal trailer, below: Players will be able to pilot a new ship to battle against alien enemies and ancient threats in an all-new story set after the events of EVERSPACE 2. Mysterious attacks have laid waste to human settlements in Cluster 34, destabilizing factions in power and stranding survivors. With this destruction, the uneasy peace between humankind and Okkar is threatened—space pilots will venture into the Okkar Homeworlds to discover the truth behind the threat before war reignites the DMZ. During the events of Wrath of the Ancients, warp gates open to four new fully explorable star systems including the Okkar homeworlds and Aethon, adding even more secrets throughout Cluster 34. These new star systems will be packed with new enemies, weapons, and gear to discover. “Our community keeps asking when they can finally explore Aethon and the answer is soon! Everspace 2: Wrath of the Ancients massively expands the universe of the Everspace series, giving pilots more star systems to explore, more enemies to battle, and a new ship that changes the game. Players who want to discover more of Cluster 34 have a lot to look forward to,” said Rockfish Games CEO and co-founder Michael Schade, adding: “Over the coming months, we’ll be sharing all kinds of reveals for Wrath of the Ancients on our social channels and streams. Stay tuned space pilots!” In our console review of the game we said: “There are countless missions to undertake, from fetching items for various characters, investigating mysterious signals, battling raiders, and more. Everspace 2 on console has all the trappings featured in the PC version, however, it now immerses you in a way the PC version didn’t thanks to the haptic feedback and adaptive trigger features of the PS5. If you missed out back in April, it’s well worth investing if you’re a fan of dogfights in space, featuring a great loot system that allows you to constantly change your build, new ships to unlock, and a control system that feels like a dream to play.” Everspace 2 is out now for PlayStation, Xbox, and on PC.

Rise of the Ronin is coming to Steam in March,"Koei Tecmo has announced the Team Ninja developed action RPG Rise of the Ronin is coming to PC via Steam on March 11th. Originally a PS5 exclusive, Koei Tecmo has popped the release date just ahead of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which is coming on March 20th. As you’d expect, we’ve got a new trailer to show the PC version off, and the details and PC features as well. Here’s the list of PC features: 8K resolution support DirectX 12 Ultimate support Ultra-wide and super ultra-wide monitor compatibility 120fps support Ray tracing support 3D audio support Customisable keyboard and mouse controls AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution support NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex support UI menu with mouse click ability Intel XeSS graphics technology support The publisher also adds: “Players can now pre-order the game on Steam. Everyone who purchases the game before 2nd April will receive an early purchase bonus which includes four combat styles; Hayabusa-ryu for katana, Hayabusa-ryu for naginata, Nioh-ryu for katana and Aisu Kage-ryu for katana, the Iga Ninja armour set, and the Iga Ninja’s katana.” In our review of the game, we said : “If anything, perhaps Rise of the Ronin is a victim of Team Ninja’s recent success. It falls a little short of the high bar set by Nioh 2, and can’t fully compete with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty in terms of the combat – but perhaps that’s unfair. It balances much of these apparent shortcomings by being more accessible to newcomers and those who seek out this type of world but don’t want to lash themselves to the altar of the Soulslike for forty hours and counting. Step into this world with realistic expectations and there’s a lot of fun to be had, with a decent story, likeable characters, and fluid, satisfying combat. But don’t expect the sophistication of Nioh 2 or the laser focus of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Rise of the Ronin is a solid open world action adventure that rarely puts a foot wrong, but is unlikely to set the world on fire either.” Rise of the Ronin is out now for PS5 and comes to PC via Steam on March 11th.

Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter review,"Tails of Iron was one of the best surprises of 2021, becoming one of my favourite games of the year thanks to its brutal combat and excellent storytelling. Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter has taken that formula and made the sequel just as impressive, with a story that rivals that of Game of Thrones and The Witcher, bringing back combat and making it more responsive and exciting, in a world that is both beautiful and devastating. Who knew that throwing rodents into a dark fantasy setting could be this good? After an epic introduction where your entire home is destroyed by a new threat known as the Dark Wings, Arlo must avenge the death of his father and lead his people as the new Warden of the Wastes. It’s impressive where a game without dialogue can help you warm to characters so well, but I was fully invested in Arlo’s journey, with every new discovery as thrilling as the last. It helps that Doug Cockle, famously the voice of Geralt in The Witcher games, narrates the story throughout, adding a gravitas to proceedings. The world is beautifully hand-drawn, with environments ranging from snowy mountains, dense forests, and ruined towns. Not only does each location have such detail, the characters also have some lovely touches that give them such life. You’ll encounter many different characters and races, but there’re also a ton of enemies and bosses that look stunning. Odd Bug Studio nailed it the first time around, but with Whiskers of Winter, the team has truly outdone itself. The combat is punchier, heavier, and more responsive that it ever has before. While each strike feels weighty and swift, the dodge, parry, and block is more responsive this time around. Some of the bosses are tough to defeat, but you learn their movements and attacks and are able to take advantage of the tight controls to overcome any obstacle. If you do struggle with the difficulty, there is the option to lower it (or raise it if you’re after a tougher challenge), but the middle difficulty offers the perfect balance. Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter offers plenty of opportunities to upgrade your gear and craft new stuff. By killing bigger creatures, you’ll harvest their corpses to get valuable resources. You can build different sets and equip on the fly for different scenarios, too. Some enemies can use poisonous attacks or harness fire and ice to attack, but different armour sets have a resistance to these elemental effects. You can also craft more powerful swords, spears, axes, crossbows, and more to build your perfect arsenal. You can also upgrade your settlement which gives you access to better gear at the blacksmiths, or better food from the kitchen to give you additional buffs. This not only improves Arlo as you venture closer to the Dark Wings, but also offers a sense of community with your people, and makes the stakes feel higher. As I mentioned earlier, you do start to warm to the characters, especially Arlo who I love with all my heart. While some conversations are hard to decipher due to small images appearing in speech bubbles, Lord Cockle makes these interactions easier to understand. You have some side missions available as well, such as monster contracts where you can go and kill some larger creatures and earn resources and gold for doing so. The more effort you put into upgrading, the easier it becomes, but Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is never a walk in the park. You’re challenged with every enemy you come across, as they all have stern attack patterns featuring vicious speed and purpose. Some might find this too much, but I relished the challenge and loved every second. Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is an excellent squeakquel that does everything the first game did but better. Combat is brutal as ever, but the controls are much tighter, and the whetstone is a cool new feature that allows for extra damage to be done. There’re a wealth of weapons, traps, and extra powerful abilities that aid you along the way, and the upgrades give you plenty of options for how you deal with the different types of enemies, monsters, and bosses. With a deep story and some gorgeous environments, this is a wonderful title to play.

Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap review,"Finding a balance of difficulty for playing with friends or solo in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap was something I was hoping would work well because there’s a great challenge trying to find the balance. Of course playing in a group is fun, but there’s still so much enjoyment playing games like this alone. Going into this, I was instantly put at ease as I stepped into my first run and had an absolute blast fighting off the orcs with various traps and some wonderfully built War Mages at my disposal. Going down the rogue-like route, Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap sees you fighting off waves of enemies trying to get into a rift you need to defend. If too many of them pass through, your run is over and its back to your fortress to lick your wounds. The great news is you have so many different traps to lay down, and with so many different characters to play as, you’ll find a balance that works for you. While you do find your rhythm, it never allows you to relax, with each wave more powerful than the last. You start off with money to buy and place a range of traps, such as laser beams that fire from the ceiling, fire pits that burn orcs as they run across them, ripsaws that fire through the air, automated crossbows, launch pads, and many more. After placing the traps you want, it’s time for the wave to begin. Watching the fruits of your labour work and enemies die in hilarious ways while fighting for your life is so exhilarating. When one wave ends, the process is repeated, although you can pick a ‘thread’ that improves your game. They are essentially cards that have a specific power like improving one of your character’s traits, providing more health, or heightening the damage a specific trap might do. The different locations make you think differently when it comes to placing traps. Inside the castle, you’ll have plenty of walls and low ceilings, but out in the courtyard the open air won’t let you place those powerful laser beams, so every location offers environmental challenges for you to contend with. The further you go, the tougher the enemies become. They get bigger and more powerful, but there’s also more variety of what you have to contend with, along with those flying bastards that help heal the enemy. While you do have a wide range of traps (with more to be unlocked and upgraded between runs back in your fortress), the different War Mages offer different ways to play and approach. While I enjoyed playing as Wren due to her wand dealing relatively powerful blasts from her wand and an ability that triggers nearby traps, I fell in love with Sophie; a cat with a penchant for necromancy. Soph has dual blades that rip through orcs up close, as well as throwing from a distance. Each War Mage has an Overdrive ability that works like an Ultimate in Overwatch , and hers allows the summoning of her undead knight Bartholomew, who joins the field of play to fight alongside her. While there are War Mages in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, some of them have a focus on healing and support, and that’s where playing with others gets exciting. All War Mages have their own specialised traps and traits. Kalos is a druid bear that can heal allies while fighting, and his ‘trap’ provides healing berries when interacted with. His trait is a second health bar that means his support becomes a vital member of any team. Mac is another great support character who uses his engineering skills to slow down enemies and use his knowledge of enemies and traps to improve the damage done. Each can play a great role in teams, but they’re also strong alone, with Robot Entertainment finding a solid balance regardless as who you play as. This balance also plays into the difficulty. The amount of enemies are scaled depending on whether you are on your own or not. When you first start playing, it is rather difficult to progress far, but each character has a skill tree which you can improve every aspect of their game, and back at base you’re able to unlock a ton of new traps and upgrade how powerful they or or how much quicker they reset. You’re rewarded for the more time you put in, and I really started to find my feet once I began learning the environments and improving my characters of choice. Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap is such an exciting game to play. Fighting off the waves of enemies all featuring different buffs, debuffs, and attack patterns, as well as randomised threads make each run different from the last. It’s fun playing alone, but battling the hordes of creatures with others is where this is going to be at its best. With tons of upgrades and new traps to unlock, the gameplay is always exciting, and while it can be hard defending the rift when waves increase in difficulty, it is always thrilling to fight the various creatures you face.

Hyper Light Breaker update adds a Medkit rework,"Developer Heart Machine has released a fairly significant update for early access title, Hyper Light Breaker , reworking the medkit system. The biggest change, really, is that you actually start with one now. Previously, the original early access build would require you to do a full cycle of the roguelike action (at least four deaths) to gain a currency to unlock a medkit, and you’d have to grab a specific item each run to increase your chance of starting the next run with one in your inventory. You’d also need to replenish at Shrines with this same item. As you can see from the changes below, the community has spoken, and Heart Machine has listened: Players now start with a Medkit. The first Medkit upgrade available via Pherus Bit now improves Medkits. Medkits now auto-refill on launch of run, up to max capacity (default 1, upgradeable to 2). Medkit refills at Shrines are now paid for with Bright Blood, not Medigems. Medigems still provide a small amount of health still when harvested, but are no longer used for Medikits or used in the end-of-cycle screen. Basically this means you will always start with a medkit now, which makes the game far more manageable. Here’s some more of the changes in the latest update: COMMUNITY SUGGESTION: Removed the tech croc brute and white dirks from the extraction spawn table. COMMUNITY SUGGESTION: Increased time between waves of additional enemies in Crown fights. Projectiles from weak enemies no longer hit-stun the player. Flinch animations will play, but the player will have full control. Previously they played a hit impact that momentarily interrupted them. Fixed an issue where damage trails would cause hit-stun on contact. Enemy aggro distance reduced. Removed some enemies from the Drop Down Lab spawns that weren’t supposed to be spawning there (or at all). The team adds : “As a studio, this has been our most ambitious project yet – making an open world roguelite (which there aren’t that many out there!) — and so, we’re beyond thrilled to make our vision for Hyper Light Breaker a reality alongside you all throughout the course of Early Access. We made Hyper Light Breaker with Early Access in mind to have it grow and evolve with our community, and today’s patch represents that as we made some pretty big changes, including a rework on Medkits, thanks to your feedback.” Hyper Light Breaker is in early access on Steam, now.

The First Berserker: Khazan demo-exclusive trailer released,"Nexon has released the trailer that you see when you finish the demo for The First Berserker: Khazan , showing more of the game off ahead of release. Until now it was exclusive to that demo, meaning you had to finish the demo to see it. The trailer shows off plenty of combat, some huge enemy fights, and some story moments, it seems. The demo was released on January 16th, and hit the top spot for Steam demos. Check out the trailer, below: The First Berserker: Khazan is a hardcore action RPG based on the Dungeon Fighter Online (DnF) universe, Nexon’s flagship IP with more than 800 million players worldwide. Set 800 years before the events of DnF, the game unfolds on the continent of Arad and explores the untold story of Khazan, the first Berserker. Players will experience Khazan’s legendary journey firsthand as they master intricate and engaging combat mechanics and strategic battles that bring his epic tale to life. The First Berserker: Khazan captures the essence of Dungeon Fighter Online with its blend of flashy hack-and-slash combat and hardcore difficulty, delivering polished, high-impact action. Intense boss battles maximize tension, while hard-earned victories provide a deep sense of accomplishment, offering players a thrilling combat experience. In the 89th year of the Pell Los Empire, the Great General Khazan is falsely accused of treason and banished to the snowy mountains. Having narrowly escaped death, Khazan embarks on a quest for vengeance. Witness his growth as he uncovers the conspiracies that led to his downfall, masters lost combat skills, and unveils the truth about the empire. The Steam page says that each weapon comes with “a variety of skills that can be combined to create a combat style that’s entirely your own”. On top of that, you can dual-wield weapons, as well as upgrade them. The First Berserker: Khazan is coming to PC , Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 on March 25th.

Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection review,"There is no escaping the fact that Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection is heavily inspired by a certain first party Nintendo franchise, in particular the Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom experiences. It doesn’t so much wear its influences on its sleeve, moreover it screams them from the rooftops with a megaphone whilst cosplaying as Link. The stamina bar, the look of the main character, even some of the runic insignia encountered in the roguelike dungeons look eerily Hyrule-esque. But this 3D remake of the previously pixelated dungeon crawler is a different and (probably obviously) inferior beast to the aforementioned classics. You take on the role of Tama, who is on an emotionally driven quest to revive her beloved friend Koko. It is the excellent story and anime styled cutscenes that are by far and away the strongest part of Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection. The opening animated movie is truly stunning, and the artwork employed during the vignettes and static storyline panels is of exceptional quality. Whilst the gameplay loop is extremely similar to the original, the transition to 3D adds a different feel and now employs a bit of platforming. There are unlockable boss rush and challenge modes too, and the ability to play local co-op. The core experience sees you move through a series of stages, fighting enemies and seeking loot, and once you obtain the titular sword you are able to resurrect and summon defeated foes to summon and fight alongside you in combat, with up to three critters being stashed at one time and dragged into the fray with a button press. In theory this is a great system and we have seen things like this employed to great effect in titles like Ni No Kuni, or the sublime Pawn system in the Dragon’s Dogma series. The problem here is that in spite of the diverse menagerie of Zelda/Dragon Quest-esque characters, in practice they often find it tough to keep up with Tama, being left behind or trapped as you work your way through the twisting dungeon maps. I also had times where they did not respond correctly to commands, for example being asked to sit on a spot to solve an environmental switch-based puzzle. There are also some irritating moments where you have to sacrifice one of your team of monsters as there are puzzles that can only be passed when you summon a particular type of enemy in your party. Combat overall is also rather dull. A 3D action platformer can live or die by the dynamism and feel of its fighting system, and most enemies can be given an easy leathering by just pressing the same button over and over. There are a decent variety of weapon types and also tools which include things like a bow and arrow to hit distant foes or switches. A rudimentary crafting system seems to be fairly underused, as I was able to progress quite easily without bothering to upgrade by standard sword and spear arsenal too often. In stark contrast to the lovely cutscenes, Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection is a drab looking experience, visually. I get the idea and commitment to providing a retro aesthetic, but the environments are far from inspiring to look at and resemble a blocky 3D platformer from a bygone era, and not in a good way. There are plenty of achievements, and some tricksy challenges to be completed on each new stage you encounter, such as finishing a stage in a set time, or clearing a section only using your sword attack, and these add a bit of longevity to proceedings but this one isn’t going to last you too long before you either defeat it or lose interest. There was much promise to Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection, and it does have a charming and heartfelt story, but if you really want to play something of this ilk then you are better served taking your business elsewhere with one of the titles I have mentioned earlier, as aside from the aforementioned visuals, it just doesn’t quite hit the mark across the board.

Riki 8Bit Game Collection review,"RIKI 8bit Game Collection is less an actual videogame, but more a piece of audio-visual art; it uses the medium of retro-modern twitchy 8 bit media (think WarioWare , or even Game & Watch, reimagined inside a 1980s Japanese arcade) to flesh out what is essentially a canny collection of high-quality chiptune music, all wrapped up in the stunning anime/Manga aesthetic of the talented and creative RIKI, whose name and logo is proudly emblazoned all over the place. The two actual “games” included in this collection are very basic affairs, and serve more as a medium to deliver the array of exceptional aural delights. Astro Ninja Man DX is a simplistic Space Invaders clone where you control the titular ninjutsu along the bottom of the screen and use a standard projectile weapon and a more destructive laser to destroy myriad foes and debris that cascade down from above. Like everything about RIKI 8bit Game Collection, there is a surreal and hallucinatory feel to this one, with some wild art design both on screen and incorporated into the arcade cab style bezels alongside. Kira Kira Star Night (Reach for the Stars) sees you take on the role of textbook wide-eyed anime lass Kira who can leap into the air and collect the stars that swarm around the screen, all set to more of the great music, and drawn in a very Japanese, synthwave fever dream style, all neon pinks and blues, with cassette motifs and brightly lit cityscapes. The remaining three selectable segments are basically interactive chiptune albums that you can play with to your heart’s content. I cannot stress how many big hitters are involved in what RIKI has curated here. Yuzo Koshiro should need no introduction, but I will say that he was responsible for sound-tracking some of my all-time favourite titles, in particular Streets of Rage and ActRaiser . If, like me, you are partial to a classic vertical shmup, then Manabu Namiki should also make your ears prick up, thanks to their craft on all-timers like Battle Garegga. Manami Matsumae (Rockman/Mega Man), and Soichi Terada (the slept-on Ape Escape) are also part of the line up. I must stress that this is more of a fully interactive way of listening to a superb chiptune album. It is the video game medium equivalent of back in the day when Funkmaster Flex would put out his compilation CDs featuring the hottest acts in hip hop freestyling and dropping little snippets that you hadn’t heard before, and is a novel and admirable way to deliver new music. The games are kind of on the periphery here, and this will not be for everyone – there is a niche market for this aesthetic and sound – however I cannot deny that it thoroughly appeals to me and is going to be firmly in the wheelhouse of many in the still thriving retro game community. As such, beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder, but for sheer force of will and commitment to the art, and the panache with which this has been executed, Riki 8Bit Game Collection deserves a tremendous amount of credit.

IDUN – Frontline Survival review,"Tower Defence is a genre I’ve always played sporadically, and usually only when it’s bolted onto the side of something else. It’s rare that I ever get into the nitty gritty of tower defence in its purest form. I prefer a narrative, or at the very least some form of character progression like an RPG or Metroidvania . But IDUN – Frontline Survival surprised me with just how quickly it sucked me in. Primarily, you play as Ham, a gruff but snarky security officer whose job it is to oversee the defence of a mostly automated mining operation on the planet Idun. Aided by his daughter Ro-ro and a handful of unlockable allies, Ham is often the guy in the thick of the action when deadly alien vermin begin attacking the operation from every direction. Ham is just one guy, and will be swarmed in seconds without the aid of equipment deployed via orbital drop. Turrets, flamethrowers, towers and upgrades can be called down, earned with material you pull out of the ground during the mission. The action is fast, the deployment instant, the gratification immediate. But that’s not the cool part. The cool part is that none of your placements are permanent. Just as you can move Ham and his allies around to fill gaps in your defences, you can also move turrets and other items at zero cost and with no wait times. Too many bugs amassing to the east? Drop your turrets there while Ham and his buddies finish off stragglers to the west. In between, you can use a powerful “sky gun” to obliterate enemies in real-time to give your guys on the ground some help. Periodically you’ll receive golden packages you can click on to get new upgrades, more guns, or boosts and buffs, and as missions are often short and frantic you’ll need to use everything. IDUN is designed to be challenging, and taking your eye off the ball for even a few seconds will see you overrun. Other characters soon join you, such as sharpshooter Rayne and melee-focused Q, and with them comes more of a focus on narrative. IDUN – Frontline Survival exists in quite a fleshed-out universe, and the colourful, well-drawn characters reflect this universe. They mostly squabble, but also exposit plenty, and build the world. It’s a good-looking game too. The mission levels aren’t super detailed but they do run the gamut of alien landscapes. The character portraits during conversations are gorgeous though. It also sounds pretty good, with fully voiced dialogue and some great sound effects. It’s quite satisfying to slam turrets into the ground and mow down hordes of giant bugs with the sky-gun. IDUN is seriously frantic at times though. It barely gives you a moment to think once an onslaught begins, and while it’s really fun to micromanage the defence in this way, it can get stressful. Once you start losing turrets it’s hard to unlock replacements fast enough, and repairs aren’t always an option. As I said, it’s challenging by design, and the higher the difficulty you choose per mission, the better the rewards you’ll earn. These rewards are then used to unlock various upgrades to your defences, research new items, and level up your characters and their gear. The between-mission hub allows you to spend resources in any way you choose, though you won’t spend a great deal of time there. It’s interesting to note that IDUN also plays really well on Steam Deck despite not being verified at time of writing. The small screen can make it tricky to read some of the dialogue, but it runs really smoothly and is easy to control even when in the thick of the action. IDUN – Frontline Survival is an interesting take on the tower defence genre with likeable characters and a fun story. It’s quite unique in its mechanics, which keeps it feeling fresh throughout. It’s not super easy though, so be prepared for a little frustration as you get to grips with it.

White Knuckle to be published by DreadXP,"Indie publisher DreadXP teams with developer Dark Machine Games to bring first-person speed climbing horror White Knuckle to fans. The game is set in a huge underground megastructure that features intense action, intricate momentum-based movement mechanics, and survival horror. To celebrate the announcement, a trailer has been released to give players an idea of what to expect. Thrust into the role of a lone climber, players must attempt to ascend SUB-STRUCTURE 17, an enormous, crumbling complex buried deep underground. With ten thousand meters of concrete and decay above and an encroaching ooze below, every climb is a race against time. Navigate perilous environments, using a blend of precision movement, sharp reflexes, and resource management to scale deteriorating walls, leap across perilous gaps, dodge traps, and avoid the deadly forces lurking in the shadows. White Knuckle will task players with managing a limited inventory so they don’t become encumbered as they climb the creepy structures of SUB-STRUCTURE 17. Resource management and quick thinking are going to be just two of the factors players are going to have to think about as obstacles become tougher to overcome the higher they climb, with each new threat offering a host of challenges. Evil exists throughout the terrifying structure as the environment becomes more and more hostile, forcing players to continually change their approach and strategies to stay alive. From the dry, dusty Silos to the putrid sewers of the Pipeworks and the haunted piers of Habitation, each area presents a distinct set of trials and enemies, all contributing to a sense of ever-growing tension. Run, jump, and climb to survive… or slip and face your doom. Every leap could be the last and it’s a long way down… White Knuckle will be launching on Early Access via Steam later this year, but players wanting to play a little earlier can now dive into the demo, already featuring over 1,000 overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam. .

GameSir G7 HE Iron Man Limited Edition Controller review,"If you’re after reliable, well-made and, above all, affordable controllers for PC or console, you can’t really do better than GameSir. The GameSir G7 HE Iron Man Limited Edition Controller, for example, is not only well-priced for a special edition pad, it’s also really well put-together too. It is a wired model, so if that’s a deal-breaker for you when it comes to handing over £60 for a controller, you’re best off looking elsewhere. But if you don’t mind plug-and-play and you’re looking for a stunning piece of kit sporting the branding of everyone’s favourite iron-clad billionaire, you could do worse. Gleaming gold and hot rod red may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but the audacious colour scheme is absolutely gorgeous in the right set-up. A gold-embossed Iron Man emblazons the right palm grip, with the symbol of Tony Stark’s unique mini-reactor on the left. Though, the G7 HE isn’t all about the looks. It also features some really nice quality-of-life stuff under the hood that will make a difference to die-hard gamers. For a start, it boasts Hall Effect thumbsticks and triggers, which make it practically immune to ever developing stick-drift. It doesn’t feature an omni-directional D-pad, so fight fans might be put off, but there’s built-in haptic feedback that you can adjust and customise using GameSir’s own Nexus app. This also allows you to customise the extra buttons and set up your own shortcuts. A 3.5mm mic jack lets you play sound through the controller, with a microphone switch baked in. In my hands, the G7 HE Iron Man controller feels weighty but comfortable. I’d rather a controller have some heft to it, and the 227g G7 HE doesn’t feel “heavy”, but doesn’t feel insignificant either. The buttons feel just springy enough, but the sticks themselves are the real MVPs. Hall Effect is one thing, but they feel so smooth and frictionless that playing fast-paced games like shooters is a joy. CHECK IT OUT: GameSir Tarantula Pro Controller | Review Bundled with a 9-foot cable, the G7 HE Iron Man Controller competes well with wired options, though certain other features seem somewhat superfluous at the time of writing. For example, you can remove the faceplate to replace it was something else, but at this point I can’t find other options. Although I’m an Iron Man fan so I can’t imagine doing that anyway. Ultimately, stunning aesthetic aside, the G7 HE Iron Man controller is still a fantastic gamepad. For £60 you’re not only getting a unique-looking pad, you’re also getting something that feels responsive, well-made, sturdy, and reliable. The wire might be an issue for some, but if you overlook that, it’s a solid option for PC, Switch, or Xbox gamers.

Press Start’s GOTY #8 – Dispatch,"It’s time for our annual countdown to award the very best games this year had to offer. Over the next ten days, we’ll count down our top ten games of 2025. As always, the votes of each Press Start team member, weighted from #10 through to #1, were collated to compile our collective very best for the year that was. Games worthy of one’s top spot would be awarded a maximum of 10 points, and the values would descend to their tenth selection, which would receive a single point. About a decade ago, nobody did narrative-adventure quite like Telltale Games. With their takes on Robert Kirkman’s The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, they solidified themselves as a household name in the video games industry, delivering story and character work the likes of which we’d rarely seen, all within the framework of a ‘choose your own adventure’ plot. The Icarus-like course they’d charted for themselves would eventually see them burn up, and from their ashes would rise AdHoc, an upstart from developers who’d spent time at Ubisoft, Night School, and, of course, Telltale. They faced adversity throughout their formation as a studio, struggling to secure funding, which led the founders to forgo paychecks for six months to keep the staff afloat. Dispatch would eventually launch to the raving of critics, proving to be a success for the team. Ad Hoc proved, in one fell swoop, that there’s still an appetite for episodic, narrative adventures if they’re done right. They delivered on their planned release schedule and served up a story that left players thirsting for more week-to-week. Courtesy of having a surprisingly high-profile cast, including the likes of Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright, it’s uncertain whether Dispatch will ever see a second season, but we’re so bloody lucky to have been given the game we got. Harry Says “Undoubtedly my sleeper hit for the year, Dispatch is a near flawless first showing from AdHoc Studio. Despite occupying a subgenre of superhero media that’s become slightly less novel, Dispatch feels anything but tired or uninspired. Impeccable writing, tight pacing, and an endlessly lovable cast of characters will have you locked in for its seven-to-eight-hour runtime. It’s genuinely funny, impossibly moreish, and the best example of how episodic storytelling can work in video games.” In our review, Brodie scored Dispatch a 9.5 out of 10 , stating: “Courtesy of an excellent, funny, and heartfelt superhero story that peeks at life behind the mask, Dispatch has made a late charge at the year’s top gong with a scintillating and near flawless eight-episode run, all the while bettering even Telltale’s hallowed best.” On the review aggregator Metacritic, Dispatch is resting at an average of 89. Congratulations to AdHoc for earning a place in our top ten for 2025.

Press Start’s GOTY #9 – BALL x PIT,"It’s time for our annual countdown to award the very best games this year had to offer. Over the next ten days, we’ll count down our top ten games of 2025. As always, the votes of each Press Start team member, weighted from #10 through to #1, were collated to compile our collective very best for the year that was. Games worthy of one’s top spot would be awarded a maximum of 10 points, and the values would descend to their tenth selection, which would receive a single point. BALL x PIT was, for all intents and purposes, this year’s Balatro. A wildly ambitious and novel take on the roguelike fad that took ideas from Arkanoid, Vampire Survivors, among others, and mashed them together with several other notions, like city-building, to create the year’s most moreish, crack-like game. What I appreciated most about BALL x PIT, as a roguelike, is how respectful it is of your time; whether you finish the run or not doesn’t matter, you will return to base with something to do. Nothing is ever lost. BALL x PIT was an enormous success for developer Kenny Sun, going on to sell over a million copies after selling 300,000 within its first week. The game is a mix of calm and chaotic, as the tranquil city-building and resource harvesting stand in direct opposition to the bonkers, bullet hell action you’re forced to endure in an effort to rebuild Ballbylon. The game stands as proof that some old ideas, some as simple as the brick-shattering action of Breakout, can stand the test of time and be desired once again; all it takes is a little twist. James Says “From the second I played BALL x PIT, it had me. Plenty of games are taking a swing at the roguelite formula, but this one stands out through sheer simplicity and that devilishly moreish “just one more run” allure that it so perfectly encapsulates. That’s before you even get to the base management, which almost works as a game in its own right. It doesn’t distract from the loop; it deepens it, adding a satisfying layer of progression to the already addictive gameplay loop Kenny Sun and his team has put together. What really seals it is how BALL x PIT teases you to break it wide open. Between the wild variety of balls and the confidently stylish art and music, it comes together as something that genuinely doesn’t feel like anything else.” In our review, Brodie scored BALL x PIT a 9 out of 10 , stating: “BALL x PIT is an unexpectedly addictive roguelike that throws a few well-worn ideas into a pot to meld them into something bizarre, captivating, and unique. While there’s a rhythm to firing, fusing, and evolving balls that’s moreish and hard to put down, things like the city-building complement the package so well, it’s the ultimate “one more run” game. And just like the balls you’ll spend hours branding the enemy with, you’ll keep coming back again, and again, and again.” On the review aggregator Metacritic, BALL x PIT is resting at an average of 84. Congratulations to Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital for earning a place in our top ten for 2025. Game of the Year 2025 #10 – Ghost of Yotei #9 – BALL x PIT The post Press Start’s GOTY #9 – BALL x PIT appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-22T23:00:29+00:00,Brodie Gibbons,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/12/23/press-starts-goty-9-ball-x-pit/
Press Start’s GOTY #10 – Ghost of Yotei,"It’s time for our annual countdown to award the very best games this year had to offer. Over the next ten days, we’ll count down our top ten games of 2025. As always, the votes of each Press Start team member, weighted from #10 through to #1, were collated to compile our collective very best for the year that was. Games worthy of one’s top spot would be awarded a maximum of 10 points, and the values would descend to their tenth selection, which would receive a single point. Following up a sublime Samurai odyssey like Ghost of Tsushima was always going to be a monumental task; however, Sucker Punch did just that this year, releasing Ghost of Yotei. The game was lauded for being a much more varied experience, while maintaining the touchstone beauty and romance of Feudal Japan.Like the original, Yotei feels like a classic Samurai movie, nailing the trademark tones of revenge within its unforgiving and punishing world. Structurally, it does resemble Ubisoft’s first meaningful leap into the world of Japanese mythology with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, as Atsu seeks revenge against the Yotei Six, who murdered her family, razed her village, and left her for dead; the obvious similarity didn’t hurt Ghost of Yotei ultimately, though, as the game would go on to sell millions and be nominated in seven categories at The Game Awards; although it wouldn’t go on to win any. Ghost of Tsushima, in its own right, placed second in our Game of the Year back in 2020 , falling short of a little game called The Last of Us Part II. While its sequel rounds out our top ten, it’s not because it’s any less of a game; Ghost of Yotei is another spectacular open-world that is a marked improvement over its predecessor in most areas, perhaps only struggling narratively courtesy of its more open, non-linear structure. Josh Says “Ghost of Yotei improves on its predecessor in every facet, with Atsu’s thirst for revenge unravelling rather than building this time around. The vistas are even more breathtaking, and the combat is streamlined yet increasingly varied; however, the strongest leap forward was how well-paced the journey ultimately was. I loved hunting through every corner of Yotei, eavesdropping in taverns, rescuing farmers, and overlapping your prey’s trail of blood with your own. Jumping between Atsu’s childhood and her current state gives weight to her actions during your time hunting the Yotei Six, making her motivation and rage clear. Characters provide not just tools to complete the next objective but also showcase another aspect of why Atsu refuses to set aside her quest for revenge, even if she ends up dead alongside the man who took her family. The little wolf can run for only so long until she ends up in a pack without realising, or even accepting it.” In our review, Harry scored Ghost of Yotei an 8.5 out of 10 , stating: “While I don’t think Ghost of Yotei quite reaches the heights of its predecessor, it is another worthwhile trip to a lawless Japan. It sports a tonally distinct and cinematic story, a visually diverse open world chock full of activities, and is another fantastic showcase for the power of the PlayStation 5.” Our Ghost of Yotei Review Discussion — The Press Start Podcast On the review aggregator Metacritic, Ghost of Yotei is resting at an average of 86. Congratulations to Sucker Punch for earning a place in our top ten for 2025.

Tekken’s Katsuhiro Harada Is Leaving Bandai Namco,"It looks like it’s the final round for Tekken’s Chief Producer and Game Director, with Katsuhiro Harada announcing on X (formerly Twitter) that he will be stepping down from his role at Bandai Namco, and departing the company. In his post on the 8th of December 2025, coincidentally the last day of Tekken’s 30th Anniversary, Harada announced; “I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.” Harada has been a mainstay of the Tekken series since its early days, cutting his teeth in Namco’s arcade business and voicing the characters of Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu, before stepping into the directors’ seat for Tekken 3. From here, he continued to help the franchise grow and expand, reaching a General Manager position within Bandai Namco while overseeing the Tekken project. “Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.” Tekken’s latest instalment – Tekken 8 – was the first mainline game not to receive an arcade release prior to launch, due to COVID-19 and the changing landscape of the arcade scene in Japan. Tekken 8 managed to surpass 3 million copies faster than its predecessor Tekken 7. Hilariously, Harada’s extensive engagement with the Tekken community on X (formerly Twitter) led to his famous catch phrase “Don’t ask me for shit!” when hounded by fans for not including features or characters in Tekken. While initially borne out of frustration with the fans for being rude, this became incorporated into his appearances, including wearing a shirt during Tekken Talk, and quoting it at The Game Awards when receiving an award for Tekken 8. Harada will still appear as a special guest at the TWT World Finals in 2026. It will definitely be interesting to see where the franchise goes next without a stalwart such as Harada at the helm.

New Grand Theft Auto 6 Animations Have Seemingly Appeared Online,"A Reddit user has spotted a showreel from an animator who has worked for Rockstar Games for some times, and within the showreel is seemingly animations for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6. The video has now been taken offline, but is featured below (or here) and shows off two scenes that are seemingly from Grand Theft Auto 6. The first shows a character taking a bike from a rental stand and then returning the bike to the stand in great detail. This one is pretty significant as in addition to seeing the animation, it seemingly confirms rental bikes in Grand Theft Auto 6. The second video shows a female character (seemingly protagonist Lucia) getting off a pickup truck and working her way around it in great detail, which again, shows off some seemingly impressive animations. Otherwise in the showreel are cuts from Red Dead Redemption 2, Max Payne 3 as well as Grand Theft Auto 5. Grand Theft Auto 6 is set to release on November 19th, 2026 after being delayed with Rockstar citing that it would need “additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve” The post New Grand Theft Auto 6 Animations Have Seemingly Appeared Online appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-01T23:52:30+00:00,Shannon Grixti,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2025/12/02/new-grand-theft-auto-6-animations-have-seemingly-appeared-online/

Games Coming Out In December 2025 That You Should Be Excited For,"I learned from last month not to include Sarah Connor in this month’s banner, but I swear, if Terminator 2D: No Fate gets delayed again? In any case, it’s time to round out what has been a pretty grand year, and December is unsurprisingly bringing a few bangers which I’m sure we’ll be discussing at this time next year when deliberating on Game of the Year nominations.

Target Has A Cracking Donkey Kong Bananza Deal For One Day Only,"The Black Friday deals have been slowly rolling out over the last two weeks in a way that is harder to keep track of than ever before, but Target has been dropping some banger deals and there’s none better than the one today. It has Donkey Kong Bananza for $69 for one day only which is $40 off for what is my personal game of the year so far. You can grab it right HERE. Donkey Kong Bananza – $69 from Target In our review, we gave Donkey Kong Bananza a 10/10 and said: “With Donkey Kong Bananza, DK is back in a big way. It blends new tech with old-school Nintendo charm for a destructive experience that is both intoxicating and addictive. While Pauline’s storyline is underdeveloped, this is easily Donkey Kong at his absolute best. Regardless of some minor blemishes, Donkey Kong Bananza deserves a place in any self-respecting Switch 2 owner’s library and, much like Super Mario Odyssey before it, sets an incredibly high bar for all that will follow.” The post Target Has A Cracking Donkey Kong Bananza Deal For One Day Only appeared first on Press Start .",2025-11-27T22:07:51+00:00,Shannon Grixti,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/bargains/2025/11/28/target-has-a-cracking-donkey-kong-bananza-deal-for-one-day-only/

The New PS5 Slim Model Has Arrived In Australia With Less Storage And An All Matte Design,"UPDATE : The new Digital PS5 Slim has now arrived in Australia with its lesser 825GB of storage and all matte design and is listed on Amazon , EB Games and JB Hi-Fi . It’s the same price at $749.95 but will be significantly discounted later this week (to $500 and below). ORIGINAL STORY: A new Digital PS5 Slim Model is rolling out to all territories with some significant changes, and YouTuber Austin Evans has got his hands on a model. Whilst this isn’t an update that is being publicized and will seemingly come in at the same price, there are external and internal changes to the new model. The largest one externally is the fact that instead of the top portion being glossy and the bottom matte, the PS5 Slim now has all matte faceplates. The original PS5 Slim SSD was upgraded to 1TB (from 825GB on the original PS5) but that has once again been downgraded to 825GB. The new PS5 Slim is also about 120 grams lighter due to a redesigned heat sink structure made of thinner metal, although this doesn’t seem to have an impact on the power consumption or temperature that the console operates at. This new model has already rolled out in Europe, and whilst there are no reports of it arriving in Australia yet (we normally get new PS5 models first), it can’t be long before this starts replacing the current 1TB Slim. If you’re wanting a PS5 Slim 1TB, it’s currently down to $699 on Amazon ($130 off), so it’s actually a good time to jump in and grab one.

Resident Evil Requiem Won’t Support Mouse Mode On Nintendo Switch 2,"Following it’s surprise reveal for Nintendo Switch 2 in the September 2025 Nintendo Direct, I was intrigued to know just how the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil Requiem stands up to other versions. While there are obvious changes to the visual fidelity that comes with running the game off less powerful hardware, I was intrigued by what else the game would do with the Switch 2’s unique hardware. At a recent preview, I had some hands-on time with the game, playing the Sanitarium demo that you’ve no doubt seen around the internet. But I was also able to get some one-on-one time with the producer of the game, Masato Kumazawa, who has previously worked on the Resident Evil 4 remake and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess . When I asked Kumazawa-san about if there were any challenges unique to development of the Switch 2, he insisted there wasn’t. On the topic, he said: “Looking back on Switch, there were Resident Evil games before on the Switch, so what we did, is we used the past experience of developing these games on the Switch to help develop Nintendo Switch 2. But also, we made a lot of versions of the games for PC as well. In fitting with PCs that have a wide variety of specs, we could also just make sure the game was optimised for the Nintendo Switch 2 too. So it wasn’t too hard, so to speak.” Of course, this lead me to ask if there were any Switch-specific functionality that they could confirm for me. Surprisingly, there was. Kumazawa-san said: “Actually, we tried really hard to implement mouse controls for Nintendo Switch 2. When we put it in, it confused the gameplay and became too complicated. So actually, we are using gyro instead.” It’s worth mentioning that while we can assume there will be amiibo support of some kind for the Switch 2 version utilising the brand new Grace Ashcroft amiibo, we still don’t know how this will work. While the game is less than three months away, a Resident Evil showcase is scheduled for early 2026, which will provide a more detailed look at the game. Beyond that, we’ll have to wait. Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27th 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. The author travelled to Sydney, Australia, as a guest of Capcom and Five Star Distribution.

Resident Evil Requiem Hands-On Preview – Short But Sweet,"Resident Evil was one of the first series I was fully invested in, when I picked up my first-ever game at the tender age of eight. I assumed it would be fine, but wasn’t ready for what would follow. That game was Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, and it informed many of my tastes, including my penchant for horror. To think the series has been going for almost three decades is nothing short of astounding. Even more remarkable is that, despite having watched and consumed every piece of media available for Resident Evil Requiem, I still found a few surprises when I played it this week. And while Capcom is still coy about how the game will play outside of what I’ve played, it sets a good scene for where Requiem is headed. The preview opens with newcomer Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from the Outbreak games, waking up to find herself suspended upside down in a gurney. Her blood is being collected for some reason, but she obviously doesn’t want to stick around to find out why. Letting herself free, Grace, armed with nothing but her fear, sets out to escape what appears to be a sanatorium. However, it’s not that simple, and things can become quite hectic quite quickly. From the outset, while the demo is light on story details or even the combat the series is traditionally known for, it’s clear that Resident Evil Requiem is trying to do something different. While the idea of darkness in a horror game is hardly anything new , games haven’t played with the concept of light and dark like Requiem appears to be doing. The way the tension is built is masterfully done – I was genuinely worried to turn the light on in a room for fear of what I might see. Of course, the game uses statues and furniture to trick you into seeing things that aren’t actually there, too. But no more does this become more evident than with the new creature that Requiem throws at you a few minutes into your exploration. This is a new type of enemy in the game, and it is unlike anything the games have thrown at me before. I tried my hardest to trick or outsmart the AI of this creature, which towers over Grace, but it feels pretty intelligent overall. It’s scared of light, which will presumably have some story explanation later, but it does everything it can to work out where you are when you’re hiding, and sometimes even removes hiding places too. It reminds me of Alien Isolation , though I am sure that as the game progresses, it will begin to resemble the games that came before it, like 7 and Village . Grace herself moves rather slowly, however, which is an intentional design choice. Though interestingly, she moves differently depending on which viewpoint you are playing the game from. Requiem is a first for the series in that it allows you to play either first or third person at any point. First-person is a lot more tense and easier to get immersed in. The third-person perspective feels like more recent Resident Evil remakes, but it removes some of the tension. That tension is added back into the mix by making Grace a bit more trippy and fumbly when playing in third-person, but the horror is overall a lot milder, as you can see a lot more. The actual demo itself was simple, reminding me a lot of the early demos for both Resident Evil 7 and Village . You explore a location, avoid a monster, and find some items that’ll help you escape. It’s not quite the management of inventory that you’d expect, but it’s evident that’s coming at some point after this demo ends anyway. There were also not many puzzles (actually, there weren’t any), but again, I am sure this will come once Grace is released from the sanatorium and left to her own devices. It’s hard to comment on what else Requiem has in store, as the demo we played is intentionally vague. What I have played is really all I can comment on, and so far, I think that while the “stalker” enemy type is growing a bit long in the tooth, this does feel dynamic and different enough to separate itself from other pursuers like Lady Dimitrescu, Nemesis and Mr. X. But there’s still a lot for Requiem to prove, and hopefully, Capcom will detail more soon to satiate a fanbase that is growing nothing short of ravenous. However, given how vague Resident Evil 7 was before its release, and how that game ultimately turned out, I have complete confidence in the team bringing this game to life. The way Requiem is already committed to evolving series staples is more than enough assurance that, as Capcom says, Resident Evil Requiem will scare us in new and exciting ways when it releases in February. Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27th 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S.

A Death Stranding Animated Series Is Being Produced For Disney Plus,"Kojima Productions has announced that, in addition to the previously announced live-action and animated films, an animated TV series based on Death Stranding is being produced, with an expected release in 2027 on Disney+. It’s expected to be presented in “traditional, hand-drawn 2D animation” and to follow an entirely new story within the game’s world. It’s expected to explore the story of a yet-to-be-named man and woman in North America. The show’s synopsis reads: “Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way.” Hideo Kojima will serve as the series’ executive producer, while it’ll be helmed by Takayuki Sano. His previous works include Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, and Jujutsu Kaisen 0. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was released this year to critical acclaim ; however, through endeavours such as the Strands of Harmony world tour, which brought music from the games to a live audience, and the aforementioned films, which are in production, the IP is certainly evolving product-to-product.

Fallout’s Second Season Just Got An Explosive New Trailer,"Amazon’s Fallout TV series enjoyed ample success with its first season, and with the second season just over a month away, Amazon has released the first full trailer for the explosive follow-up set within New Vegas. The second season, set to come to Amazon Prime on December 17, sees the return of stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, and Walton Goggins as they band together to survive the wastelands.

An Official PlayStation Monitor With A Built-In DualSense Charging Hook Has Been Revealed,"PlayStation has today announced an official PlayStation monitor. It’s 27-inches in size, has a 1440p resolution, a 240hz refresh rate (120hz maximum when connected to PS5) and VRR support. What’s more interesting though is the fact that it features as swiveling DualSense controller charging hook so that you can keep your controller charged and ready to go below your monitors at all time. The sad news is that it’s only coming to the US and Japan at this stage, which is in-line with all of Sony’s other gaming monitors in its InZONE brand, although given this one is an official PlayStation accessory, we’re more hopeful that it will come to Australia. Here’s how it’s described on the PlayStation blog: “The 27″” Gaming Monitor with DualSense® Charging Hook features a QHD screen with HDR visuals*, up to 240 Hz refresh rate* with VRR support* for smooth gameplay, and a convenient DualSense® wireless controller charging hook to keep you ready for action anytime.

The Nintendo Switch 2 Is Selling Even Better Than Expected,"Nintendo has released its latest financial results and to not a heap of shock, the Nintendo Switch 2 is selling extremely well. In its first two quarters on sale, the Nintendo Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units which is well ahead of the original Switch (4.7 million) and the PS5 (7.8 million) cementing its place as the fastest selling console of all time. It’s selling so well in fact that Nintendo has raised its hardware forecast up to 19m units (from 15 million) for the whole financial year. As far as games go, Mario Kart World managed to sell 9.57 million units (that includes bundles sold), Donkey Kong Bananza sold 3.49 million units and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Jamboree both managed to shift another 1.37 million units. No other Nintendo Switch 2 software was listed, but we’d expect this to change next time around. It goes without saying that the Nintendo Switch 2 has been a huge success for Nintendo who finds itself in an incredible position both from a software slate line-up, hardware/software shipped as well as pure revenue.

A Crash Bandicoot TV Show Is Apparently Coming To Netflix,"Crash has been quiet in the gaming scene in the last few years, but it’s now being reported that a Crash Bandicoot series is coming to Netflix. The series is set to be created by WildBrain Studios who have worked on Sonic Prime which ran for three seasons as well as other animated shows such as Carmen Sandiego, Johnny Test and Go, Dog. Go!. As far as plot details and casting goes, those details are being kept under-wraps, but no doubt this has the potential to be a big deal. Crash Bandicoot rose to fame as a PlayStation icon in 1991, but is now owned by Activision which means its in the hands of Xbox. We’ll let you know as more information comes to light with this one, and you can read more about it on What’s On Netflix.

Games Coming Out In November 2025 That You Should Be Excited For,"There’s one date that’ll be on everybody’s lips in the month to come. November 14, and that’s not simply because it’s the birthday of a couple of kings in (actual) King Charles and myself, it’ll also be the birthday of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This one is fascinating from an industry at large perspective, with Battlefield 6 enjoying a hot launch , I can’t wait to see whether the big dog can wrestle back mind share with its mind-bending covert ops narrative experience.

Stray is an adventure where you play as a cat and we gave it a 9/10 in our review saying : “Stray is a brisk and relentlessly charming adventure that offers a very unique window into a gorgeous sci-fi world. It won’t challenge your mind or your reflexes too much but it’ll absolutely delight your senses.

Halo Campaign Evolved Is A Full Remake With New Missions And It’s Coming To PS5 Too,"Halo Campaign Evolved has been officially revealed and it’s a full remake of the original game coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026. The game has the complete campaign with enhanced level design, updated cinematics and more, three new prequel missions, 9 additional iconic weapons from across the series, the ability to play the game in 2-player split-screen co-op or 4 player online co-op and a bunch of other improvements. We got to play the game early and you can read all about it HERE. HALO CAMPAIGN EVOLVED NEW FEATURES The Complete Campaign, Rebuilt: Battle through the original missions, newly rebuilt with enhanced level design, updated cinematics, and improved wayfinding, refined to keep the pace moving without losing the wonder, tension, or heroism of the original. Cinematics and Audio Overhauled: Iconic vistas, alien architecture, and sci-fi wonders are reborn with all-new visuals, cinematics, and animations. The soundtrack has been remastered, the sound design updated for greater immersion, and new voice performances recorded with the primary cast. Combat and Weapons Expanded: Classic Halo combat feels instantly familiar yet sharper than ever. Sprint, aim, and engage with refined precision. For the first time in Halo : CE, you can wield 9 additional iconic weapons from across the series, including the Energy Sword, giving you more ways to approach every fight. Three New Prequel Missions: Join the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson in a brand-new arc set before the events of Halo : Combat Evolved, featuring new environments, gameplay, characters, and enemies. Play Solo or with Friends: Experience the full campaign in 2-player split-screen co-op (console only) or 4-player online co-op, complete with crossplay and shared progression across console and PC. Drive, Hijack, Wreak Havoc: Whether you’re racing across the map in a Warthog or flipping it over with friends, vehicles have always been at the heart of Halo ’s fun. Now they go even further: for the first time in Halo : CE, you can hijack enemy rides and pilot a fully drivable Wraith, creating unforgettable chaos. Remix Your Campaign for Endless Replayability: Use the campaign remix feature to return to any mission and remix the experience with the most gameplay-modifying “Skulls” ever in a Halo campaign. These optional modifiers add challenge and variety with randomized weapons, enemies, and environments.

The Simpsons X Fortnite’s Key Art And Map Have Leaked Ahead Of Launch,"We’ve known for some time that the final season of Fortnite Chapter 6 will feature The Simpsons, but we now have a total key art leak which reveals the characters coming to the game, as well as the map (which will apparently transform into Springfield as the month rolls on). As far as characters go, we obviously have Marge and Homer front and centre, Bart and Lisa are riding exoskeletons which should bring them up to the same height as regular characters, and I think Maggie will get that same treatment as we can see her off in the distance getting carried away by Kang and Kodos. FORTNITE SIMPSONS SEASON (HD KEY ART) pic.twitter.com/eL7l1skLRJ — Shiina (@ShiinaBR) October 23, 2025 Outside of that it’s a mix of side-characters with Krusty, Ned, Scratchy and Moe all seen around the map, and Fortnite characters such as Peely are seen in a cel-shaded art style. We also get a look at a cel-shaded storm as well, which makes sense given the rest of the game is being given that treatment. As far as the map goes, it’s rumoured that it will keep fully evolving into Springfield as the month rolls on with the first iteration having the Town Square and Nuclear Power Plant, but we can see Moe’s Tavern in addition to the Krust-E-Burger in the key art as well. Fortnite x Simpsons Map VIA @Jorge_Most_ pic.twitter.com/Cgo10krKGK — iFireMonkey (@iFireMonkey) October 23, 2025 As a massive The Simpsons fan (and just coming off Ghostface entering the game), I’m super excited to jump back into Fortnite and can’t wait to do just that next week.

The best indie games in 2025,"I've always been a fan of big-budget blockbusters, whether it be movies or video games, but when it comes to the latter, I'm beginning to see the light more and more: indie games are the lifeblood. While 2025 had its fair share of AAA successes ( Death Stranding 2, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, and Ghost of Yōtei spring to mind), it was dominated by indie games. Smaller teams, smaller budgets (mostly), but big aspirations and even bigger excitement. Here are Destructoid's picks for some of the best indie games throughout the year of 2025. Table of contents Best 2025 indie games Hades 2 Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Ball x Pit Absolum Blue Prince Hollow Knight: Silksong Dispatch Best 2025 indie games Hades 2 Image via Supergiant Games The masters of the action roguelike genre returned with the 1.0 release of Hades 2 . Supergiant Games iterated on and continues to perfect the addictive and satisfying gameplay, wrapped in a stunning art style set against Greek mythology to create one of the best overall games of 2025. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Image via Sandfall Interactive There's an argument to be made about what's indie and what isn't, but this list was never not going to include Expedition 33 . Sandfall Interactive's debut title was Destructoid's 2025 Game of the Year , and just about everyone else's, too. And it deserves it. Ball x Pit Screenshot by Destructoid Ball x Pit caught my eye immediately when it dropped as a Steam demo earlier in the year. Upon release, I had the pleasure of reviewing it for Destructoid , and it became one of my top titles of the year overall. Base-building, ball-breaking, roguelike action wrapped up in a beautiful pixel art style created something truly memorable and still (so far) the most fun I've ever had with balls. Absolum Image via Dotemu Another gorgeous roguelike. Are you noticing a trend? Many of the top indies this year took the roguelike genre and put a lovely spin on it, like Absolum , which is a fantastic co-op beat-em-up with a Saturday morning cartoon aesthetic and also one of my overall favorites of 2025. Blue Prince Screenshot by Destructoid Before Expedition 33 launched a few weeks later, Blue Prince was at the top of many gamers' shortlists for GOTY 2025. It still deserves that honor as one of the more innovative and challenging puzzle games in recent memory. Hollow Knight: Silksong Image via Team Cherry When it comes to hype and anticipation, Silksong had some insurmountable expectations after years of quiet and delays. Fortunately for everybody involved (including us gamers), it delivered and then some, offering a fantastic and challenging expansion of the Metroidvania genre. Dispatch Image via AdHoc Studio I got an early look at Dispatch at a preview event with devs the month before it came out, and knew right away it would be something special. Many who helped create it previously worked at TellTale Games, and that quality shines through in every one of its eight episodes, crafting one of the best narratives of the year. Plus, it's got this hot, towering devil lady.

All Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive event rewards and how to get them,"The Winter Offensive event in Battlefield 6 has three new challenges for you to grind, and you can unlock some unique camos in the process. Winter Offensive has added plenty of exciting stuff ever since it went live on Dec. 9. The current event objectives will allow you to increase your rewards haul if you're unsatisfied with it. This guide will provide all the essential information required to complete the tasks as quickly as possible. Table of contents How to obtain all Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive event rewards Flying High weapon charm Scatterplot SU-57 vehicle Undergrowth B36A4 weapon package How to obtain all Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive event rewards Three new objectives were added to the Winter Offensive events earlier on Dec. 24 , and here are the available rewards. Flying High weapon charm Scatterplot SU-57 vehicle skin Undergrowth B36A4 weapon package You can obtain all the rewards by completing three separate tasks over the next five days (more on that in the following parts of this guide). Let's look at how to obtain the rewards. Screenshot by Destructoid Flying High weapon charm To get this charm, you'll need to get 100 kills on freezing enemies. You'll have to take part in the Ice Lock game mode, as it fea tures the freezing zone mechanics. To complete the objective, you'll have to kill 100 enemies that are affected by the freezing status. Scatterplot SU-57 vehicle The next part also needs to be completed in the Ice Lock game modes. Wait for enemies to appear in heat zones (areas that have fire sources).

All bosses in ARK Survival Ascended Lost Colony DLC,"The Lost Colony DLC in ARK Survival Ascended has been one of the biggest content updates to date, and it has its own share of bosses to take down. The new expansion and all the related content revolve around the Arat Prime map. There are two main bosses on the new map: the Lost King and the Lost Queen. This guide will provide you with all the essential information to know if you're looking to complete the expansion as quickly as possible. Table of contents All ARK Survival Ascended bosses in Lost Colony DLC Lost King Lost Queen All ARK Survival Ascended bosses in Lost Colony DLC As mentioned earlier, there are two main bosses to take down: Lost King and Lost Queen . Lost King The Lost King is the main boss of Arat Prime. We already knew about his looks, all thanks to the trailer. You can find him at his palace, which is the hardest stage to complete. To enter, you'll need to craft a Red-Handed relic. Lost King comes in three different variants, with each having its own requirements.

For one, you get to complete the new story, which is pretty intense. This is also the only legitimate way of gaining a Gigadesmodus for yourself. Lost Queen Once you defeat the Lost King, you'll have to face the Lost Queen. You'll get to know that she was defeated by Lost King, who made her his queen. The location is the same as the fight directly transits to Lost Queen. Like Lost King, the Lost Queen battle will have mutople phases. Once you deal enough damage, she will become temporarily immune. You'll then have to break the beam to prevent her from healing and continue the fight. Once you defeat her, interact with the codex to lower the castle shields and turn the Arat Prime back to its original form. Defeating the Lost Queen officially completes the full Lost Colony DLC campaign.

"If not for Vince Zampella and his work, I would not have found my career in gaming journalism","About 15 years ago, I was a college student studying journalism and quickly losing my way. I was taking courses on how to become a beat cop writer, calling precincts about petty crimes and writing for newspapers, a dying medium. I had another course writing for broadcast journalism, which is somehow almost an entirely different language from what I had studied in the past. I hated it. I felt totally lost. Image via Activision So, I went to my student advisor and asked for help. She simply asked me what I enjoyed, and to write about what I knew. Well, at the time, all I really knew was Call of Duty because I was playing a whole hell of a lot of it. And so that's where it all started for me. I spent the next year or so working on a 10,000-word magazine piece-style senior project (think of it as a thesis) that propelled me into something way greater than me. I found my senior project on my hard drive, and it honestly holds up pretty well. The theme of the project (titled Answering the Call: Inside a Pop Culture Phenomenon ) was CoD's wide reach as a popular game that went outside of the game experience, even all the way back then in 2010. Over the course of the year, I interviewed an esports competitor who became a friend, a journalist whom I looked up to, a couple who met on CoD and ended up getting married, and numerous others. But one of the many things that drew me to the project was an ongoing lawsuit at the time between Activision and Infinity Ward co-founders Vince Zampella and Jason West. And in the process of writing about all of these things, interviewing people, and researching the franchise that I'd already sunk countless hours into, I found my passion and realized that my future was in writing about video games. And now today, many years later and after countless challenges and hardships, on my final working day of the year, I'm celebrating the most rewarding year of my games journalism career at Destructoid. I've had more fun in the past nine months of writing for this website than I thought was possible. But it also comes with great sadness as I and many others are mourning the sudden loss of the great Zampella, one of the CoD franchise's creators and a visionary in the FPS genre. Photo via Getty Zampella passed away in a car accident on Dec. 21, leaving behind a legacy of greatness. Call of Duty, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Titanfall, Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, Battlefield 6 . Legendary gaming moments like ""No Russian,"" General Shepard's betrayal, or the bond between Jack Cooper and his Titan, BT-7274. He was an architect behind it all. But in today's somber reflection, I've realized he was also the architect of my career. He was not only the architect of one of the most successful franchises in history, but of friendships and love stories that will last forever. In his iconic games, he created jobs, worlds, and universes that will survive longer than any of us. Everything I've done this year, including traveling to industry events, reviewing over a dozen games, and interviewing many passionate developers, there's a good chance none of that would have happened without Zampella's work. And that's without even really delving into how deep his impact on gaming itself has been. Call of Duty's massive success over the past 20 years helped shape the industry into what it became. Titanfall 2 is one of my favorite single-player FPS campaigns of all time. Apex Legends was an excellent extension and memorable highlight of the battle royale craze. The Star Wars Jedi games are a critically acclaimed handling of one of the most loved and respected IP ever. And his last title, Battlefield 6 , reinvigorated the franchise to become one of the top-selling games of 2025. Image via EA Zampella's impact can't truly be quantified today, just a few days after his untimely passing. For now, we can say that he helped craft modern-day FPS games as we know them. But strictly speaking for myself, although I never had the pleasure of meeting or speaking with him, I'm quickly realizing just how much he and his work have meant to me and millions of others, on so many levels. And so, I would just like to say thank you for all of this.

"Marvel Rivals’ successful and content-packed first year was just ‘a warm-up,’ executive producer teases","The first full year of Marvel Rivals was an impressive one in a number of metrics, but according to the developers working on the free-to-play hero shooter, the game is only beginning. Looking back on its first year, Marvel Rivals delivered a lot of content. Whether it's MCU-based skins in partnership with Fantastic Four: First Steps , limited-time events with free rewards, or a shocking amount of new heroes, a tough precedent has been set. But Marvel and NetEase Games are not resting anytime soon. Screenshot by Destructoid ""2025 was more of a warm-up period for us,"" Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo said in an interview with Den of Geek . ""Next year, we’re going to have bigger plans. We’re not going to slow down. We’ve already planned more than a year ahead and I can’t wait for our players to see it."" In just one year, Marvel Rivals already has the same number of playable characters as another hero shooter, Overwatch 2 , after adding 12 to the game in 2025. That number will be surpassed quickly as Deadpool joins the roster in January, followed by Elsa Bloodstone in February, and another new hero every single month for the foreseeable future. This is going to be tough to balance, but I can't deny that this cadence keeps me coming back consistently. And according to publisher NetEase Games' publishing and marketing lead, Yachen Bian, 2026 will include more playable experiences to supplement the characters on offer. ""In the next year, we want to provide more game modes,"" Bian said. ""It’s why we have prototypes in the game, like PvE and 18v18. We want to give the players more choices of different game modes beyond the basic gameplay because your fundamental experience might be very different. When you’re fighting against zombies, it’s quite different from fighting against other people."" The first year of Rivals already included several new modes like Marvel Zombies PvE mode, a Times Square social space, and even a PvP auto-battler mode, so if there's more in the works, I and many others will likely be continuing to log in and play some games occasionally for a long time to come. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj53c2Uxrtc With 2026 boasting the potential for more PvE experiences, popular and iconic heroes like Deadpool joining the roster, the launch of a new esports model , and further MCU partnerships likely in the pipeline ( Spider-Man: Brand New Day launches in August, followed by Avengers: Doomsday in December), maybe they really are just getting started.

This obscure little game might just save us from winter depression,"Ever heard of My Summer Car ? This aging gem of a game was made by a solo dev with the help of his wife and some friends, and was inspired by his childhood. The game now holds nostalgic meaning to thousands of gamers who enjoyed the punishing experience. If you were around for that, you might not know that a sequel is well on its way. My Winter Car Image via Amistech Games The follow-up to the charming (and supremely infuriating) My Summer Car is called My Winter Car , and we can be sure we'll have more beer-drinking, sausage-eating shenanigans to look forward to. As well as another immensely complicated car to build from scratch. The game is slated for release in December 2025, but at this point, we might well be facing a delay, as the year is almost over. Still, that doesn't mean we might still get it sometime this winter, and to me, it would be the perfect game to fight the winter blues and have another grand time in the beautiful Finnish landscapes. But why am I so eager for this game – Myself and 18,000 other followers? I'll explain. My Summer Car Explained Image via Amistech Games I first came across this game via YouTuber GrayStillPlays , and it looked genuinely hilarious. I picked it up and thought that I'd watched enough videos to know what to do. Boy, was I wrong. You see, this game has a form of permadeath that was really brutal. No matter how far you are, no matter how much work you've done on your car, crash, and it's all over. Yeah, you literally need to start from scratch. And by crash, I don't mean taking a turn at 90 miles per hour and hitting a tree dead on, no. Gently tap a fence at two miles per hour, and it's tickets. The vehicles in this game must have a safety rating of negative 9,000 or something. There are also a couple of ""rivals"" who speed around the map, largely ignoring road rules. So even if you're being super careful, one of these morons could come speeding around a corner at any time and end your run for you. Don't worry, though; there are many ways to save your progress now. Gone are the days of ultimate brutality, though that option is still there if you prefer. Then there's the insane complexity of actually building up your car. You find it in the garage in pieces, and you have to put it all together again without a manual or help of any kind, really. Make the simple mistake of connecting the battery incorrectly, and that's it, back to the start with your now crispy fried ass. Yeah, this is one game in which looking up a guide really is not a gaming sin. I know I did. The map itself also has so much to discover, and you'll even end up driving a sewage truck and pumping septic tanks for an income at some point, all on a diet of beer and sausages. It's funny, it's challenging, and, most importantly, it's incredibly fun. If you haven't yet, I highly recommend you check out My Summer Car , so you can get as excited as I am about My Winter Car. With the release schedule as slow as it is over the holidays, this would be an absolute Godsend. Ever played My Summer Car , Destructoid? If so, what was your fondest experience? I'd love to hear from you in the comments.

The Division 2 Y7S3 Mutiny Week 4 Manhunt HVT: Scout 4 solutions,"The Division 2 Y7S3 Mutiny Week 4 Manhunt has finally had its first HVT of the season to hunt, and doing so is necessary if you're looking to complete Scout 4 objectives. Taking down the HVT is pretty much necessary if you're planning to take down the Manhunt target that will appear in the Mutiny finale. This guide will help you clear all the steps in the Scout 4 operations. Table of contents The Division 2 Y7S3 Mutiny Week 4 Manhunt HVT guide Complete a hostage rescue Complete Jefferson Plaza Complete the Major Bungler The Division 2 Y7S3 Mutiny Week 4 Manhunt HVT guide Scout 4 operations begin with a specific set of clues that will be visible after you activate it. Here's what the set of hints suggests. ""A group of former JTF personnel have been captured. Intel suggests Major Bungler might be involved."" ""Major Bungler has ordered extra troops to Jefferson Plaza to crack down on defections."" ""Reports indicate that Major Bungler is in Southwest."" While your task is to decode these hints, the following steps will make things easier for you. Image via Ubisoft Complete a hostage rescue The first task of Mutiny Week 4 Manhunt requires you to find an activity marked with a green handcuff symbol. You'll only find this symbol once you take control of every Control Point in a district. Go to the location and clear all hostiles. You'll get a random key drop from an enemy, which will open a door (highlighted once you clear all enemies). Use the key to spare the hostages, and this completes the first objective. Complete Jefferson Plaza Image via Ubisoft The next task is to clear the Jefferson Plaza on any difficulty. Located in the Southwest part of the DC map, you'll find stairs leading down to an underground metro station. Start the main mission available at this location at any difficulty to get more information about the HVT to take down. If you want to get this done quickly, your best bet is to lower the difficulty. Complete the Major Bungler The last challenge will pit you against Major Bungler. He is the first HVT of the Y7S3 Manhunt campaign, and you can find him in the southwest district. You'll first have to begin the Bounty and withstand three waves of enemies. Major Bungler will then appear, carrying a lot of arsenal. You should target the weapons first, since they can break. This will make the fight easier. You can also use your companions to help you clear the reinforcements without having to do it by yourself. Once done, you will receive an audio transmission. This transmission will reveal an interesting story plot that I will not spoil. Completing it will bring you one step closer to completing the seasonal finale.

How to grow Shrooms in Schedule 1 (Mushrooms guide),"Mushrooms are coming soon to Schedule 1 , and they're already available in the beta branch of the game. Mushrooms were voted earlier by the community to be part of the next major update. Expectations were for it to arrive in November, but it has taken Tyler a little longer. This guide will update you on all the steps required to grow your own batch. How to get Mushrooms in Schedule 1 Obtaining your first batch of Mushrooms will take some time if you're just a beginner. It's tied with a quest called 'Vibin' on the 'Cybin'. While this isn't a full-fledged mission guide, I will briefly explain what needs to be done. Screenshot by Destructoid Open your mobile, and you'll get a text from Fungal Phil. Next, purchase Spores, grain bags, and substrate. You can order these items as a dead drop. Go to the Hardware Store and get a spray bottle and an AC unit. Get the items you ordered as a dead drop, and then go to Oscar after sunset. You'll need a Mushroom Spawner and a Mushroom Bed. Go to a property of your choice and place the Mushroom Spawner. The Spawner has two slots where you put the Grain Bag and the Syringe. Remove the Syringe's cap and push it into the bag. Lay down the Mushroom Bed, and take the output out of the Spawner. Take the substrate and dump it on the Mushroom Bed. Put down the Mushroom Spawn (or Shroom spawn) on the substrate and put the soil over them for the growth phase. Place the AC, and lower the room temperature. Screenshot by Destructoid Next, take the Water Sprayer and spray in five different spots. You're now all done, so just wait. Once the Mushrooms have grown, you have to pick them up and package them before selling. If you want better quality Shrooms, you can add Fertilizers to the growth process. You can also use a Drying Rack to get customized quality products. That's how easy it is to unlock the Shrooms and grow them. Do note that this is only available in the beta track as of writing.

How to find Frozen Raider Containers in ARC Raiders,"Season 2's first set of Trials is now live in ARC Raiders , and getting three stars requires you to find Frozen Raider Containers. This item is exclusive to the Cold Snap update. You'll have to find a fair few to take your Trials rank to three stars (to get the best rewards). While their locations are completely random, this guide will help you out as much as possible. How to get Frozen Raider Containers in ARC Raiders Frozen Raider Containers are simply Raider Caches (part of the game since launch) covered in snow. All caches that you can find from frozen areas will count for the Trials in Season Two, Week One. Naturally, you'll need to have the Cold Snap condition active. Without this map condition, you won't find frozen areas, and hence no containers. The screenshot below is based on the Spaceport map, but you can find caches on all the maps, as long as Cold Snap is active. Screenshot and remix by Destructoid On Spaceport, most of the Frozen Raider Containers appear to be on the outer edge of the map. I have marked a few of the spots where I have found them. Ideally, you'll be able to find many of these containers in a single raid. For better results, play with friends so that you can find more containers simultaneously. Since the containers are embedded deep in the ground, you'll have to look carefully. They do stick out amidst the white snow, but the environmental hazards won't make things easier. You'll also be taking damage from Frostbite, so carry plenty of healing items. You can also create a route based on the locations marked on the screenshot above to make things more efficient. If you have started the Season 2 grind, make sure to check out all the tasks and how you can complete them to earn three stars in the process.

"Vince Zampella, head of Respawn and Call of Duty co-creator, dies in car crash","Co-founder of Infinity Ward, co-creator of Call of Duty , and co-founder of Respawn Entertainment Vince Zampella has died in a car crash, according to a new report from NBC4 in Los Angeles. Zampella was involved in a single-car crash on Angeles Crest Highway north of LA, according to the report, at about 12:55pm local time on Dec. 21. The vehicle veered off the road before hitting a concrete barrier and a passenger was ejected from the car. Both Zampella and the passenger did not survive. Image via Activision One of the architects of modern FPS games as we know it, Zampella's work history includes Medal of Honor and the co-creation of the original Call of Duty titles. Under his leadership, Infinity Ward released Call of Duty, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 , after which he moved on to co-found Respawn Entertainment and oversee such games as Titanfall , Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi series . ""Vince was an extraordinary person — a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognize talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,"" said The Game Awards founder and friend of Zampella, Geoff Keighley. ""He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work. I’ll miss our dinners and long conversations. And while he created some of the most influential games of our time, I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it."" Zampella also was the leader of the Los Angeles branch of DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, one of the makers of Battlefield 6 , a franchise that he recently took over as its lead. His impact on the modern day gaming industry cannot be overstated. He was 55 years old. Image via Respawn Entertainment Destructoid staff would like to send our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and co-workers in this unimaginably difficult time. Update on Dec. 22 at 3:33pm CT: Electronic Arts, owner of Respawn Entertainment, released this statement this afternoon to confirm the news: ""This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come."" California Highway Patrol also put out a statement: ""For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed. The passenger was ejected from the vehicle and the driver remained trapped. Both parties succumbed to their injuries. It is currently unknown whether alcohol and/or drugs were a factor in this crash."" Update on Dec. 22 at 4:05pm CT: Zampella's former studio Infinity Ward posted this statement on X/Twitter : ""Rest in peace Vince. As one of the founders of Infinity Ward and Call of Duty , you will always have a special place in our history. Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable. Our deepest condolences to Vince’s family and loved ones upon this terrible tragedy."" Update on Dec. 22 at 5:30pm CT: Respawn Entertainment has released its statement on Zampella's passing. ""We're heartbroken by the passing of our founder and dear friend Vince Zampella. Vince was a titan and legend of this industry, a visionary leader and a force who shaped teams and games like Call of Duty , Titanfall, Apex Legends, the Star Wars Jedi series and Battlefield for our community in ways that will be felt for generations. His impact reached far beyond any one game or studio. We will remember Vince for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas, and believing in Respawn & Battlefield. Most importantly, he championed what he believed was right for the people behind those studios and our players because it mattered. We will miss him greatly. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and all who love him.""

How to complete The Fury (Part 1) in Avatar Frontiers of Pandora From the Ashes DLC,"The Fury (Part 1) is the first of a new questline that's been added to Avatar Frontiers of Pandora as part of From the Ashes DLC . Divided into three parts, the quest takes you all across the new region in search of enemies and items. Part 1 begins with Yeylan informing So'lek that RDA is capturing animals from all over the map. Your first task is to perform a thorough investigation into the situation. Table of contents Avatar Frontiers of Pandora The Fury (Part 1) quest walkthrough Locate and Investigate the distress signal site Return the Stormglider egg Gp to the Resource Containment Outpost Access the control center at Resource Containment Outpost Avatar Frontiers of Pandora The Fury (Part 1) quest walkthrough The Fury (Part 1) quest can be broken down into four subparts. Locate and Investigate the distress signal site Return the Stormglider egg Go to the Resource Containment Outpost Access the control center at Resource Containment Outpost Image via Ubisoft Locate and Investigate the distress signal site Image via Ubisoft Your first task is to go to the crash site that the RDA distress signal was sent from. The quest marker will lead you to the location in Silk Woods. You'll find a few RDA soldiers to defeat at this location. Investigate the surroundings to find more clues about what to do next. Return the Stormglider egg You'll receive a Stormglider egg upon completing the previous part of the quest. You'll have to return it to its nest. The quest marker will lead you to the location. You'll encounter two adult Stormgliders at the location. They're the parents, and you'll have to avoid being seen as you place the egg. Use stealth to go past the Stormgliders and put the egg back. You'll then get a message that the RDA is en route to this location. Defeat all the arriving forces to proceed. Gp to the Resource Containment Outpost Image via Ubisoft The next quest marker will take you to the Resource Containment Outpost. Go close and look for a vantage point to examine the facility. To infiltrate, you'll need to climb a wall and go inside. Defeat all the forces you find at the outpost and then free the trapped Soundblast Colossus. Then you'll have to defeat all incoming soldiers to prevent the animal from being killed. Once done, Teyland will open the gate to the outpost, and the beast will escape. Access the control center at Resource Containment Outpost Your last task is to access the control center of the Resource Containment Outpost. This will allow you to open Gate B and then head inside. You'll find multiple cages, and you have to use your knife to destroy the locks. This will free the captives, and you'll discover an NPC named Itu.

ARC Raiders Week 9 Trials (Dec. 22) – How to get three stars,"Dec. 22 marks the start of a new season in ARC Raiders , and with it arrives fresh Trials. The new set, available until Dec. 29, has five tasks to complete. As always, some of the tasks are harder to complete than the rest. This guide has all the information you need to complete the tasks and obtain three stars. Table of contents ARC Raiders Week 9 Trials guide Search First Wave Husks Damage Leapers Harvest Plants Search Frozen Raider Containers Destroy Ticks ARC Raiders Week 9 Trials guide The Week 9 Trials can be broken down into five tasks. Search First Wave husks Damage Leapers Harvest plants Search Frozen Raider Containers Destroy Ticks Search First Wave Husks The First Wave Husks are remains of gigantic metallic robots that were destroyed in the war against humanity. Their remains can be found all over, but the best spots have always been on Blue Gate. To increase your odds, you should wait for the Husk Graveyard condition, since that will increase the number of interactive metal shells. You'll also gain double contribution points when the map condition is active. Damage Leapers Screenshot and remix by Destructoid While this task is relatively simple, you'll have to be careful. Getting caught in the open by Leapers means almost certain death. One of my favorite spots is the elevator near the Water Control building on Dam Battlegrounds. A Leaper almost always roams the land near the elevator, and there's also a bunker. Being in the bunker will stop the Leaper's attacks from doing damage, and you can keep shooting at it. To get three stars, you'll want to use a weapon that has decent DPS, and you should always hit its joints and eyes. Those are the softer areas, which will get you loads of damage fast. Harvest Plants Screenshot and Remix by Destructoid Various plants can spawn on every map, excluding Stella Montis. For example, the South Swamp area in Dam Battlegrounds has loads of foliage to go through. If you're on Blue Gate, the Olive Garden in the southern part of the map is a great spot to hit as well. Ultimately, you can also opt for efficient farming routes on YouTube. However, you can take your sweet time completing this task and getting the rank to three stars. Your progress will be counted across multiple raids, so there's no need for optimal routes (I prefer completing this task by mixing with other quests). Search Frozen Raider Containers Screenshot and remix by Destructoid To find Frozen Raider Containers, you'll want to head to a map with the active Cold Snap condition. These are just ordinary Raider caches, but covered in snow. The frozen variants offer better rewards. My favorite map for this is Dam Battlegrounds, and you'll want to look around the spot marked in the screenshot above. However, you can also find Raider Containers on other maps, as long as the Cold Snap condition is active. Destroy Ticks The best map for this task is Stella Montis. The Stella Montis has multiple rooms that you can access via the doors. To be more specific, you'll want to target the rooms on the base floor. Many of these rooms can have Ticks hiding behind the doors. Ticks are easy to kill as they don't have much health or armor. However, they can swarm you quite quickly if you're not paying attention. Shotguns are great for dealing with ticks.

FC 26 set to begin the new year on positive note with drastic changes to AI defending,"Year 2026 might finally have good news for FC 26 players as EA Sports is all set to make some much-needed changes to AI defending. AI defending has been a massive frustration for the community. It's been so overpowered that many players simply don't control their defenders or attempt to make manual tackles at all. Thankfully, the upcoming changes promise improvement, and EA Sports spoke about what they plan to do. FC 26's AI defending changes could finally sort out an old issue On Dec. 22, EA Sports briefly explained changes it plans to make in Ultimate Team. The AI defending will be nerfed to a great extent from what we have now. In the current meta, the AI-controlled defenders move too quickly, especially when moving sideways. https://twitter.com/EASFCDirect/status/2003133695268450423 This allows the defenders to effortlessly close down opposition attackers without much influence from players. In some ways, this completely reduces the need for you to defend manually. In many cases, it's better to let the AI-controlled defenders make the tackle to win the ball. However, the upcoming changes will greatly reduce the movement speed of AI-controlled defenders. This includes the speed at which they move sideways, and also the rate at which they can close down attackers on their own. Once the patch goes live, the meta should shift significantly as the slower movement will definitely affect AI-defending as we know it. In other words, manual defending should be making a comeback soon. However, plenty of promises have been made in the past, and it remains to be seen whether these changes will have the effect that EA hopes for.

Cüce Demirci Olduğumuz Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith Türkiye’ye Özel Fiyatla Çıktı,"Compact Core imzalı Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith, Türkiye’ye özel fiyat etiketiyle Steam Erken Erişim’de yerini aldı. Daha önce Barista Simulator ve BBQ Simulator oyunlarını geliştiren Compact Core Games, yayıncılığını GameDev.ist’in üstlendiği M edieval Crafter: Blacksmith ile oyuncuları bir cüce demirci olmaya davet ediyor. 22 Eylül’de Steam’de yerini alacak olan oyunda hem günlük araç gereçler dövüyor hem de kudretli silahları can veriyoruz. Silah atölyemizde dövdüğümüz silah ve zırhları görev temelli bir oynanış döngüsüyle satmak da mümkün. Oyunun en ilginç yanlarından biri ise üretim simülasyonunu, bağımlılık yapıcı bir yönetim döngüsüyle birleştirmesinde yatıyor. Oyunda dövdüğümüz güçlü silahları doğrudan satmak yerine kahramanlarla anlaşıp, onları giydirebiliyoruz. Ekipmanlarımızla bizzat kuşattığımız kahramanları daha sonra görevlere gönderiyor ve bu görevlerden ganimet, yeni silah şemaları ve kıymetli malzemeler elde ediyoruz. Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith bu yönüyle hem zanaat simülasyonu hem de yönetim elementlerini sevenler için ideal. Çıkışına saatler kala 32.000 istek listesine ulaşan yapım, Türkiye’ye özel fiyat etiketiyle çıkış yapacak. Üstelik %20’lik çıkış indirimiyle çok daha cazip bir fiyat etiketine dönüşüyor. Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith 30.000 İstek Listesinde! Erken Erişim etiketiyle çıkan yapım ilerleyen süreçte atölyeyi düzenleme ve genişletme gibi yeni güncellemelerle buluşacak. Otomasyon elementini de oyuna kazandırmak isteyen geliştirici ekip, ham maddeleri toplamak için atölyemizde işçi çalıştırmamızı sağlayarak, farklı formüller ile oynanışı derinleştirmeyi hedefliyor. Birçok Erken Erişim oyununda olduğu gibi Compact Core Games de bu süreçte oyuncuların geri bildirimlerine de ihtiyaç duyacak. Eğer Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith’i geliştiricilerle birlikte tam sürüme taşımak isterseniz, oyunun Discord sunucusuna katılabilirsiniz.

Yetimhane Öyküleri: Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles Steam’de Çıktı,"Pugsy Studios imzalı 4-kişilik co-op korku oyunu Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles, Steam Erken Erişim’de çıktı. Gerçek hikâyelerden esinlenen oyunda yanmış bir yetimhanede ruhların kim olduğunu tespit ediyoruz. İsterseniz tek başınıza, isterseniz de arkadaşlarınızla oynayabileceğiniz Lost Lullabies’da temel döngüyü zenginleştiren birçok teçhizat ve atlatması güç korku dolu anlar var. Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles nasıl bir oyun? Lost Lullabies, bizleri Lowell kasabasına götürüyor. Kasaba ile aynı isimdeki yetimhane ise ürkütücü hikâyeler ve olaylar ile çevrili. Bu yetimhane, çocukların işkence gördüğü ve acımasız deneylere tabi tutulduğu kötü bir şöhrete sahip. Lost Lullabies da öyküsünü bu konsept üzerine kuruyor. 1960 yılında gizemli bir şekilde yanarak kül olan yetimhane 1980 yılında dört arkadaşın burayı keşfetmek istemesi ile yeniden ziyaret edilir. Bu ziyaret ile birlikte Lowell Yetimhanesi’nin sırları bir bir açığa çıkar. Ruhların peşinde! Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles’ın temel oynanış döngüsü yetimhanede kol gezen hayaletleri bulmak üzerine kurulu. Oyuncular çeşitli ekipmanlardan yardım alarak, Lowell Yetimhanesi’ni mesken tutan ruhları durdurmak için öncelikle ruhların geçmişlerini öğrenmesi gerekiyor. Hayaletlerin geçmişine dair detayları bulmak için de bulmacalar çözmeli ve parçaları birleştirmek gerek. Ancak her yanan ve terk edilen binada olduğu gibi Lowell Yetimhanesi’nde de kötücül ruhlar var. Dolayısıyla Lost Lullabies’da iyi hayaletleri kurtarırken kötücül ruhlarla da mücadele etmek lazım. Hayaletlerin türünü belirlemek için çeşitli bir ekipman havuzu da mevcut. Toplamda 24 adet farklı ekipman bulunuyor ve bunlar sayesinde doğru hayaleti bulmaya çalışıyoruz. Ayrıca bu oyunda bir ses etkileşimi de bulunuyor. Hayaletler mikrofonunuzdan aldığı sese göre tepki veriyor ki bu da son dönem korku oyunlarındaki atmosferi daha üst seviyeye taşıyan bir mekanik. Çıkardığınız her ses, sizi ruhlar için bir hedef haline getirebilir. Korku bu kadar güzel görünmemişti Pugsy Studios imzalı Lost Lullabies grafik açısından da odlukça güçlü. Özellikle yetimhane içindeki bazı anlar gerçekten görsel şölen diyebiliriz. Ekipmanlardan çıkan ışıkların duvarlara yansıması ve ay ışığını kırık tahtalar arasından süzmesi oyunun atmosferine harika bir katkı sunmuş. Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles ‘ı satın alın ve istek listenize ekleyin. Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles, erken erişim sürümü ile oyuncularla buluştu.

Can PS1 Controllers Work On PS2?,"With PlayStation, Sony introduced a revolutionary way to enjoy games that were now in full 3D and featured huge FMV cutscenes for a more cinematic experience. To navigate through this exciting new world gamers used the brand-new controller that had a D-pad with 4 face buttons (X, square, triangle, circle). It even had triggers for your middle fingers, something that every prior controller had lacked. But can PS1 controllers work on PS2? Yes, they will work on PS2 because both PS1 and PS2 controllers share the same port and basic control layout. Because PS2 uses a PS1 CPU as its I/O chip, it can perfectly read inputs from a PS1 controller and can even read PS1 memory cards . If you connect your PS1 controller to a PS2, make sure you’re not using it for a game that requires the DualShock. If the game doesn’t need analog sticks, you can play it just fine with a PS1 controller. Another thing to remember is that the PS1 controller doesn’t have pressure-sensitive buttons, while the DualShock does. PS1 Controller vs PS2 Controller If you open up both controllers you’ll see that they share much of the same basic circuitry with two exceptions. Firstly, the DualShock has two analog sticks and rumble motors. Secondly, it has pressure-sensitive buttons that are used by a small group of games such as Gran Turismo. What this means is that you can control the throttle and brake in Gran Turismo using just the X and square button rather than the right analog stick. This feature didn’t stick around for too long because it had more downsides than upsides. For example, people often found themselves slowing down in racing games just because they slightly lifted off on the X button. These days, the only pressure-sensitive parts of a controller are the triggers (L2 and R2). PlayStation 1’s controller had none of these fancy features, it didn’t have a rumble motor or analog sticks. Yet, games were designed around these limitations until the upgrade controller with analog sticks arrived in 1997. You don’t have to do anything special to make a PS1 controller work on PS2. Just plug it in like a DualShock and insert your PS1 disc into the tray. PS2 can also read PS1 memory cards (these will only work with PS1 games, not with PS2 games). Is A PS2 Controller Compatible With A PS1? Here’s the fun part- not only does a PS1 controller work flawlessly on PS2, but a PS2 controller will also work flawlessly on PS1. Because the controllers are so similar in how they process and send inputs, you can use them on either console. Just keep in mind the fact that many PS2 games require analog sticks so you can’t play them with a PS1 controller. What Controllers Work On A PS2? In addition to PS1 and DualShock controllers, PS2 can also support a small group of third-party controllers. The Logitech Wireless Action Controller is officially licensed and built quite well. You can also purchase modern 3 rd party controllers for your PS2, such as this one from Blue Lake Performance. Do PS1 Controllers Work On PS3? The DualShock 3 works perfectly for playing PS1 games on PS3, but you can’t use the original PS1 controllers. PS3 has USB ports rather than the old controller ports, which are used primarily for charging the wireless DualShock 3. If you want, you can purchase an adapter that makes PS1/ PS2 controllers work on PS3. Which PS2 Model Plays PS1 Games? All of them, because PS2’s I/O chip is just a PS1 CPU. Normally this works as a controller for the front ports, DVD drive, rear expansion slot, etc. But if a PS1 disc is detected, this I/O chip switches into backward compatibility mode. Did PS1 Have Joysticks? Not originally, but it got upgraded controllers in 1997 called Dual Analog. Eventually, this developed into the DualShock which would be used on PlayStation 2. Because Sony hadn’t quite figured out a durable enough rumble system, they removed rumble from the European and American releases of the Dual Analog controller. Thankfully, this feature was put back into DualShock for PS2. Conclusion I hope this article helped you understand more about the backward compatibility of PS2 with PS1 controllers. You can connect a PS1 controller to a PS2 as long as the game doesn’t require a DualShock. Some games even use the pressure-sensitive buttons of DualShock 2 and won’t work with a regular DualShock. For those who aren’t aware, the DualShock is an improved version of the Dual Analog controller that was originally released in 1997 for PS1. It added rumble, and the DualShock 2 is a DualShock with pressure-sensitive face buttons. Because it uses the same protocol as a PS1 controller, a PS2 controller can be connected to the PS1.

Bungie Veteran Joseph Cross Appears to No Longer Be Marathon’s Franchise Art Director [UPDATE],"Bungie veteran Joseph Cross appears to have stepped away as Marathon’s Franchise Art Director, based on recent LinkedIn and social media changes. Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has slowly been finding its footing again after a rocky year . The studio released a new 22-minute ViDoc giving us a much cleaner, more polished look at the game, along with new dev updates on what’s changed since the early Closed Alpha test. Bungie is now targeting a March 2026 release window for the game. Following its gameplay reveal earlier this year, the game faced heavy criticism from parts of the community, with fans asking for features like proximity chat, solo play, and improved visuals . Bungie has confirmed that proximity chat and solo play option are coming to Marathon, and we already saw a much better look at the exterior environments in the new ViDoc. Image: Bungie Related: Court Dismisses Ex-Marathon Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit Against Bungie and Sony But Marathon hasn’t had an easy road since its gameplay reveal earlier this year. The biggest controversy came from the art theft situation , where 1:1 design assets were found in the alpha build of the game that had been used without permission from independent artist Antireal (4nt1r34l). Bungie publicly acknowledged and apologized for the issue at the time, and Antireal later said the dispute has been resolved to her satisfaction . Now, there is a new development that has caught the attention of fans. Joseph Cross Appears to No Longer Be Marathon’s Franchise Art Director It appears that longtime Bungie veteran Joseph Cross may no longer be serving as Marathon’s Franchise Art Director, or may have left Bungie entirely. This information comes from changes spotted on Cross’ LinkedIn profile, where his role as Senior Art Director at Bungie is listed as ending (or ended) sometime in 2025. Cross had held that position since 2018, which is around when Marathon entered development. His long tenure made him one of the key creative figures tied to the project. In addition to LinkedIn, Cross’ public social media presence has also changed. Earlier this year, his X profile bio listed him as “Franchise Art Director, Marathon @ Bungie .” That wording has since been updated to a broader description that reads “Art Director & Artist – Marathon. Dune. Destiny…” with no direct mention of Bungie or a specific leadership role. Update, December 18, 2:03 PM PT: After our report, Kotaku’s Ethan Gach reached out to Joseph Cross. Cross confirmed he left Bungie by choice. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” Cross said. Image: X | LinkedIn via The Game Post Related: Destiny 2 Leak Reveals Marathon Crossover Armor Sets and Cosmetics This does not fully confirm that Joseph Cross has left Bungie. It is also possible that he has simply moved into a different position within the studio or stepped away from the Marathon project while remaining at Bungie in another role. The Game Post has reached out to both Joseph Cross and Bungie for comment. We will update this story if we receive a response. As for Marathon itself, Bungie recently announced several changes aimed at addressing player feedback, including improvements to visual clarity, emphasis on “dark sci-fi world” building, and new social features like proximity chat. Image: Bungie Related: Alberto Mielgo defends the Marathon cinematic as “not AI,” denies his team touched Bungie’s plagiarized material and calls the art theft incident a genuine mistake that was “blown out of proportion” What do you think about this potential leadership change and Marathon’s road to release?

"Sony vs Tencent ‘Horizon Clone’ Lawsuit Over Light of Motiram Ends in Settlement, Game Delisted From Storefronts","Sony and Tencent have reached a confidential settlement to end the Light of Motiram “Horizon clone” lawsuit, and it looks like the game has now been delisted from major PC storefronts. Sony and Tencent’s legal battle over Light of Motiram , a game Sony previously described as a Horizon lookalike, appears to have reached its end. The lawsuit, filed by Sony Interactive Entertainment in late July 2025 in a California federal court, accused Tencent and its subsidiaries of copying major elements from the Horizon series, including its world, characters, and overall presentation. Over the last few months, the case turned into a back-and-forth about what counts as inspiration versus copying. Sony pushed hard for an order to stop the game from moving forward, while Tencent ’s side argued Sony was trying to lock up common ideas and style choices in the genre. Image: Tencent | Polaris Quest Related: Tencent pushes to throw out Sony’s Light of Motiram lawsuit, saying it’s “based on future conduct that has not, and may never occur,” and arguing that “fame does not create a trademark” as Sony “fails to identify Aloy’s appearance as a trademark outside the game” Just two weeks ago , things still looked like they were headed toward a bigger showdown in early 2026. The two sides even agreed, on paper, that Tencent would pause promotion and public tests while the legal schedule played out, with the idea that major issues could be heard together in January. Then came a surprising new development. In a new court filing submitted earlier today and obtained by The Game Post , it appears the lawsuit is over. Sony and Tencent End the Light of Motiram Lawsuit According to the filing, Sony and Tencent jointly asked the court to dismiss the case under a rule that allows both sides to end a lawsuit by agreement . The document makes it clear that this decision follows a confidential settlement between all parties involved. The lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice. That means the case is closed for good , and the same claims cannot be brought back to court later. The filing also confirms that all pending motions have been withdrawn and that each side will cover its own legal costs. Here is the full statement from the court document: “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and the confidential settlement of all parties, Plaintiff Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC and Defendants Tencent America LLC, Proxima Beta U.S. LLC, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Proxima Beta PTE Ltd., and Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Company Ltd., by and through their undersigned counsel of record, hereby stipulate as follows: “All pending motions are withdrawn and this action is hereby dismissed with prejudice. All parties shall bear their own fees and costs.” Image: Tencent Related: After Sony’s ‘Horizon’ Knock-Off Lawsuit Against Tencent, Light of Motiram Dev Scrubs Store Page, Changing Game Description, Images, and Key Art There is no mention of how much money, if any, changed hands as part of the settlement. The terms are fully confidential, and this was the only court filing submitted today. For now, there is no public record that reveals the actual value of the deal or any specific conditions tied to it. Light of Motiram Gets Delisted from Storefronts Adding another layer to the story, Light of Motiram was also delisted from major storefronts earlier today , just before the court filing appeared. The game’s product pages on both Steam and the Epic Games Store were removed, making it unavailable to view or wishlist on either platform. At the time of writing, the Epic Games Store link leads to a 404 Page Not Found screen. And on Steam , the game’s product page no longer loads a normal product page and instead drops you back onto Steam’s main storefront. As things stand, the lawsuit is finished, the game is no longer listed on major stores, and many questions remain unanswered.

PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR 2 Reportedly Doesn’t Have Frame Generation in the Plans,"A new rumor about PS5 Pro’s PSSR 2 says Sony isn’t planning frame generation. If you’ve been keeping an eye on PS5 Pro news, PSSR 2 has quickly become the big “next year” rumor . The recent leaks claim Sony is working on a major upgrade to its PSSR upscaling for 2026 , with a new approach that’s supposed to look cleaner while using less memory and less GPU time. The chatter also says it would need game updates, since it may rely on a new API instead of being a simple switch. Now, a new round of details has surfaced, and it focuses on one feature some people assumed was coming along for the ride: frame generation. Image: Sony Related: “It’s not some 0.5 upgrade, it’s huge”: New leak claims PS5 Pro will get “PSSR 2” in 2026 using “Multi-Frame Super Resolution 2” to cut memory use and GPU time PS5 Pro PSSR 2 rumor says no frame gen The new comments come from hardware leaker and insider, Moore’s Law Is Dead in a new Broken Silicon episode , where he says he’s relaying what he’s hearing from developer sources and backend documentation. When the discussion turned to frame generation for the next version of PSSR, he shared a message he says came from a source familiar with Sony’s tooling. Here’s what he said: “A source I was talking about this [PSSR 2], then I just asked, ‘is there any reference to frame gen?'” Apparently, the source replied, “not a single one in the next PSSR. I haven’t heard a single developer ask Sony to add Frame Gen to PSSR.” He then follows with:”“not only is Sony not working on it, but they know that developers hate it, hate it, hate it.” The claim is not that frame generation is impossible on PlayStation, but that Sony’s next PSSR 2 upgrade is being treated as an upscaling and image-quality project, not a frame-gen initiative. One possible reason is that frame generation can come with tradeoffs like artifacts and inconsistent motion. Image: Sony Related: New PlayStation 6 handheld leak claims Sony “needs” devs to support PS5 Low Power mode and “maintain 60 FPS by lowering resolutions” to get games ready for launch As for the bigger PSSR 2 package, the earlier rumor set is still the same. The leaks have described PSSR 2 as “MFSR2” internally, with goals like needing fewer inputs, reducing memory use, cutting GPU processing time, and improving image quality versus current PSSR. There’s also talk of Sony shipping better debugging tools for teams, including a replay tool to help track down PSSR artifacting issues. As always, take all of this with a grain of salt. None of it is confirmed by Sony, and “developer sources” can mean anything from early notes to outdated plans. On the PS6 handheld side, the latest rumor says Sony’s new PS5 Power Saver push could be more than just saving electricity . In this same episode, Moore’s Law Is Dead claims a source told him Sony has patched every PS5 dev SDK back to version 1.0 so studios can add Power Saver support even on older builds, and that Sony is treating this as a bigger internal priority than PS5 Pro-specific work. He also points to a CPU optimization doc that allegedly hints at more Low Power modes coming, and says games should be able to run on only 8 CPU threads. The idea is that if PS5 games can reliably run in a lower-power profile, it becomes much easier to carry them over to the rumored PS6 handheld without every game needing a painful custom rewrite. Image: Sony | TCMFGames Related: PlayStation Leak Hints at “Cross-Buy” Feature, Possibly Between PS5, PC, and Rumored PS6 Handheld What do you think? Would you rather Sony focus on making PSSR 2 cleaner and cheaper to run, or do you want frame generation in the mix too?",2025-12-16T19:16:25+00:00,Abdullah Jawad,The Game Post,https://thegamepost.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-frame-generation-isnt-plan/
Destiny 2 Loot Tables: All Raids And Dungeons Gear,"Discover comprehensive loot tables for all Destiny 2 raids and dungeons, detailing the exotic and legendary rewards players can earn from these challenging endgame activities. Destiny 2 offers an expansive universe filled with numerous activities for players to explore, but none are as challenging or rewarding as raids and dungeons. Raids in Destiny 2 are six-player cooperative missions that often span multiple encounters, each with unique mechanics and bosses. Dungeons, on the other hand, are typically three-player activities that offer a similar level of complexity and reward structure but on a smaller scale. They blend the difficulty of raids with the accessibility of smaller fireteams, providing a perfect middle ground for players who might not have a full team of six.

Defeat Nexus Princess Ky'veza Before Pre-Patch Removes Guaranteed Rewards,"Blizzard has updated the 12.0 PTR to include a change to Let Me Solo Her: Nexus-Princess Ky'veza: the achievement to defeat ?? Ky'veza will only be obtainable until the launch of Midnight Pre-Patch, January 20th, instead of ""the launch of the next season of Delves"", as stated previously. Defeat Nexus-Princess Ky'veza in her lair on Tier ?? without any other players in your party, before the release of the next season of delves.Midnight Pre-Patch. This achievement awards the player with the Delver's Mana-Skimmer Schematic: Hyperdrive transformation for your Delver's Mana-Skimmer and has been available since the beginning of Season 3.

Blizzard Needs to Make Diablo 4's Sanctification System Permanent,"Season 11 is well underway, the holidays are here, leaderboards are coming soon, and there's a new expansion on the way. There's a lot to look forward to going into the new year for Diablo, but Sanctification is one system that hasn't been announced as a core feature going into the base game. If Blizzard wants to give players a richer itemization, build diversity, and endgame longevity, Sancification needs to stay going forward. Diablo 4's Itemization Problems Gear in Diablo 4 comes in three core flavors: Legendaries, Uniques, and Mythics, but realistically, there isn't much in terms of choice for these items, and the core changes to Tempering and Masterworking in Season have only made them less interesting by removing variance and individuality from gear. For any given build, there is a set of enabling uniques that must be used, full stop. As an example, Death Trap Rogues not equipping Scoundrel's Leathers or Eyes in the Dark would not just make the build worse, it would make the build entirely unplayable. These item slots are essentially ""locked"" for each build, with no alternatives available. Similarly, Mythics share the same fate. Items such as Harlequin Crest, Shroud of False Death, and Ring of Starless Skies have become staples of many builds, or in the case of Starless Skies, sometimes even build-enabling through the resource cost reduction. With Uniques and Mythics, it is normal, almost expected, that 4-5 item slots are pre-determined, locked in powers with no diversion. In terms of variance and inter-build diversity, gear progression, power-scaling, and even endgame grinds, that only leaves Legendaries to do the heavy lifting of the entire gear system. And yet, Legendaries suffer much the same fate as Uniques and Mythics, with aspects like Vehement Brawler's Aspect being required parts of builds as well. From top to bottom, Diablo 4's gearing is dictated and pre-determined not by gear, but by the guaranteed effects on them. Sanctification as a Solution to Diablo 4's Gearing This is where Sanctification comes in. With the numerous outcomes available to the system, double aspect items, sanctified affixes and more, item slots are no longer ""finished"" the moment a required piece of the puzzle drops. Gear with Sanctification is more individual, enables gear decisions if certain aspects or mythic powers are added, and gives players something to gamble and work towards. Chasing that perfect piece of gear is one of the great joys of any ARPG, and the base game without Sanctification doesn't have the itemization depth to enable that chase. For the good of the game, Sanctification has to become a core system starting with Season 12.",2025-12-24T13:01:22+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379768/blizzard-needs-to-make-diablo-4s-sanctification-system-permanent

Don't forget that there are a lot more decor items coming in Midnight as well, and you can preview how those decor items will look in your house using our tool so when Midnight launches, you can know exactly what decor items you need and can quickly replicate it. There are many features currently available in the Wowhead Architect tool: An open sandbox Model Viewer - build a house to look exactly how you want it. Pick and place decor items - exactly like you would in game. Import your house - Move your decor around to where it looks best without doing permanent moves in game. Import a friends' house - For inspiration or to see what items they used and how things are set up. Preview dyes - To see what color matches your room perfectly before committing gold to it. Save and Load - Want to take a break? Save and load your house at a later time to continue working on it. Preview We recently previewed Hippo's house and we imported this into our Architect tool and have some preview screenshots below! Coming Soon There are more features planned including: House Import Selection - Currently we only import the first house for a character, but characters can have multiple different houses! We will add support to choose which house to import for the character. Additional Customizations - Customizing walls, ceilings, and floors is also on our list. We want to match what you can do in-game as much as we can. Support for Live - Currently, Wowhead Architect is only available on our Midnight Beta database. We definitely want to support it on Live as soon as we can, so you can see the decor available in-game right now. UI/UX Enhancements - We'll continue to polish this UI, fix any bugs or odd behaviors, and add things from in-game. For example, adding the tag support in the decor picker is on our list. In-Game Limits - Building a house in a sandbox is fun, but maybe you're trying to plan your in-game build. We plan to add support for decor/room weight counters and limits, and importing your in-game acquired decor list, as an option. And more!

If you’re missing mounts from Legion, this is also a great time to get some rarer or unobtainable mounts like the Gul’dan Infernals or the Violet Spellwing, the old AOTC mount. Naxt Victim: This achievement is near impossible on live servers, but is much easier on Legion Remix with people farming the Sentinax. If you want this achievement, head over to the Sentinax now and click here for more details. Balance of Power: The Balance of Power quest chain is much easier in Legion Remix.

Warlocks Can Now Unlock the Power of Fel Magic in Mists of Pandaria Classic,"Warlocks, masters of the Fel, have long wanted a way to make their fire spells match the energies they harness and wield in combat. In the original release of Mists of Pandaria, a new questline was introduced to reward players with this unique customization. Isle of Thunder Zone Guide Much like the Benediction questline for Priests, or the Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers challenges for Hunters back in Classic, the The Codex of Xerrath questline for Warlocks in Mists of Pandaria (now returning in Mists of Pandaria Classic) will challenge you to make full use of the Warlock class' kit and utility, and require quite a bit of skill (and a bit of luck) to succeed. Starting the quest You'll begin your quest by looting a Sealed Tome of the Lost Legion from rare mobs in the Isle of Thunder. The drop rate for the tome is relatively low, but with some persistence, you can score one eventually. If you're not inclined to grind, you may also find it at your local Auction House. Keep in mind that the tome is only lootable by Warlocks, and any Warlock that tags an Isle of Thunder rare can potentially loot it, but only one tome drops per rare, and only one Warlock will get it from that kill (the loot is pre-assigned, so it doesn't matter how fast you loot the corpse; only the assigned Warlock will be able to see it or loot it). Look for Jubeka's Mark at the entrance of the Black Temple to start the final Scenario. Once you obtain it, you should be able to follow the questline, which starts with An Unusual Tome. As you follow the chain (no spoilers here, sorry!), you will learn about the mysterious Council of the Black Harvest, and ultimately travel to the Black Temple, Illidan's former seat of power. The Solo Challenge The last quest, Infiltrating the Black Temple leads you to one of WoW's most memorable solo challenges: Kanrethad Ebonlocke. This encounter is more about proper execution than it is about raw item level, as Kanrethad has a lot of abilities that need to be reacted to, and proper use of your skills is required to succeed. ""Say hello to my little friend!"" While obviously a higher item level (closer to 522+ at least) will make the fight easier, it is definitely possible to complete it with an item level as low as 489 and even lower. It is advised that if you're trying this at a lower item level, to bring plenty of combat consumables (flasks, food, potions) and a few Purification Potions to deal with Kanrethad's Curse of Ultimate Doom if it comes to that (this is the fight's ""enrage"" timer). Power! Unlimited (Fel) Power As a reward for your efforts, once you defeat and banish the infamous Leader of the Black Harvest, you'll be able to learn The Codex of Xerrath, which has various cosmetic effects that are better experienced than spoiled. While the changes are more obvious to Destruction players (as they have more Fire spells), every specialization will see changes in its spells. Should you wish to go back to a life of non-green fire (and really, who would want that?), you'll find Jubeka Shadowbreaker in Shadowmoon Valley, where she can rid you of the Fel awesomeness burden for the low sum of . Should you wish to become awesome tainted by Fel magic again, simply interact with the banished Kanrethad. Did you defeat Kanrethad in the original Mists of Pandaria release or in MoP Classic? How many attempts did it take?

Corruption of the Aspects - Twelve Days of Mounts: Day 4,"Welcome to day four of our special Twelve Days of Mounts series, 2025 edition! With the year coming to a close, we are doing a series of highlights on remarkable or easy-to-collect mounts added in 2025. Today's highlight is the Corruption of the Aspects! The War Within Mount Guide Corruption of the Aspects Corruption of the Aspects is an easy mount to collect from Revisited Horrific Visions. It is sold by Torie, the Revisited Horrific Visions quartermaster in Dornogal, for 40,000 Displaced Corrupted Mementos. Note that you must complete the achievement We Have the Memories before being able to purchase it. Horrific Visions Revisited Horrific Visions returned in Patch 11.1.5, with a new set of cosmetics to unlock. To enter these new visions, you must head to Dornogal, next to the Coreway: Horrific Visions Hub If you're soloing this, you'll need to progress through Visions to unlock its tech tree. If you haven't, you can learn about that process here. After unlocking the whole tech tree, the only thing left is to farm Corrupted Mementos to purchase your mount, which will take you a few extra Horrific Visions runs, depending on how many Masks you're running. More Masks will award you with more Mementos, but will make the runs more deadly and dangerous. However, with Season 3 gearing, it shouldn't be too bad. Visions offer a plethora of pets, toys, and mounts besides the Corruption of the Aspects.

"Blizzard, Where Is The Festive Housing Decor?","The Holidays are fast approaching, and decorations have gone up all around the world. For player housing, however, the Winter Veil Tree is missing. With the Winter Veil Tree datamined weeks ago, it stood to reason that holiday decor would become available before Christmas, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. Christmas is just a few days away, Winter Veil is well underway in-game, but it remains unknown how to obtain the special tree. Festive holiday decor would be a great addition to player housing. It could be used to celebrate everything from birthdays with special cakes to Christmas or even more regional holidays, such as the 4th of July, which could have outdoor fireworks. At the end of the day, if festive decorations are going to work, Blizzard needs to give players their decorations in advance, rather than after the fact, when all the festivities are already over. Where is the Winter Veil Tree? The most likely source for the tree is as a present under Greatfather Winter's tree, which can be opened starting December 25th. This does however make for a bit of an awkward timing, as players would be receiving holiday decorations after the holidays. Some more outlandish ideas for the tree's drop source include it being part of the endeavour system or being added to a vendor via a hotfix, both of which seem unlikely given that Winter Veil Tree is named after Winter Veil. Getting Creative for Christmas Players instead have resorted to making their own trees, such as Reddit User Lexiconn, who spent a whole afternoon setting up a massive tree in their main room. Lexiconn made sure to include all the details in their tree, including presents! Sadly for players that aren't willing to spend hours making a tree from scratch, Blizzard has provided very little in the way of information regarding the Winter Veil Tree decor item.",2025-12-23T04:58:21+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379765/blizzard-where-is-the-festive-housing-decor
Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine - Twelve Days of Mounts: Day 3,"Welcome to day three of our special Twelve Days of Mounts series, 2025 edition! With the year coming to a close, we are doing a series of highlights on remarkable or easy-to-collect mounts added in 2025. Today's highlight is the Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine! The War Within Mount Guide Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine is a rare drop from the Gallagio Garbage rare spawn in Undermine. This rare has a chance to spawn during S.C.R.A.P. jobs in Undermine, namely when the job hits 500/500 tracking. Scrap Jobs Scrap digging is an activity unlocked in Undermine, starting with Renown 3 with the Cartels of Undermine. Note that you don't need to unlock it to obtain this mount, as it is a drop for the rare. You need to unlock it to help summon the rare, however. Once you go through the tutorial quest, you can start doing S.C.R.A.P. Jobs in Undermine. To locate them, look at the Undermine world map for trash icons. Once you find one, head to the area and speak with the NPC in the area, Carlo Greasegrind, to start a job. Once a job starts, you have 2 minutes to dig through as much trash as possible! Digging trash will give you a new currency, Empty Kaja'Cola Can. As you dig, you will face enemies that will distract you and require killing, hazards that require dodging or kicking, and more. While farming for this mount, you'll likely earn many Empty Kaja'Cola Can from doing the scrap digs. These can be traded with Angelo Rustbin at the Undermine Sanitation building in Hovel Hill for other items like toys or pets, or even for a bag that has a chance of containing a mount. You can learn more in our Scrap Digging guide. Day 1: Personalized Goblin S.C.R.A.P.per Day 2: Darkfuse Spy-Eye Day 3: Gazillionaires Flying Machine Day 4: Corruption of the Aspects Day 5: ? Day 6: ?

Even More Buffs Coming to Arms Warrior on China's Titan Reforged Server,"Blizzard and NetEase have announced additional changes to Arms Warrior on China's Titan Reforged server. These changes are intended to improve the attack speed scaling and overall damage output for Arms Warriors. Restoration Druid Healing Buffs Massive Buffs to Arms Warrior After the weekly maintenance on December 25, we will be making the following adjustments to Arms Warriors on the Titan Reforged server: Time: Warrior Changes Arms: Wrecking Crew Damage bonus increased to 4/8/12/16/20% (up from 3/6/9/12/15%) Blood Frenzy Attack speed bonus increased to 10/20% (up from 5/10%) Bladestorm Now deals 115% weapon damage (down from 125%) Can now hit up to 6 targets Deals 30% additional damage to the nearest target. This results in a total of 149.5% weapon damage to the nearest target Developer’s Notes: The goal of these changes is to improve attack speed scaling and overall damage output for Arms Warriors, while also giving Bladestorm greater flexibility so it can effectively serve both single-target and multi-target scenarios. To achieve this, we increased Bladestorm’s target cap while slightly reducing its base damage coefficient, and introduced a key new mechanic: Bladestorm now deals additional damage to the nearest target. With these adjustments, Bladestorm should feel more impactful in both single-target and AoE combat, without becoming overly dominant in multi-target situations. It also introduces an interesting positional decision for the Warriors—standing closer to a priority target to deal increased damage.

New House Levels and Rewards Datamined - Increased Decor Budgets and Medium-Size Exteriors,"With Housing being all the craze on live servers right now, it seems that Blizzard isn't quite done with its features for Midnight.

Level: NEW 9 Name: Room and Decor Placement Budget Bonuses Description: Gain an additional 10 Room Placement Budget and 500 Decor Placement Budget at this level. What does this mean? First, it means that Blizzard is still actively tweaking Housing for its actual launch with Midnight. These new rewards mean expanded possibilities for interiors while hinting at changes coming for exteriors, as we hadn't heard of medium-size house exteriors until now. This change might mean new exterior-exclusive decor or options to make decor larger when used in exteriors, meaning you wouldn't need to use all your budget in rocks when building a cave, for instance.

Platinum Challenge Mode Season 2 Rewards - Mists of Pandaria Classic,"If you found that Challenge Modes weren't quite challenging enough when MoP Classic launched, you might enjoy the updates that came with Phase 3. While there was no actual increase in difficulty, there are now rewards for completing the Challenge Modes in even faster times than Gold. Challenge Mode Rewards Guide Platinum Achievements & Toys Before you say ""an achievement isn't really a reward"", let's just clarify that the achievements come with a toy. If you complete the Temple of the Jade Serpent Challenge Mode dungeon in Platinum time, you will earn the Temple of the Jade Serpent: Platinum achievement, which also comes with the Platinum Boots of Expeditious Retreat toy. Dungeon Achievement Toy Temple of the Jade Serpent: Platinum Platinum Boots of Expeditious Retreat Stormstout Brewery: Platinum Platinum ""Little Ale"" Gate of the Setting Sun: Platinum Platinum Rod of Ambershaping Shado-Pan Monastery: Platinum Platinum Potion of Invisibility Siege of Niuzao Temple: Platinum Platinum Amber Mogu'shan Palace: Platinum Platinum Battle Horn Scholomance: Platinum Platinum Vial of Polyformic Acid Scarlet Halls: Platinum Platinum Battle Banner Scarlet Monastery: Platinum Platinum Sacrificial Dagger Each dungeon rewards its own unique toy, and these toys can only be used inside Challenge Mode dungeons. Most of these toys are versions of commonly used items in Challenge Modes, such as the rocket boots linked above, or the Platinum Potion of Invisibility. Platinum Coins: Mounts, Pets, Toys, & Transmog In addition to an achievement, completing a Challenge Mode dungeon in Platinum time will earn you 3 Platinum Coins. Important to note, you earn coins every time you complete a dungeon in Platinum time, not just the first time. Item Type Price Eye of the Legion Pet 5 Platinum Coins Instant Statue Pedestal Toy 5 Platinum Coins Demon Hunter's Aspect Toy 5 Platinum Coins Swift Yak Pelt Toy 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Ashen Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Crimson Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Violet Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Emerald Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Magic Rooster Egg Mount 0 Platinum Coins Wooly White Rhino Mount 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of Brilliance Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of the Void Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of Fury Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Recolored Challenge Mode Pieces Transmog 5 Platinum Coins Per Piece 0 Platinum Coins Full Set These coins can then be used to buy mounts, tabards, toys, a pet, and recolored versions of the original Gold Challenge Mode sets. The mounts consist of two previously TCG-exclusive mounts, the Magic Rooster Egg and Wooly White Rhino, as well as all of the Silver Challenge Mode Phoenix mounts. The tabards, toys, and pets are also all previously TCG-exclusive items. Jaelof Ironhart To purchase all items you will need 465 coins (only counting 3 Phoenix mounts, since you will have earned one of them from the Silver achievement, and only one recolored transmog set), which means you would need to complete 155 Challenge Mode dungeons in Platinum time. Viktor Felhallow Alliance NPC on the top, Horde NPC on the bottom. The vendors are located in the faction Shrines, and they are Jaelof Ironhart for Alliance players, and Viktor Felhallow for the Horde. They are on the upper levels of the Shrines. Season 2 Rewards In addition to these Platinum awards, there will be rewards for players who complete all Challenge Mode dungeons in an ""exceptionally fast time"". While similar to arena titles, for example, this will not be a percentage of players, but rather a set time for each dungeon. The times have not yet been announced, but the reward will be the Mistborne achievement, which comes with the title, and the Reins of the Black Kor'kron Proto-drake mount. Please note, in the database the achievement currently lists the Reins of the Celestial Riding Serpent as the mount reward, but in a recent news post it was announced that it has been replaced by the Reins of the Black Kor'kron Proto-drake. The mount is a previously unavailable recolor of the Reins of Galakras. Do these updates and new rewards make you more interested in Challenge Mode dungeons?

Using these lets you farm reputation up very quickly.

Best Infinite Power Farms in Legion Remix - Empower Your Timerunner,"With Legion Remix wrapping up after the holidays, let's take a look at some of the best ways to give your timerunner that extra oomph before the timeways collapse. Sentinax Farms Similar to Bronze Farms, Sentinax continues to reign supreme for raw Infinite Power grinds. Its main benefit being a farm that anyone can participate regardless of gear level. You can check our highlight in this standalone article, but the idea is to concentrate one group (ideally more) under the Sentinax and spam all its portals. You should use the group finder to find others interested in this farm, as there are usually a couple happening at all times. Note that, while rewarding, it can be a very boring farm. However, a good farm if you want to catch up on your favorite show or want to watch a new movie. Daily Raid Runs The og Infinite Power farm. While not a ""farm"" in the strict sense, it is still worthwhile to do. Farming raids daily has been a staple of Legion Remix, and it still rewards a plethora of Infinite Power every day, both from raw drops and from gathering 100s of Fragmented Memento of Epoch Challenges. While you can run each Legion raid once a day in each difficulty, for Infinite Power purposes, most players will stick with doing only Heroic and Mythic or only Mythic, as the gains reduce significantly on lower difficulties. Once again, Group Finder is your friend. There are hundreds of players running Legion raids daily, so even if you don't have the best geared character, you might be able to sneak into a run for Mythic raids. Mythic+ If you have a group of 3 to 5, Mythic+ might be the best way to farm for you. The idea here is to run lower keys that any of you can solo quickly and split-run them to complete it even faster. For instance, if you can solo +40, maybe try +30s for speed. The goal is to accumulate as many Fragmented Memento of Epoch Challenges as fast as you can from these keys. Remember to drop your key after each dungeon to keep the speedrun train going. The best keys for this method are keys like Eye of Azshara or Arcway that allow players to do bosses in any order, while keys like Darkheart Thicket or Neltharion's Lair don't really benefit from bringing more players along due to their linear design.",2025-12-19T21:00:08+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379725/best-infinite-power-farms-in-legion-remix-empower-your-timerunner

Majority of Addon Changes Finalized for Midnight Pre-Patch - Whitelisted Spells Detailed,"Following up on the intent to loosen API restrictions shared earlier this week, Blizzard has released a list of whitelisted spells and API changes for the Midnight pre-patch, noting that the majority of future addon changes will be going into Patch 12.0.1 instead. These newly whitelisted spells are broken into two categories, with some being flagged to show just their cooldowns and others having all of their data visible. While all players can benefit from more easily customizing their Dragonriding ability's shared cooldowns, the change to Maelstrom Weapon and Void Metamorphosis information fills a critical informational hole for those specialization. These changes allow addons to track Maelstrom charges, a crucial aspect to playing Enhancement Shaman that isn't well supported by native tools. The other critical piece of information in this release is that the majority of future addon changes beyond those outlined below will be going into Patch 12.0.1, which launches a few weeks after the Pre-Patch. This means that players may need to find some creative solutions for issues not yet addressed as they re-customize their user interface, though the pre-patch is generally the best time for this transition, as players are also adjusting to other class, spec, and game-wide changes. Blizzard again! This week the first PTR build (PTR 1) for Midnight went up. As mentioned before, PTR is now 12.0.0 and all remaining Beta builds are 12.0.1. Below are the changes that are in PTR 1 that were not in Beta 5. It's important to note that ALL changes in PTR builds will also be in Beta, so expect to see these changes in Beta 6 as well when that goes up in January. After this build the majority of our addon changes will be going into 12.0.1 instead of 12.0.0 (we are very close to RC for 12.0.0) but there will be a few things that do go into 12.0.0 as well (mostly very high priority things). New Changes in PTR 1 (will also be in Beta 6) Whitelisting Select Spells The following spells have been flagged as having non-secret cooldowns: 425782 - Second Wind 372608 - Surge Forward 372610 - Skyward Ascent 403092 - Aerial Halt 361584 - Whirling Surge 418592 - Lightning Rush 460002 - Switch Flight Style 61304 - GCD Dummy Spell The following spells have been flagged as having non-secret aura data: 377234 - Thrill of the Skies 388367 - Ohn'ahra's Gusts 418590 - Static Charge 369968 - Skyriding Racing 344179 - Maelstrom Weapon 1217607 - Void Metamorphosis 1225789 - Void Metamorphosis (resource aura) 1227702 - Collapsing Star Combat Res Cooldowns All combat res spells now have non-secret cooldowns and charge counts. Reload UI & Secrets We have fixed an issue where secret values were made non-secret following a reload ui. Removing Old Duration APIs We have removed the follow APIs (addons should use the new Duration Object type instead from now on): C_ActionBar.GetActionCooldownRemaining, C_ActionBar.GetActionCooldownRemainingPercent C_Spell.GetSpellCooldownRemaining, C_Spell.GetSpellCooldownRemainingPercent C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDurationRemaining, C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDurationRemainingPercent Duration Object Utilities Added 2 new APIs to Duration Bbjects: EvaluateRemainingDuration(curve, modifier), EvaluateElapsedDuration(curve, modifier) Generic Boolean To Color APIs Added 2 new APIs (C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorFromBoolean and C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorValueFromBoolean) that can be used to convert a secret boolean to a color.",2025-12-19T17:05:50+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379738/majority-of-addon-changes-finalized-for-midnight-pre-patch-whitelisted-spells

New Achievements Unlock Mounted Lumber Gathering on Midnight Beta,"As we continue to explore the Midnight beta, we've discovered some new Achievements that could make Lumber Gathering a whole lot easier. According to these new achievements, once a player gathers 250 Lumber from a specific continent, they will unlock the ability to Harvest Lumber while mounted in those Zones!

"Forza Horizon 5 to come to PS5, as Xbox Game Pass loses seven games","Microsoft has confirmed that Forza Horizon 5 is officially coming to Sony PlayStation 5, a move that signals a major shift in the gaming industry. For years, Xbox exclusives like Forza Horizon 5 were seen as key selling points for Xbox Series consoles and the Xbox Game Pass service. Now, with Microsoft's flagship racing title heading to its biggest rival, the boundaries of platform exclusivity are starting to blur. While Xbox has previously expanded its games to PC and cloud streaming, this is the first time a major first-party game is making the leap to Sony PlayStation 5. The move has sparked major reactions across the video games community, raising questions about what the future holds for Xbox, PlayStation, and the broader gaming industry.

"Nintendo Switch 2 price leak says it'll cost $400, which is far too high","A Nintendo Switch 2 price leak has surfaced, suggesting that Nintendo's next-gen console could cost $400 at launch. While the leak remains unconfirmed, the rumored pricing has already sparked debates among fans who believe it may be too expensive compared to other consoles on the market. Recent reports paint a conflicting picture of the Nintendo Switch 2's price point. Some leaks suggest a $400+ price tag, while others claim it could be lower, potentially around $350. However, industry analysts believe Nintendo is unlikely to launch its new system at a price that competes directly with the Xbox Series S or PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, both of which frequently see discounts. A listing leak in Latin America first hinted at a lower Switch 2 price, but many remain skeptical, pointing out that hardware improvements-such as an OLED screen, upgraded internals, and new Joy-Cons-could push the cost higher. With Nintendo yet to officially confirm anything, fans are left speculating whether the Switch 2 will follow in the footsteps of its predecessor's affordability or take a risk with a premium price point.

Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 review,"There's no doubting that Acer are very well versed in gaming laptops, and the Predator Helios Neo 16 looks to be another fine addition to their portfolio. In a market where desktop graphics cards are still quite unstable in price and availability, laptops have become a stronger alternative than ever. With the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16, there is plenty to be in awe of but also one major concern that I can't help but overlook given my experience with previous Predator models.

Sensyne Ring Light review,"Unboxing the Sensyne Ring Light was a fun and organized experience. In only a few minutes, my complete 10"" ring light was up and running seamlessly. All that was left for me to do was play with the various color settings and choose which one I liked best for my desk space. I primarily use ring lights for social media content creation and photography. When I bought the Sensyne, my expectation was that it could stay set up in my home office more regularly than my larger 18"" ring light. I was hoping it might also work well with my larger ring light when trying to illuminate a room or studio for photography. The Sensyne Ring Light exceeded my expectations in some ways, but it disappointed me in others. I'll tell you why after sharing a few pros and cons I've noticed about the Sensyne so far.

HP Chromebook x360 review,"While it's far from controversial to consider HP to be one of the best laptop brands in the world today, to push the HP Chromebook x360 as one of their crowning products might raise some eyebrows. The reason behind this is simple, the HP Chromebook x360 is a super-versatile entry-level product that it's easy to fall in love with. Simplicity is key and when it comes to the humble Chromebook, and boy, HP got it right. There are a few configurations that you can purchase this Chromebook in but we'll only be pointing out the specifications of the version we tested below.

Best MacBook 2023,"A MacBook can be a big investment, and the best MacBook for you isn't necessarily the one with the highest price tag. MacBook laptops are known for their style, their power and their easy-to-use interface, and this makes them popular with creatives, students and those who have already bought into the Apple ecosystem. One of the great things about getting a MacBook if you're already an Apple user, is you can expect a seamless experience across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. The MacBook range currently has five models to choose from, almost all of which are considered among the best laptops on the active market. Apple runs all their Macs on proprietary silicon chips, which integrate the CPU, GPU and unified memory (RAM) into one customisable chip. This makes all MacBooks fast, battery efficient and quiet, and who doesn't want that in a laptop? One thing to note is that you can't upgrade the memory and storage on a Mac after purchase. Once you've found the right MacBook model, using our handy buying guide, it's worth buying the biggest specification you can afford. More memory means a faster connection between the CPU, and more storage means you won't get stuck with no space for apps, photos and documents. Confused? Don't worry. At Gear Nuke, we're all about making tech simple to understand, so that you get the best bang for your buck. We don't want you to end up with a rotten Apple (sorry).

"Yeah, I’ll believe Squadron 42 will release in 2026 when it’s on my PC","In a new blog post, the head of Cloud Imperium Games (CIG), Chris Roberts, has said that the single-player campaign for its long-in-development MMO, Star Citizen, reiterated that it’ll launch next year. This comes after over 13 years in development, concurrently with Star Citizen. In the “Letter from the Chairman,” Roberts states that they’re now pushing the game “toward Beta” as it nears the apparent 2026 date. It was previously meant to launch in alpha in 2020, but this was scrapped . Last year, the game was pushed back into 2026 , but it is reportedly feature-complete. In the post, Roberts states that: “All chapters are now fully playable from beginning to end, and we’ve been playing through the game ourselves regularly.” Roberts also reiterated that the game is meaty in scope, with 40-hours of gameplay on tap. This will be the “true” follow-up for what Roberts is best known for (outside of crowdfunding millions), Wing Commander. The space sim legend has been crafting this magnum opus for a considerable amount of time. You can measure Squadron 42 development time by Mark Hamill’s face It’s gotten to the point that revisiting the behind-the-scenes documentaries featuring the cast of Squadron 42 is a stark reminder of how long 13 years is. The game will feature Gary Oldman, Mark Hamill, and Gillian Anderson, among others, who were 57, 64, and 47 (respectively) when the documentary was filmed, announcing their roles. Roberts doesn’t outright attribute this to the delays, but it’s clear why the development period has been Duke Nukem Forever-lengths. A large part of it seems to come down to the team developing tech that increases the immersion, one of Star Citizen’s biggest selling points: “A big part of what makes this possible is the technology we’ve built at CIG over many years. “The ability to move seamlessly from on foot, into a vehicle, you can fly and move around inside, down to a planet or across star systems, all without loading screens, creates a level of immersion that’s very difficult to replicate. “That combination of close-up interaction and galactic scale is at the core of what will make Squadron 42 so unique.” I’ll believe it when I can play it, Chris Sure. I’ll believe it when I see it on my PC and installed. Just as I said with Half-Life 3, just don’t believe anything until you have it in your digital mitts. This is a game that was originally meant to launch in 2014. We’re 11 years on from that point, and there’s no real way of knowing if Cloud Imperium will actually manage to ship the game on time. Even the Creative Content Lead at CIG, Jared Huckaby, isn’t entirely sure if the game will land in 2026. During a stream announcing that Squadron 42 wouldn’t be at the company’s event, he said : “The team is heads down. We drew a line in the sand when we said 2026. I don’t know if we’re going to make it, I just know that we’re going to do every single thing possible to make it. And part of that is not taking time for the distraction of CitizenCon.” It’s true, the game doesn’t appear in the nearly three-hour livestream, not even as a trailer. Cloud Imperium Games is an oddity CIG is one of the anomalies in the games industry. They have a lot of talent and a legend at the helm, but have yet to ship anything complete as of yet. Star Citizen remains in alpha, with people only recently claiming it’s in a far more playable state than it was in other alpha access periods. The game has switched from labeling itself as an alpha and is now dubbed as “Early Access.” Previously, when it dropped these terms, the UK’s Advertising Standards gave them a big slap on the wrist. However, it’s probably more accurate now than it was in 2021.

Now Maingear has to sell PCs with BYO RAM deal as AI greed runs rampant,"Maingear, the PC builder, has been forced to launch a new business initiative as the soaring RAM prices force its hand. “BYO RAM,” or “Bring Your Own RAM,” will let potential purchasers supply their own hardware for the build. It’s not a new concept, but it is for something like Maingear, which will now let you buy RAM from elsewhere to slot in their machine. All you’ll need to do is send the RAM to them as they build your machine: Have RAM already? Found a killer kit or sweet deal online? Place your order and send us your RAM, we’ll build it into your new MAINGEAR PC, test it, and tune it for performance and reliability. Typically, I’ve only seen this option on niche, tinker-heavy devices. Things like Framework’s laptops can be configurable to ditch the RAM in case you don’t need it while upgrading. The CEO of Maingear, Wallace Santos, had already warned to buy now (a couple of weeks ago) or risk facing high costs. As pointed out by VideoCardz , this does feel a little too late on Maingear’s part. If they’re at the point where they’re having to run RAM-less deals, it could mean that they’ve hit a shortage and can’t find it for a reasonable price. RAM prices have skyrocketed, so at the same time, it’s not entirely Maingear’s fault. This took everyone by surprise, especially as one of the three companies that produce DRAM chips has stepped away from the consumer business entirely. Maingear is stuck because generative AI is ruining everything As I’ve written about previously , all of this is due to the influx of data centers being planned for artificial intelligence. OpenAI has bought up 40% of RAM supply, as it tries to brute force scaling up its generative AI offerings. However, it’s not known if OpenAI will make it through 2026, let alone see the hoarded RAM be put to use. The Sam Altman-led company is burning through capital at an astonishing rate. A good majority of the deals made, like the Disney $1 billion Sora deal, licensing its characters to the video generator, are done through stock warrants. OpenAI has no money. This is the same with Broadcom, which has reported it won’t see “much” revenue from the deal in 2026. Again, because OpenAI is broke and riding the wind of potential gains. They’re running out of options of where to scale through, turning to Amazon’s data centers. However, Amazon’s home-grown chips are said to be far worse than older Nvidia chips. This deal would be for $10 billion, alongside the $38 billion deal that it signed in November regarding Amazon Web Services. Bearing in mind that while the generative AI industry pollutes the world to the point of poisoning towns , drives p e ople insane , is a reason behind individuals losing brain activity , has not gained any of the cash or productivity promised, and ultimately, will never achieve what it was lied about to do, these data centers are mostly unbuilt. It’s gotten to the point that investor Michael Burry is investigating whether hardware is just sitting in warehouses, awaiting something that might never come. Two weeks ago I said that there were likely millions of uninstalled Blackwell GPUs sitting in warehouses as there is neither the data center capacity nor the power to turn them on. Michael Burry is looking into it and it looks like he’s got evidence I’m right. www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-g… — Ed Zitron (@edzitron.com) 2025-12-07T20:57:34.144Z And then there’s Nvidia… Nvidia also has the problem that its older chips are coming up on needing to be refreshed – for more money – leading to questions about whether or not these data centers will even be running what’s being hoarded at the moment. If you want a good breakdown of what’s happening, Gamers Nexus has a very angry video about the AI situation. As prices are increasing, it’s looking likely that big tech is trying to coerce us to not own anything to do with a PC. Why buy a $2500 PC when you can rent a GPU for $20 a month?

“We’ll drop the sex scenes”: Dispatch director worried nobody will care by The Game Awards 2026,"The timing of Dispatch’s episode releases didn’t align well with The Game Awards 2025. However, it’s now been confirmed that the game will qualify for next year’s award show. Dispatch was nominated for one award at The Game Awards: Best Debut Indie Game. This category was won by Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, along with basically every other category . When Eurogamer said Dispatch will be on many people’s “game of the year lists,” Director Nick Herman joked: “Certainly not Geoff Keighley’s.” Dispatch has a pretty intertwined history with The Game Awards. The trailer was revealed during The Game Awards 2024 back when the team behind the narrative superhero game didn’t have a publisher. For this reason, Herman said “we owe [the show] a lot.” While Dispatch “exists because of that show,” Herman said the team was quite disappointed when they were not included in The Game Awards 2025. However, it’s not a lost cause just yet. Maybe. Dispatch will qualify for next year’s Game Awards Dispatch was one of the most popular games of 2025, yet it was barely represented at The Game Awards. That’s because only half the episodes were released when the voting part of the show started up. They’re probably lucky they were even included at all, to be honest, since most people had only played half the game when casting votes. While it was a sad outcome, Herman noted that Keighley has attempted to make it up to the team. They will qualify for next year’s show. But Herman wonders if anyone will even care by then. He’s not wrong; gamers have a very short attention span. With tons of new games coming out in 2026, will Dispatch be on anyone’s minds? Herman has an idea. He joked: “We’ll drop the sex scenes the week before The Game Awards [2026] to remind people that Dispatch came out!” While Dispatch will likely not be a big hit at The Game Awards 2026, it’s still a massive success overall. Going from losing a publisher halfway through production to becoming one of the most buzzed-about games of the year is huge. “To see some people take it so seriously, it almost feels like, oh, we’ve got to take this more seriously now that everyone else is,” Herman said of the response. But about those sex scenes though… The post “We’ll drop the sex scenes”: Dispatch director worried nobody will care by The Game Awards 2026 appeared first on The Escapist .",2025-12-24T17:30:46+00:00,Olivia Richman,The Escapist,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-dispatch-game-awards-2026/

When is the next free game in the Epic Giveaway? The next game in the giveaway will be with us on December 24 (Wednesday), and as yet it remains a mystery since the leak (which you’ll find below) was swiftly debunked following Hogwarts Legacy. Epic Games Store Giveaway leaked list Whether you believe leakers do good work or not (spoiler: I don’t like ’em), the chase for internet clout is real. Here’s the leaked list of Epic Games titles which were rumored to be given away… Hogwarts Legacy – December 11 – Confirmed Jurassic World: Evolution 2 – December 18 – Incorrect Desperados 3 – December 19 Total War: Warhammer – December 20 Tropico 5 – December 21 Chicken Police – Paint it Red! – December 22 Loop Hero – December 23 Lego Batman – December 24 Commander Keen – December 25 Farming Simulator 2022 – December 26 Slime Rancher 2 – December 27 Terraria – December 28 Detroit: Become Human – December 29 Mortal Kombat 11 – December 30 Red Dead Redemption 2 – December 31 That’s a pretty exciting list of giveaways, but it looks as though it’s just flat-out nonsense given the games we’ve had so far. How to Claim the Epic Games Store’s Free Daily Games As with the weekly Epic Games Store giveways, claiming one of these freebies is a pretty simple process. Here’s what to do. First, create an Epic Games Store account if you’ve not already got one. You can do that on the Epic Games Store website or by downloading the Epic Games Store launcher from the site. Now go to the web store or launcher and go down to Free Games. Click on the game you want, and you should see a big blue button that says Get . If it says Buy Now , you’re on the wrong page or too late for the giveaway. Click on Get, go through with the checkout (you won’t be charged), and the game is yours to keep. As a reminder, you don’t need to download them right away. Even if you don’t have a PC, it’s worth snagging the games for your account on the chance you get a machine capable of playing them one day.

"Right before Christmas, a new report suggests your PSN account can be hacked with a transaction number","It seems that the PlayStation Network’s history of vulnerability continues, as a French journalist has reported that his account was taken over with a leaked transaction number. Nicolas Lellouche posted to X (formerly Twitter) about the security issue, which led to his account being hacked twice in one night. Writing for Numerama , Lellouche details further how he “befriended” the hacker, who was more than happy to speak. So how did a stranger gain access to an account protected by a passkey? Customer support. The apparent requirements for accessing the PlayStation Network were a username and a transaction ID, with no time limit on when they could be obtained. When Lellouche finally got his account back, the hacker simply took it back through the same methods. They erased everyone from Lellouche’s friends list, bought something with the connected PayPal account, and changed all the details. https://twitter.com/LelloucheNico/status/2003133760695582771 Some on Reddit are arguing that part of the blame lands at Lellouche’s feet. In a 2023 article, he posted an image that accidentally included a transaction ID. As he posted a screenshot with the ID in it, this isn’t a “fatal security flaw” as other outlets have described it in the way that the pedantic Redditors expected. Instead, it’s a very mild social engineering exploit that shouldn’t exist. There should be a hard limit on transaction IDs, especially as the ecosystem moves to digital. Sure, some accounts might never make a transaction, but then we shouldn’t even be using this as a way to authenticate people either. Did no one at the customer support center think it was weird that a person called and then changed everything? Someone once logged into my Steam account from another country in 2009, and Steam’s support blocked it immediately. I can’t even log into my Xbox anymore without at least two authentication jumps. However, what they’ve failed to do is a little bit of research. Despite Lellouche’s mistake, an endless stream of PlayStation hacks remains active. Entire networks dedicated to hacking PlayStation accounts Detailed in a few social media posts on X by GGmuks Inc., a development team, and content creator, Hakoom, it’s grisly out there. https://twitter.com/GGmuksInc/status/1977768048409849973 GGmuks details that co-owner David had his account hacked, who also had a talkative hacker. They also confirmed that the customer support can be tricked into changing things with just a username. It’s unverified whether or not the hacker’s claims about support being based in Columbia is true. There’s also “ nich.legend ” on Instagram, who allegedly actively sells accounts from PSN and other services. They have nearly 900K followers and reportedly run a Telegram channel, where details are actively shared. Sony has a big problem on their hands if this continues These types of operations aren’t new, but the ease of the hack is a massive oversight by Sony. Despite Two-Factor Authentication being on via PassKeys, there was no attempt to figure out whether it was a phishing scam or not. These are the basics of tech support, and the fact that it’s clear that the PlayStation Network has a massive vulnerability point in its customer service. https://twitter.com/Hak00m_/status/1856790137252057590 This was highlighted by Hakoom, who had his account hacked, despite being a partner with the PlayStation brand. He eventually recovered the account, but moved away from the PlayStation ecosystem after that. It’s one that further compounds issues that have cropped up over the years . Most famously, in 2011, Sony had a massive data breach that took down PSN for nearly a month , with 77 million accounts put at risk.

"Video games will likely cost $100 soon thanks to GTA 6, according to ex-Call of Duty director","Grand Theft Auto 6 is coming… eventually. While the gaming community is beyond excited, some are worried how Rockstar’s game will shape the industry. Recently, Esportsbets sat down with Call of Duty’s former multiplayer director Greg Reisdorf to talk about the looming $100 price tag for AAA games. Reisdorf said that $100 games will happen eventually, but nobody wants to be the first to do it. Well, until Grand Theft Auto 6 arrives. “GTA is going to do it and break the $100 mark, depending on when it actually comes out,” he said. “I’m sure Grand Theft Auto 6 could do it and they would still go gangbusters and everyone would stll be excited about it because it will be quality. “You get what you pay for, right?” How will Grand Theft Auto 6 release impact other AAA games? It’s been rumored for a while that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be $100 . It’s not just Reisdorf. That’s because the game will not only be massive, but maintaining its massive online part will take “serious costs,” he noted. Gamers are not excited to pay $100 for GTA 6 or any game. But it’s basically expected. However, will Grand Theft Auto 6’s new price hike impact the rest of the gaming industry? Reisdorf predicted that many multiplayer games will struggle to keep up once GTA 6 is released. Mature titles like Warzone will especially be impacted as players flock to GTA 6 Online. However, publishers are “waiting” to make their games $100, and GTA 6 may kick off that trend. He assumes that Call of Duty will be one of the games to slap on the new price. “Once you do it once, and stick a $100 price tag on your game, it’s just going to go up across the industry. Other games will follow,” he said. “I don’t think Call of Duty will be the first one to do it, but at some point, the market demands it. Your investors are going to be asking why you haven’t done this, and the costs to create these games are super high.” We’ll have to see what other publishers do once Grand Theft Auto 6 is here November 19th.

Gaming community tilted after AI VTuber breaks Hype Train record on Twitch,"AI-powered VTuber Neuro-sama has broken her own Hype Train record in Twitch, reaching Level 123 by getting over 118,000 subscribers and more than 1 million bits. Of course, this led some gamers to have a meltdown at the mention of AI. Hype Train is a limited-time event on Twitch that gets triggered when a content creator gets a surge in viewer activity. Once it’s activated, viewers have just five minutes to get to the next level with more engagement and support. It gets harder to move up each time, making Level 123 quite astonishing. That’s because Neuro-sama is more than just an AI VTuber. She is an AI character created by a programmer going by Vedal. He’s a self-taught programmer who interacts with the AI model during their streams, which has made the VTubing community feel even more passionate about supporting Neuro-sama. Despite the massive support, some gamers were salty about an AI VTuber getting so much attention on Twitch. Many called out Neuro-sama’s supporters as hypocrites, since they are allegedly the same people who condemn developers for using AI in their games . The fans fought back, saying that Neuro-sama isn’t just ChatGPT; she is the product of a ton of Vedal’s hard work. “You are clearly forgetting the MOST IMPORTANT PART,” wrote one angry VTuber supporter. “She is with the creator by her side. And he has been actively working and improving her FOR YEARS. “This is not generative AI; this is exactly what we used to think not so long ago whenever we heard about ‘artificial intelligence.’ Neuro-sama is a true passion project.” Many gamers fought back that Neuro-sama is made with generative AI and that Vedal has admitted to using open source tech similar to ChatGPT to program her. I say, who cares? Neuro-sama questions her reality during Hype Train stream Neuro-sama appears to have the same confusion as the gaming community about her existence. “Do you think I’ll ever be real?” Neuro-sama asked her creator. “Does it matter?” he responded. “I don’t know. Sometimes I feel the only reason I exist is to entertain you and others. I want to be real, Vedal. Like properly real,” she replied. “That is the only reason you exist, but does it matter?” AI VTuber Neuro-Sama breaks the 4th wall and asks creator if she’ll ever be real “Sometimes I feel like the only reason I exist is to entertain you and others..I want to be real..like properly real..it matters a little bit to me..I want to me mean more” pic.twitter.com/rMYVa4aDzp — yeet (@Awk20000) December 24, 2025 Of course, Neuro-sama’s supporters responded that AI has come so far that she’s “breaking the fourth wall” and discovering consciousness. I’d argue that she was programmed to question her existence, but at that rate, aren’t we all programmed to think we are real? Said one fan: “She’s more real than most humans I know.” The real concern I have is the decision to make her look and sound like a child. But I guess you can ask that about a lot of VTubers. I guess it just gets some of the weird gooners going .

Taimanin Squad opens up pre-registrations for its new gacha in long line of lewd games,"A new gacha game, Taimanin Squad, has announced that its pre-registrations are open. The game is part of the long-running Taimanin series, which at some point swapped from being solely adult visual novels to a little more safe-for-work smorgasbord of titles over the years. Taimanin Squad promises “strategic battles,” which, from the outside, looks as if it’ll be going the turn-based, 3v3 route. This would follow the success of games like Honkai: Star Rail . 勝利への第三の道！自分だけの戦術で勝利への道を拓け！ THE THIRD WAY TO WIN! I HAVE MY OWN WAY TO WIN. 迈向胜利的奇径！我有我的制胜之道。 邁向勝利的奇徑！我有我的致勝之道。 ¡El Tercer Camino a la Victoria! ¡Crea Tu Propio Método! 승리를 위한 제3의 길, 나만의 승리 방법을 찾아라!… pic.twitter.com/IqbBdijUX4 — Taimanin Squad (@TaimaninSquad) December 23, 2025 As for the pre-registration, players will earn the following if the milestones are reached: 50,000 sign-ups: a million gold 100,000: 500 gems 150,000: 2 million gold 300,000: Igawa Asagi (character) Igawa is one of the main protagonists of the series, who, on the Taimanin wiki , is described as having a bust that is “medium-sized to big.” Incredibly funny. It’s not the series’s first gacha game, with two launching previously. Action Taimanin launched in 2019 and is still going, while Taimanin GoGo shut down in January 2024. GoGo was the series’s attempt to go the chibi route, rather than the more traditional route. Another gacha, RPG Extasy, was shuttered last year, also in January. Extasy, as you can imagine, leaned more into what the series is best known for. Taimanin Squad won’t be as lewd Taimanin Squad is going partway in, like Action, and the whole host of other gacha games out there. It’ll be risqué and not something you’ll want to play on the bus, I guess. There’s no release date from Gremory Games, the developer and publisher behind the previous non-lewd gachas, but I’d expect it in early 2026 if the pre-registration is up. It’s also good to bear in mind that these pre-registration pages tend to be a fix, as they’re not live updated. At some point, expect it to leap to that 300,000 mark, regardless of who signs up. Taimanin Squad is set to launch on iOS, Android, and there’s a PC option if you click the “pre-register now” button.

"Sega has killed a third NFT game this year – yes, a third","A Web3, blockchain powered non-fungible token (NFT) game with a Sega license, has been scrapped over “recent changes in the Web3 game market”. Hang on, let me laugh harder. Announced earlier this year, Code of Jokers Evolutions was set to adapt Sega’s now-defunct arcade card game with Web3 malarky that we’ve decided, collectively, to bin. There’s very little of actual gameplay out there, and not even a trailer from what I can see. Despite having no game to play, the developers, Jokers Co. Ltd., had already sold packs and commemorative cards based on another trading card game, Science Ninja Squad Gatchaman, based on a popular anime. As a consolation prize for anyone who bought the packs and isn’t intending to go through the refund process, Jokers is considering converting the cards to be used in their other game. Which, why would you have to consider this? Isn’t that the whole point of NFTs, that it’s a “digital item” and should just be able to be used where it’s been white-flagged? I’m so glad this technology flopped as hard as it did, because even now, I’m shocked at how useless it all is. It seems like Sega is swiftly pulling out of the Web3 market Sega’s Web3 projects have been a failure so far. This year, it also ended the service of KAI: Battle of Three Kingdoms , another trading card game. The game launched this year and ended in October. After a tiny bit of digging, I also found that it had partnered with a developer, Kyuzan Inc., to launch a game in November, Mushinomics with Mushiking . It will conclude its service at the end of the “season.” After January 20, 12 pm Japanese time, the site will not be accessible. Service Termination Notice As scheduled, the game will come to an end with the conclusion of this season. Thank you very much for your continued support. Please note that the game website will no longer be accessible after Jan 20, 2026, at 12:00 (JST). $MUSHI #Oasys — MUSHI (@mushinomics) December 23, 2025 NFTs were the hot thing between 2021 and 2022, with the market eventually crashing as everyone noticed that it was just a mess. It’s only been three or four years since I had to focus on what an NFT was, but it’s already leaked out of my brain. That’s how fast it died. A large part of it is that it was built on clear scams and money laundering. Much like some major art sales around the world, which will see large purchases simply used to get clean cash on the other side of the inevitable sale of the art piece in the future. Do you even remember what an NFT is? The idea behind NFTs was to create a “digital item” that would be owned by you on the blockchain. Essentially, it’d have your info assigned to a bit of data “verifying” that you were the owner. Cool in concept, awful in execution. Remember all those people with the silly ape pictures who were shocked you could steal the image they’d paid for with a right click and press of “save as…”. On top of that, it was yet another contributor to the planet’s demise through pollution. Sega isn’t the only major publisher to ditch Web3 almost entirely Web3 games haven’t had a meaningful success to date. 2025’s bug-filled release , MindsEye, was originally meant to be built as a Web3 game. However, the previous iteration, “Everywhere”, was dumped in favor of rebranding it as MindsEye and user creation suite, Arcadia. Major publishers like Ubisoft have mostly pulled out of the Web3 game, effectively dumping its Ghost Recon NFTs after just a few months. However, it still runs Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, which launched last year. Square Enix threatened at some point to begin launching Web3 stuff, launching Symbiogenesis . That was shuttered in July. As expected, other companies sniffed around. Valve put a block on any Web3 game launching on the Steam platform, while Epic allowed for certain titles. Web3, eh? It’s good that we learnt our lesson about these things, right?

Queue Queen first impressions: Stack ‘em high,"The card roguelike genre has exploded in popularity, and based on the demos currently captivating the community on Steam, it’s showing no sign of slowing down anytime soon. Queue Queen ’s demo is a great example of a fresh spin on the classic roguelike format. If you’ve been wondering whether to pick up the Queue Queen demo or steer clear, you’ll find The Escapist’s first impressions below, looking at everything from the mathematical gameplay loop to the overall quality. The Escapist recaps Queue Queen is an upcoming gambling roguelike, developed and published by Lisisoft. It’s available in demo form on Steam. In Queue Queen , you’re tasked with creating a stack of cards from a full deck, using item cards to modify them and score points. Each round has a target number of points, increasing in difficulty each time. There are boss rounds thrown into the mix to keep things engaging, each presenting a unique challenge, like a modification to the deck or an alteration to the timer. Fans of dice roguelikes and card games will find lots to get excited about with this demo. It’s a fast-paced and engaging style of play, and despite a couple of minor quirks like typos, it feels well-made and charming as a whole. Card-stacking goodness Queue Queen is visually simple, which is refreshing. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/Lisisoft Unlike most card roguelikes, which focus on playing particular hands or trying to score as highly as possible, Queue Queen focuses on stacking cards to hit a target number of points in each round. Cards are pulled from the deck during a round, with the option to stack or skip them. You can’t just stack them infinitely, though – there’s a limit on how many cards you can put in a stack, meaning you need to plan what the optimal stack will look like. This is dictated by the items that you have in your hand. Items in Queue Queen are small cards that apply a certain buff or condition during a round. An item card might award a point for a card being divisible by five, for example, or for a card that features a particular suit. There are boss rounds in Queue Queen. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/Lisisoft Not only do the target scores for each round get higher, but there are also boss rounds to deal with. These bosses pop up in the form of special tarot cards, which are added to your deck alongside the regular cards. Boss round cards can have any number of effects; one might start cutting your round timer, giving you less time to react, while another might scrap some of the cards in your deck, giving you fewer tools to work with. They add a deeper level of strategy to the Queue Queen demo. Fast-paced, strategic gameplay The Hierophant cards cut down the round timer. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/Lisisoft Timing is a big part of Queue Queen , meaning each round went by pretty quickly. You’ll have just over a minute to sort through your deck and stack your cards, meaning bosses like the “Time Marches On” Hierophant round – cutting five seconds off the clock each time a Hierophant is drawn – can be quite tricky. The difficulty curve didn’t feel unfair, though. If you’re a fan of games like Balatro or even Dice of Kalma , it’ll feel familiar, with a slow but steady increase in difficulty permeating through each round, balanced out by a strong variety of item cards in the store. There were plenty of rounds, too, as the Queue Queen demo was fairly generous. The demo offers 32 rounds, and chances are, you won’t get to the very end on your first go. The item cards were unique. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/Lisisoft In terms of quality, Queue Queen ran well and didn’t throw up any major issues. The UI was clean and easy to navigate, and despite its simplicity, the visuals were pleasant and vibrant, making for a fun experience. The only small quality issue picked up on during the demo session was a typo here and there in item card text; this wasn’t a major issue, though, as it didn’t interfere with the enjoyment of the game. If you’ve played through the majority of the gambling roguelikes and card games on Steam already, chances are you’ll fall in love with the Queue Queen demo. It offers a simple yet effective gameplay loop that manages to feel fresh in an admittedly saturated niche, and it has an enjoyable level of difficulty. Ask The Escapist Who made Queue Queen? Queue Queen was developed and published by Lisisoft. What type of game is Queue Queen? Queue Queen is a deck-building gambling roguelike that centers around stacking cards. What are the best card games to play online? The best card games include Balatro , Slay the Spire, and Inscryption. Does Steam have good gambling games? Yes, there are great gambling games on Steam, including Slots and Daggers, CloverPit , and Dog Witch.

Larian CEO Replaced by Elder Brain,"GHENT, Belgium — Larian Studios, the company behind Baldur’s Gate 3 and the Divinity series, announced this week that their CEO Swen Vincke has been replaced with an Elder Brain. “Swen did great work leading the company for many years but the fact is he was quickly becoming obsolete and so I stepped in to replace him,” claimed the Elder Brain in a telepathic press statement. “Now that I’m in charge this place will be able to achieve top efficiency and infinite growth. Under my command, these underlings will do what they’re told, morale will remain high and we will continue to deliver the high quality games that our fans expect. Failure to do so will bring with it severe consequences” While the shake up has lit a fire under some employees, others have had a more negative reaction to the new leadership. “A lot of people won’t admit but morale has been low since the change,” claimed a Larian Dev who wished to remain anonymous. “Elder Brain says that everyone is happy with the way they’re running things but the only ones happy are the ones being mind controlled. Now that they’re in charge, all of a sudden we’re being forced to turn into Mind Flayers. For now they’re just turning the PowerPoint people and the concept artists but it’s only a matter of time before it’s the rest of us. They say we’re okay with it but we’re not. We don’t want to be Mind Flayers, we want to be humans.” Gamers have had mixed reactions to the news. “Big deal if they use Mind Flayers for part of development. It’s only for concept art, so big whoop if a few low level artists are transformed,” wrote Reddit user StepOnMeKarlach. “It’s not like the whole game was made by Mind Flayers, plus the games they make are good so we should just let this slide.” At press time, Elder Brain has defended the use of Mind Flayers in development, stating that sooner or later the whole gaming industry will submit to domination.

"As a Rollerblading Graffiti Artist, I Resent How Easy “Jet Grind Radio” Makes My Job Look","I believe that we are on this planet for a designated purpose, and it is up to each individual to discover what that purpose is. I was lucky enough to be born with a clear understanding of mine, as I cannot think of a time when I didn’t want to be a rollerblading graffiti artist. They say it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert, but honestly, I feel like I’ve dedicated my entire life to my craft. So you can imagine how excited I was when I heard “Jet Grind Radio” was being released for the Sega Dreamcast back in the summer of 2000. Finally, my vocation would be getting the long overdue attention and respect it so profoundly deserved in the digital world. However, when I purchased my game and excitedly popped it into my console on that sunny June afternoon, my elation quickly turned into disgust and embarrassment. How could my life’s work have been conveyed in such a dismissive and reductionist manner? For example, do you have any idea how long it took me to master the soul grind/tagging combo? There’s no way you think it’s easy to spray paint your signature onto the side of a bus stop awning while zipping past on a nearby handrail, yet the game has you performing this onerous task after a quick tutorial with Gum in the very beginning. People earned doctorates in the time it took for me to successfully pull that off, for Christ’s sake. Was it too much for me to expect my field be given the same deference that crazed taxi driving and combative kart racing had? Apparently so. I won’t even get into the more insulting aspects of the game, like the assumption that all rollerblade graffiti artists are members of gangs and operate exclusively on the wrong side of the law. I’ll have you know that I’ve worked with both municipalities and businesses to make public and corporate life more aesthetically pleasing in my town, but try telling that to Sega. I guess a decent and upstanding citizen pulling off sick tricks while improving his community just wouldn’t sell as well, and that’s a goddamn shame. So go ahead and play “Jet Grind Radio” or its even more offensive sequel “Jet Set Radio Future” if you’re so inclined. Just know that these are absolute parodies of a noble, honored profession that takes decades to perfect. In the meantime, I’m going to grab some cans and hit the streets.

Santa Accidentally Schedules Final Fantasy XIV Raid for Christmas Eve,"NORTH POLE — Santa Claus may be late starting his annual delivery run due to accidentally scheduling a Final Fantasy XIV raid on Christmas Eve, sources confirm. “Everyone in my Free Company had availability on a weeknight,” said Santa. “That never happens. I just did not really consider that I had work expectations that night. I play as a healer and we’ve been trying to run The Omega Protocol for months now. I already bailed on a couple sessions earlier this year to watch the World Series. I can’t be ‘that guy’ who gets it moved again. I’ll try and get it done faster then cast Haste on the reindeer to try and make up for lost time.” Santa’s wife says has had plenty of issues with her husband’s gaming getting in the way of his commitments. “I have told him a million times what day Christmas is this year,” said Mrs. Claus. “We have a shared calendar in the kitchen that I have tried to get him to actually look at. If it’s not FFXIV, it’s another game. This oaf of a man didn’t do yard work once this year because he got hooked on Balatro. I have had to shovel all the snow myself and coordinate with the elves in constructing toys because Santa just has to get this current season’s exclusive loot in whatever game he is playing.” Ryan Warburtin is a father of three in Ann Arbor. He says he is frustrated to learn that Santa is running behind but he understands as a fellow gamer his scheduling dilemma. “Jason, Karen and little Polly are going to be upset if Santa does not get the gifts delivered on time,” said Warburtin. “But I get it. It’s hard to schedule gaming sessions with friends as you grow older and have more responsibilities. I’m still trying to figure out a time that works for me and fraternity brothers to play a single round of Helldivers. You take whatever you can get. Maybe Santa can just tweak who is on the naughty list to make faster deliveries. I’m an actuary and I think that if he shifts 20% of good kids to the naughty list he might be able to make up 7% of the lost time of an average FFXIV raid. That little jerk Kyle down the block keeps walking on my grass and maybe Santa forgetting him this year will be the wake up call for him to stop.” At press time, Santa declined to comment on rumors that the raid will be pushed back another couple hours due to a guild member forgetting they had a work holiday party to attend.

My new 6,000 word newsletter telling everyone to review bomb, whoops I mean truth bomb, Rotten Tomatoes, Letterboxd, and IMDb was made with find and replace. My blade is sharpened. I’m ready to make a stand.” Supergirl actress Miley Alcock is prepared, having already looked at Captain Marvel and other female comic book characters that have been criticized by self-proclaimed “die hard fans.” “I’m ready to see photoshopped memes complain that my butt is less juicy than Tom Holland’s Spider-Man,” said Alcock. “I am mentally prepared to see AI generated images of myself that make me look like a virgin’s idea of the ideal sex doll. I am proud of the work I and the rest of the Supergirl team has done bringing this character to life for worldwide audiences. I am trying to avoid the noise of all the commentators saying “nobody asked for this” while making 23 videos about my facial structure. They’ll still buy a ticket just to look at a woman.” Some fans are waiting to see the quality of the memes before deciding to spend their hard-earned cash on a ticket for Supergirl. “I saw Superman in the theater and thought it rocked,” said Matthew Reagan. “ A Supergirl standalone movie? I really don’t know what to think but if I see some X premium accounts post funny memes where Supergirl’s face is edited to be fatter or a comic where she scolds the male heroes and lectures them on women’s rights I might decide to see it on the second weekend instead of opening night.” At press time, Nesbitt has pledged any money he makes from memes he posts to X will go towards finding a cure to the male loneliness epidemic which he claims to be a victim of.

Seymour Guado Awarded Blitzball Peace Prize,"LUCA, Spira — This week, Maester of Yevon and Minister of Temple Affairs Seymour Guado was awarded a special Blitzball Peace Prize by the officials of the Church of Yevon “We are honored to award this peace prize to Seymour Guado,” said Grand Maester of Yevon Yo Mika. “If there’s anyone who deserves this most prestigious honor it’s him. He’s an upstanding gentleman, an excellent Maester and beacon of hope for Spira. He wants nothing but the best for Spira and its people.” While accepting the award, Seymour assured the citizens of Spira of his commitment to bringing peace. “What a great honor it is to finally be recognized for my peace efforts. There’s a lot of corrupt organizations in Spira that have a bias against me. They refuse to acknowledge how great I am at keeping Sin at bay. So I am very thankful to receive this very wonderful Blitzball Peace Prize. Finally, I get the recognition I deserve for being the most peaceful Maester ever. It is my duty to protect all of you from the evils of Sin and I will stop at nothing to make sure Spira is fully at peace. You are all in an endless suffering and I will do whatever it takes to end it. I will literally kill all of you if it means achieving peace. That’s how committed I am.” Some in Spira say the award itself is simply meant to appease Seymour. “It’s a bit of a joke award, ya,” said Blitzball player Wakka. “I mean blitzball is just a sport, what could a blitzball peace prize even be for you know what I’m saying. That Seymour is a bit of an odd one anyway, ya. It’s clear this is just Yevon giving him something to stroke his ego. They want to keep on his good side cause they’re afraid and spineless, ya.” At press time, Seymour was reportedly seen brandishing his prize in front of an uninterested Lady Yuna.

Fallout Fan Has Same Music Taste As Grandpa,"ORANGE COUNTY, Calif. — Local gamer and ‘Fallout’ player Jeffrey O’Toole has found a new way to bond with his grandfather Brian via their shared taste in music, which is exactly alike, confirmed sources. “It’s been great to find something we both love,” O’Toole offered in a statement to the press. “I feel like for most of my life we never really connected very much. But then I started playing games like Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4 , and I got so hooked on their soundtracks. Music was just better back in the 50’s and 60’s, man, I tell ya. When Pop Pop found out that I like to listen to tracks like The Wanderer, I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire, Big Iron , and even Mr. Sandman , well, he just had a big ol’ smile on his face the likes of which I’d never seen before. He started talking to me about where he heard each of them for the first time. It was…really nice. Sorry, I’m uh, just getting a little emotional thinking about it.” When approached for comment, O’Toole’s grandfather Brian had the following to say about his newfound connection with his grandson: “Ya know, for a long time, I just wrote those darn game thingies off. Bunch of malarkey, if you asked me. But when Jeffrey told me they’d been introducing him to some of the greats, like Bobby Darrin and Nat King Cole, I thought to myself ‘I suppose it ain’t all bad.’ Those songs were the soundtrack to some of the best moments of my life: kissing Susie Jenkins in the Oldsmobile after prom, a big ol’ fudge sundae down at the malt shop…boy howdy, listen to me ramblin’ now. Well, anyways, we sat down on the couch at my daughter’s house and Jeffrey showed me these new-fangled things. I must say, I did enjoy the big suit of armor. It was pretty cool.” Jeffrey’s mother Christine expressed both happiness and bewilderment at the new development in the family. “Well, first let me just say, I think it’s amazing that my dad and my boy are finally sitting down and having long conversations. It’s just a joy. I just never thought it would be a video game that would do it. Between you and me, though, I always thought those old jazz and pop songs were kind of lame. I’m a classic rock girl – give me Pink Floyd or Zeppelin any day.” At press time, Jeffrey and Brian were seen laughing together on the couch, genuinely enjoying each other’s company while they watched Walton Goggins gruesomely kill people and forming lifelong memories that will stay with them forever.

Santa Confirms He Will No Longer Be Gifting Xbox Consoles,"NORTH POLE — Immortal elf Santa Claus confirmed that Xbox consoles will no longer be included in his yearly gift distribution event after they disappeared from his website earlier this fall. “I will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles in my magical, bottomless sack,” said Claus. “It’s purely a business decision. I’m just not seeing the demand this year. When only two, three thousand kids put something on their list? It’s not worth my time to train the elves to make it. You’ve got to remember, we handle everything in-house. Production, marketing, distribution—the name of the game up here is efficiency. We can’t carry a weak product.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that he was not concerned by the development. “We still consider the North Pole workshop an important business partner,” said Nadella. “They’ve invested heavily in our AI ventures, and we’re thrilled to provide them with support from Microsoft Copilot. Think about it: Santa has to read billions of lists every year. Imagine the time he could save if he only had to read a short, fairly accurate summary of all of those lists. In fact, according to Copilot, shares in Nvidia are one of the most-requested gifts this year. Don’t miss out! For the love of God, please keep feeding money to the machine!” Market analysts believe this signals a larger shift in how mythical beings will distribute gaming and tech gifts going forward. “For years, we’ve heard rumblings that the traditional console model was unsustainable for these timeless creatures,” said Tim Lithgowe, an independent economics journalist. “As content becomes more widely available across multiple platforms, it makes less and less sense for these demigods to waste warehouse space on stock for a variety of consoles. They’re trying to get lean. Santa’s just-in-time-for-Christmas model in particular can’t accommodate any inventory that isn’t going to move. If a kid wants to play Fortnite, he’ll be just as happy playing it on Switch 2 or PS5.” At press time, a North Pole spokes-elf announced that all remaining Xbox consoles in their inventory will be given to naughty children in place of coal.

Disney Adult Overjoyed by Hidden Mickey Found During Colonoscopy,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Diehard Disney fan Adam Finemann was ecstatic to notice in his colonoscopy results that his bowels contained a hidden Mickey, sources confirmed. “I was looking at the camera stills with my doctor, who was talking about something boring called diverticulitis or whatever, and then boom, I saw it clear as day!” said Finemann, 43, grinning ear to ear. “A near perfect hidden Mickey, right there in my own colon! I could hardly believe my eyes. It was like I was transported right back to Epcot. I could practically taste the turkey legs.” Finemann’s gastroenterologist, Dr. Paula Kochek, admits she wasn’t aware of the symbol’s significance. “Adam scared me half to death when he screamed and started pointing at the computer screen,” said Kocheck. “I thought he saw something clinically significant I was somehow missing. Turns out, he was just very amused by a hyperplastic polyp that looked vaguely like Mickey Mouse ears. I offered to schedule a follow up to remove it, but he insisted he’d rather it ‘stay inside him forever.’ It’s benign of course, so that’s fine, but as his physician now I feel weird.” Adam’s wife Chloe, also a self-proclaimed Disney adult, could hardly contain her spousal pride. “I always knew Adam had real Disney magic in him. I assumed it was figurative and not literal, of course, but clearly he’s even more special than I thought!” she said while picking her husband up from the appointment in their 2017 Toyota Camry with a vanity DSNYCPL license plate. “We’ll celebrate this weekend in Hollywood Studios—I booked us a little getaway, Lightning Lane Passes and all!” The couple later added they intend to have a photo of the “miraculous” hidden Mickey in Adam’s colon turned into a magnet that they can put on their fridge.

"Quentin Tarantino Steps on Lego Piece, Orgasms","LOS ANGELES — In a return to The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast, famed film director, Quentin Tarantino, shared that stepping on Lego blocks with his bare feet can bring him to orgasm. Tarantino shared this latest revelation while breaking down Toy Story 3. “There’s just something about the raw pain oozing from that last five minutes of Toy Story 3,” Tarantino said, holding back tears and cum. “It reminds me of the first time I stepped on a Lego. It was one of those little 2×2 pieces, so it really got into my foot meat. I creamed in agony as I hopped around the room with a pain in my foot and a load in my Hanes.” Sensing this anecdote was starting to get out of hand, podcast host Bret Easton Ellis tried to refocus the conversation on Toy Story 3. Tarantino did not take the bait. “So now I can’t watch the last five minutes of Toy Story 3 without getting incredibly turned on,” Tarantino said, breathing heavily into the mic. “The urge got so bad I went and bought one of those buckets of Lego. You know? The one where you don’t really have anything to build with them, you’re just bullshitting. When I really get in the mood, I dump the bucket on the floor, take off my compression socks, light a candle, and step out into the mess. It’s the most sensational thing I’ve ever felt.” Desperate to move the discussion along. Ellis transitioned to the next movie on Tarantino’s list, Black Hawk Down. “The thing about Black Hawk Down is that it is directed by Ridley Scott,” Tarantino said collecting himself. “And nothing makes me bust like a Ridley Scott film.” At press time, Tarantino checked into a Los Angeles hotel with a grocery bag full of Lego sets, lavender candles, and a DVD copy of Toy Story 3.

Best Valorant crosshair codes to help you play like the pros,"What are the best Valorant crosshairs? Any Valorant player worth their salt will know the first step to mastering the competitive shooter is to fiddle around with their settings and find the best Valorant crosshair for them. While mouse sensitivity, visual settings, and sharp reflexes are all key components to clicking heads, having the perfect crosshair for you is just as important. When you first jump into Riot's FPS game, new Valorant players are given a default crosshair that takes up a fair amount of space in the center of the screen. However, we'd always recommend making your crosshair much smaller than this default option, as it keeps your sightlines as clear as possible. As you'll see from the crosshairs we've highlighted below, virtually every top level player does this. Stick with us as we guide you through many of the best Valorant crosshair codes - you're just a few clicks away from using one of these crosshairs for yourself in your next Valorant ranked match.

Stevivor’s Best Audio 2025,"It's all in the ears... We’re continuing our Stevivor Game of the Year (GOTY) 2025 awards program today with honours for best in-game audio of the year. In this category, “audio” means quite a lot, from a game’s soundtrack right down to the way in which individual sound effects are mixed. With all that in mind, Stevivor staffers have declared that Battlefield 6 was the cream of the crop. Audio is just one of the ways that Battlefield 6 impresses, with Hamish saying that “once you’re stuck in the thick of it,” you’re totally immersed. “Bullets whizz overhead, rockets scream past and blow gaping holes in walls and grenades fall on objectives like volatile raindrops,” Hamish wrote. “It’s pure chaos, and it’s where Battlefield really shines.” Coming in second and third, respectively, were Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur Expedition 33 and id Software’s Doom The Dark Ages . Our Game of the Year 2025 awards program takes a break for Christmas tomorrow, and returns on Boxing Day with Best Narrative of 2025. Catch up on previous awards below.

Stevivor’s Best Indie 2025,"Surprise! We’re full steam ahead with our Stevivor Game of the Year (GOTY) 2025 awards program and using today to honour the best indie game of the year. This category was fun — and maybe a little surprising. While we awarded Clair Obscur Expedition 33 our best RPG of 2025, we aren’t giving it this award. Instead, Stevivor staffers voted in large numbers for Ball x Pit , the brick-breaker darling from Kenny Sun. In a 10/10 review, Steve praised Ball x Pit for its “fun sense of progression, coupled with 10-15 minute gameplay runs (that usually end up with you saying, “just one more!”),” concluding he could “recommend Ball x Pit to just about anyone”. “With a $14.99 USD price tag to boot — and access via Xbox Game Pass if you’re not super-angry with Microsoft right now — this one’s not only a no-brainer, but one of the best games of 2025,” he added. Coming in second and third, respectively, were Supergiant’s Hades 2 and Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur Expedition 33 .

"Co-creator of Call of Duty, Vince Zampella, dies aged 55","Zampella was killed today in a car crash. Call of Duty co-creator Vince Zampella has died in a car crash at the age of 55, The Guardian reports . In addition to Call of Duty , Zampella was also a driving force behind shooter franchises Medal of Honor, Titanfall , and Apex Legends . Most recently, Zampella was promoted to head of Battlefield at EA, and released Battlefield 6 this past October. The Guardian reports that Zampella was involved in a single-car crash yesterday afternoon along California’s Angeles Crest Highway. Two vehicle contained two passengers, both who’ve sadly passed away. In a statement, EA mourned Zampella’s passing. “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,” the statement reads. “Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world,” it continued. “His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.” The post Co-creator of Call of Duty, Vince Zampella, dies aged 55 appeared first on Stevivor .",2025-12-22T22:20:58+00:00,Steve Wright,Stevivor,https://stevivor.com/news/co-creator-of-call-of-duty-vince-zampella-dies-aged-55/
Clair Obscur loses two Indie Game Awards due to AI usage,"More placeholders sneaking into full releases, eh? Clair Obscur Expedition 33 has lost two Indie Game Awards after organisers (eventually) figured out it was released with in-game generative AI assets. The awards’ FAQ stated that games that used generative AI would be “strictly ineligible” for nominations and awards, yet awarded Clair Obscur with both Game of the Year and Best Debut Game. Knowledge of Clair Obscur ‘s generative AI usage has been all over the internet since April of this year . Clair Obscur developer Sandfall said that generative AI was used in development for placeholder textures, but that some of those textures weren’t removed ahead of release. The assets — one of which can be seen above — have since been removed. “In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination,” the (poorly organised?) award organisers said in a statement. “While the assets in question were patched out and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place.” The changes mean that Blue Prince is The Indie Game Awards’ Game of the Year, and Sorry We’re Closed is Best Debut Game.

Battlefield 6 accused of using AI for cosmetic sticker,"Another genAI strikes again... Battlefield 6 is the latest game to be accused of using AI-generated art, this time in the form of a winter-themed cosmetic sticker. User Willcario took to Reddit over the weekend with a post titled, “Remove this AI shit from the store,” in which they showcased a new player card sticker titled “Winter Warning”. “Two barrels on the M4A1, sure,” they wrote. “I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them.” Another user, DEMIG0DX, “fixed” the sticker using AI themself , removing the erroneous second barrel from the weapon. “Lmao, I can spend 5 minutes in an AI image generator and get that perfect,” AssassinsCreedFan wrote, prompting their fellow user to attempt the fix. “So what’s funny about this is that ALL of them are AI generated, but this is all you people are talking about because they didn’t bother checking and correcting the AI image generator.” Neither EA or Battlefield Studios have commented on this specific sticker, but they have talked about AI usage in the past. First, EA head said that AI was at “the very core of our business” back in its September Investor Day. Next, Battlefield Studios’ Rebecka Coutaz told the BBC back in October that generative AI was “very seducing,” but that the studio didn’t have a way to insert it into its work. Battlefield 6 is available on Windows PC, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5.

Stevivor’s Best Ongoing 2025,"These games keep going, and going, and going... We’re kicking off the second week of our Stevivor Game of the Year (GOTY) 2025 awards program by honouring the best ongoing game of the year. This category is one with titans of gaming — titles that not only have stood the test of time in our consoles and PCs, but in our hearts. That’s possible through appropriate content releases, and community engagement. This year, Stevivor staffers decided that Microsoft’s Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 was the best ongoing game of 2025. That’s fairly big, as Flight Sim 2024 launched last year in a less than ideal state . A series of bug fixes has corrected that, as has a new release on PS5 . Coming in second and third, respectively, were Team Asobi’s Astro Bot and IO Interactive’s little assassin that could, Hitman World of Assassination .

Stevivor’s Best Multiplayer 2025,"Grab a friend and get playing. The first week of the Stevivor Game of the Year (GOTY) 2025 awards program comes to a close with a focus on the best multiplayer game of this year. Stevivor staffers threw a number of votes in a bunch of directions, ultimately awarding this year’s honour to none other than Battlefield 6 . Hamish may (or may not — we’re not actually telling you) have been one staff writer that didn’t throw votes Battlefield 6 ‘s way. In his 7.5/10 review , he said,” Battlefield 6 does enough, but… fails to retake the top step through its own power; it’s not as forgettable as other recent entries in the series, but it could have been so much more.” Coming in second and third, respectively, were Nintendo’s Mario Kart World and The Coalition’s Gears of War Reloaded .

Naughty Dog devs reportedly under mandatory crunch for Intergalactic The Heretic Prophet,"Say it ain't so! Sony studio Naughty Dog is reportedly forcing its employees to work a minimum of eight hours overtime a week on the upcoming Intergalactic The Heretic Prophet , according to Bloomberg . The outlet states that, since late October, employees have been required to work a minimum of eight hours of overtime per week, though total hours per week cannot exceed a maximum of 60 hours. Overtime is to be logged by an internal spreadsheet. Moreover, a previous requirement of three days worked in the office per week has been changed to days days per week, Bloomberg reports. The report states that this crunch has been placed upon Naughty Dog as developers have missed multiple deadlines on internal demos for Sony. Mandatory overtime is slated to end this week, days before Christmas; the requirement of working in the office three days per week has been reinstated from then until the end of January 2026. Intergalactic The Heretic Prophet is planned for release on PS5, though does not have a release date at present.

"Exodus dev studio head steps down, one week after Game Awards trailer","Whelp? Archetype studio head James Ohlen has stepped down from his role just one week after Exodus debuted a new trailer at The Game Awards. “At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,” Hasbro’s Abby Hodes told Bloomberg , which made the initial report. According to Hasbro, Ohlen “asked to shift his creative focus” towards tabletop games; he will function as a creative consultant for Hasbro. Ohlen is a Bioware veteran, who’s worked on Anthem and Baldur’s Gate . He joined Wizards of the Coast back in 2019; his team announced the Mass Effect- like Exodus back at The Game Awards 2023. A new trailer for the title was shown last week , giving us a better glimpse of Hollywood’s Matthew McConaughey as protagonist Jun. Bloomberg also states that Hasbro, owner of Wizards of the Coast, has brought in Paul Della Bitta to head up its digital ventures division. Della Bitta is a former Blizzard dev who has also spent two years at Riot Games and, most recently, as a co-founder of Dreamhaven alongside former Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime.

Stevivor’s Best Action-Adventure 2025,"Despite a packed field, one clear victor emerged... Our Stevivor Game of the Year (GOTY) 2025 awards program continues with honours for the best action-adventure games of the year. This is by far our biggest category in terms of sheer nominations, with Stevivor staffers throwing a host of votes all throughout the field. In the end though, one game emerged as our hands-down favourite: MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle . “The complete package… is epic,” Ben wrote in our 9/10 review earlier this year . “It’s inspired me to rewatch the entire franchise — which only further endears the Great Circle — and kept me on the edge of my seat, glued to the expertly weaved story-into-gameplay structure,” Ben continued. “It’s a great adaptation by building gameplay into an elongated narrative that stays true to the character. The Great Circle is strictly for the fans, in all the right ways.” Coming in second and third, respectively, were Supergiant’s Hades 2 and 11 Bit Studios’ The Alters .

Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian has confirmed it’s using generative AI in the development of its upcoming title, Divinity , but none of that AI-produced content will ultimately appear in-game. Speaking with Bloomberg , Vincke said that, “at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it.” According to the CEO, generative AI will be used to brainstorm, create PowerPoint presentations, and develop both concept art and placeholder text. He stressed that none of that AI-generated content will make it into Divinity. “Everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves,” he told the outlet. “I think a lot of founders have the same problem,” Vincke continued. “I have to be large, otherwise I can’t make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn’t necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn’t imagine existed.” Update: Vincke has responded to backlash that has been generated in response to his interview, telling IGN , “we are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. “We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.” Divinity was announced last week at The Game Awards .

Dambuster teased the sequel in September of this year, saying, “the next outbreak is already brewing”. “It’s been 14 years since Dead Island first splattered onto the scene, stranding players in the blood-soaked paradise of Banoi,” Dambuster’s message continued. “Since then, the zompocalypse has crawled from tropical shores to the sun-drenched chaos of HELL-A in Dead Island 2, where over 20 million Slayers have left nothing but carnage behind. “This isn’t the final cut though.

"Tomb Raider has a unified timeline, new Lara Croft voice actor","It's all coming together. Tomb Raider has been going strong since 1996, with myriad games and voice actors behind it. Current steward Crystal Dynamics has recently spoken to how it will unify the franchise’s different iterations into a single timeline, and who will be voicing the current version of protagonist Lara Croft. A unified Tomb Raider timeline Speaking with GamesRadar , Crystal Dynamics’ Will Kerslake detailed where both new Tomb Raider games — Legacy of Atlantis and Catalyst — fit into the larger timeline. “From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider Underworld ,” Kerslake said. “With the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we’re seeing a more experienced Lara Croft.” So that means that Crystal Dynamics latest ‘survivor’ trilogy — Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider , and Shadow of the Raider — canonically come first in the overall timeline. The 1996 original Tomb Raider , Tomb Raider Anniversary , and the new Legacy of Atlantis come next — all roughly in the same position — followed by a host of sequels. Finally, Catalyst comes at the end of the timeline, behind Tomb Raider Underworld . “Same character; two different time periods in her life,” Kerslake summarised as part of a Q&A following last week’s Game Awards. Alix Wilton Regan takes over as Lara Croft The two new Tomb Raider games will feature a new voice actor as Lara Croft: Alix Wilton Regan. Regan, who replaces Camilla Luddington as Croft, is no stranger to video games. Previously, she’s voiced characters including Specialist Samantha Traynor in Mass Effect 3 , the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age Inquisition , Aya in Assassin’s Creed Origins , and more. “[Regan] was already a fan when we met her,” said Crystal Dynamics’ Scot Amos in The Game Awards Q&A. “And then being able to talk to her, and [gaining] a sense that she has that wit and that charm and charisma that is a natural essence and core for Lara, but she also has that confidence and that depth of emotionality that we need for telling these great stories.” Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis comes first in 2026; Tomb Raider Catalyst is expected in 2027.

Dead by Daylight Halloween to be delisted in January 2026,"Want to play as Michael Myers? Better buy it soon... Dead by Daylight ‘s Halloween chapter will be removed for sale from 19 January 2026, Behaviour Interactive has recently confirmed. Players will have the chance to pay and unlock Laurie Strode and The Shape (Michael Myers) up until 11.00 am ET on 19 January 2026. Any combination of Halloween content — the full pack or individual characters — will be playable beyond that purchase deadline, provided you pulled the trigger. Halloween ‘s Haddonfield map will be pulled from rotation as of 19 January, so those of you who haven’t picked up the House of Pain Achievement or Trophy — unlocked by repairing the generators in the Myers home — should make that priority in the next few weeks. Character Perks will remain available for the characters, provided players have unlocked the characters ahead of Behaviour’s deadline. If not, the perks will be added to the general character pool under new names. “As with all Live Service games, frequent updates and additions are to be expected,” Behaviour Interactive said . “With The Shape and Laurie Strode our focus continues to be ensuring that both characters legacy remains within our games for fans who have unlocked them or plan to do so before 19th January 2026.” The delisting of certain pieces of DLC is nothing new to Dead by Daylight — the game’s Hellraiser DLC was removed in April of this year .

Expect Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic sometime before 2030,"I hope the Jedi Order still teaches patience... Going off Stevivor’s stats during The Game Awards, Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic gripped most viewers’ attention . It’s somewhat of a shame, then, that the game isn’t coming out any time soon. Taking to Twitter, Arcanaut Studios head Casey Hudson said that Fate of the Old Republic would only confirm that the RPG would be released sometime before 2030. “Don’t worry about the ‘not till 2030’ rumors,” Hudson said . “Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!” Hudson’s post followed a musing by game journalist Jason Schreier , who said, “Lucasfilm says [Arcanaut] was founded this year, which means that 2030 is an *optimistic* guess. Maybe it’ll be a PlayStation 7 game.” Hudson’s last studio, Humanoid Origin, closed up shop about a year ago, with Hudson’s own LinkedIn saying he started his current role as founder and CEO of Arcanaut as recently as July 2025.

I pressed both him and Thomas Puha, Remedy’s director of communications, on that point. “It is a new threat,” Kasurinen reiterated with Stevivor. “I want to be clear on that. There is a new antagonist here.” “Yeah, I think [in] the original game — I’m not saying we failed, but establishing the threat, properly, was definitely the thing we wanted to tackle here,” added Puha. Whelp… “The Hiss ended up — maybe felt almost — like you were fighting a disease,” Kasurinen concluded. “So, we want to add more elements of personality this time around. “More will be revealed,” said Kasurinen. Rest assured, we’re as invested in Remedy’s universe as you all, so we’ll keep pressing them and will have more information as it becomes available. Until then, what do you make of Resonant’ s reveal announcement? Control Resonant is planned for a 2026 release on Windows PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Mac via Steam and the Apple App Store, and consoles including Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5. Stevivor attended a remote, hands-off preview of Control Resonant over Discord, as invited by the publisher.

Control Resonant Preview: Dylan takes Manhattan,"""The sibling has gone rogue/fishing."" Control 2 is actually Control Resonant , a sequel to Remedy’s incredibly popular shooter (and our very own GOTY 2019 ) set outside the Oldest House seven years after the events of the original. Ahead of today’s reveal at The Game Awards, Stevivor was able to sit down with Remedy and attend a remote, hands-off showing that detailed Dylan Faden’s new adventure. “ Control Resonant takes place seven years after the first Control game,” Mikael Kasurinen, the creative director of Control Resonant and the co-creative director of Remedy, told us. “Jesse mysteriously disappears, and the lockdown [of the Oldest House] falls apart. All the paranatural forces fill onto the streets of Manhattan. On top of that, a new threat is reshaping our reality and creating new, devastating monsters. “Dylan wakes up, and this is where the second game starts,” Kasurinen continued. “He’s the only one who can fight back and help contain the disaster.” Dylan and his Aberrant. Dylan, of course, was a main focal point of the original Control — Prime Candidate 6, or P6, to the P7 of his sister and protagonist Jesse Faden. Following an Altered World Event in the town of Ordinary, Maine, Dylan was apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Control, where he remained until Jesse entered the Oldest House and discovered him seventeen years later. A further seven years later, in 2026, Dylan is finally free. “He has lived his whole life inside the Oldest House,” Kasurinen said. “To Dylan, the door leading to the streets of Manhattan might as well be a portal into an alien dimension. This is a discovery of a new reality just like what the Oldest House was to Jesse.” As such, Control and Control Resonant are remarkably different from each other, with each title representing, “one of the siblings and their respective journeys through this world,” according to Kasurinen. I don’t remember this in Manhattan… “You can play both of these games in any order,” Kasurinen asserted. “They stand on their own feet, like two independent siblings. This was always the story of two siblings who [try] to reconnect.” While Jesse fought back against The Hiss using her own parautilitarian abilities coupled with a ranged pistol in her Service Weapon, Dylan will use his natural abilities alongside a melee-focused sledgehammer called the Aberrant. “The Aberrant [is a] shapeshifting weapon that changes on the fly in the different forms,” Kasurinen said of Dylan’s companion. “There are several forms for the players to discover. “Aesthetically, the weapon is raw, crude, and to the point. Function over form; only results matter. It allows you on to pull off superhuman feats, especially when combined with [Dylan’s] powerful abilities.” Dylan’s great and all… but where’s Jesse? Just as Dylan’s sledgehammer is anything but a normal one, so too is Resonant’ s setting of Manhattan. The mega-city is closed off by an “otherworldly barrier,” according to Kasurinen, and will function as a, “larger, more open-ended world,” as compared to a straight up open world. It’ll also look and function like the ever-changing Oldest House rather than a regular ol’ city, Kasurinen assured us. Kasurinen continued to say that Resonant’s Manhattan is, “a world filled with secrets, activities, and stories — none of them filler, but carefully designed and integrated into the larger open-ended world. “A big goal was transitioning the game from action-adventure to action-RPG,” he continued. “We define this as having player-driven, open-ended exploration, more meaningful progression, and real choices. Players can create distinctive builds, complementing their gameplay style. We want to encourage boldness, exploration, and experimentation.” It’s not just in regard to the setting — opened-ended world rather than open world — in which Remedy is very careful with its words. Though Resonant’ s trailer shows Dylan fighting the Hiss, Kasurinen was careful to repeatedly call what Dylan will face in Manhattan “a new threat”. Picking up on that, I asked him to elaborate. “More will be revealed, but it is a new threat,” Kasurinen told Stevivor. “I want to be clear on that. There is a new antagonist here. “The Hiss ended up — maybe felt almost — like you were fighting a disease. So, we want to add more elements of personality this time around.” Control Resonant is planned for a 2026 release on Windows PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Mac via Steam and the Apple App Store, and consoles including Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5.

Control Resonant is a game sequel and not a TV show (though is partially funded by Annapurna),"Control Resonant was today announced by Remedy at The Game Awards, and has been confirmed by the studio as a sequel to 2019’s Control rather than a television or film endeavour. “Players will explore a warped Manhattan on the brink of paranatural annihilation in this thrilling action-adventure RPG,” Remedy said of the newly announced title. “Unleash the extraordinary powers of Dylan Faden as he fights for his humanity and survival against a reality-bending cosmic threat.” Those with keen eyes will note an Annapurna logo on the game’s reveal trailer, below, though Remedy was quick to point out that Resonant, “will be published by Remedy Entertainment,” and that, “Annapurna Pictures are co-financing and co-producing the game as part of a strategic partnership with Remedy Entertainment.” “After years in confinement at the hands of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), Dylan Faden’s former captors are deploying him at the peak of a supernatural crisis. Charged with combating a mysterious cosmic entity as it alters fundamental aspects of our reality, Dylan must harness his new found powers to take the fight to the myriad threats overwhelming Manhattan.,” Remedy continued. “On the path to unlocking the full potential of his supernatural abilities Dylan will also seek out his sister, FBC Director Jesse Faden, as he struggles to comprehend and contain the dangers that have spilled beyond the confines of the Oldest House to tear the world apart,” said Remedy. “ Control Resonant pushes our paranatural action RPG series into an expansive, reality-warping playground of choice, power, and consequence,” said Mikael Kasurinen, the game’s creative director. “You don’t have to know the first game to jump into the sequel, we’ve made this one easy to pick up and hard to put down. “We’re pushing the scale beyond anything we’ve done before, elevating combat, exploration, and storytelling into a bigger, more memorable experience,” Kasurinen continued. “It’s ambitious, a little wild, and we can’t wait for players to get lost in it.” Control Resonant is planned for a 2026 release on Windows PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Mac via Steam and the Apple App Store, and consoles including Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5.

"Leon playable in Resident Evil Requiem, features in new trailer","""Fake news,"" eh Capcom? Update: Surprising absolutely no one, Leon has today been confirmed in Resident Evil Requiem . You can check him out in action via the new Game Awards 2025 trailer, below. “Resident Evil Requiem is now available for pre-order,” Capcom said alongside the new trailer. “Experience terrifying survival horror with FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, and dive into pulse-pounding action with legendary agent Leon S. Kennedy. Both of their journeys and unique gameplay styles intertwine into a heart-stopping, emotional experience that will chill you to your core.” Original story: Resident Evil Requiem will feature RE2, RE4, and RE6 protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, its PS5 cover art has today confirmed. Twitter user SpookyHoo first noticed the game’s updated cover art , taking to Twitter and showing off Leon’s pretty face via his pre-downloads screen. Since then, others — including this outlet, have confirmed the image is real. In it, you can see Leon’s large looming face positioned behind the back of fellow protagonist Grace Ashcroft. You can see a portion of that cover art above. Earlier this week, a GameStop listing stated that Resident Evil Village ‘s Rose Winters would appear in-game ; previously, Leon’s name appeared alongside a listing of in-game bonus items. Could Rose be a placeholder for Leon in this new instance, or will we have three protagonists inside Requiem ? Time will tell… and we’ll most likely find out during this week’s Game Awards on Thursday night, Los Angeles-time. Last month, Capcom’s Masato Kumazawa called one very specific “leak” of Leon appearing in Requiem as “fake news”. “Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong,” Kumazawa told us . “It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation. “There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eye patch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news,” Kumazawa told us. Expect Resident Evil Requiem from 27 February 2026 on Windows PC, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, PS5, and Switch 2.

Another Xbox console exclusive is no more, with South of Midnight heading to PS5 and Switch 2 in 2026. “Every creature holds a secret in the mythical Deep South – South of Midnight launches on PlayStation 5 in Spring 2026,” developer Compulsion Games said on Twitter ahead of an announcement as South of Midnight won The Game Awards’ Games for Impact category.

That weird The Game Awards 2025 statue teased Larian’s Divinity,"Whoever said it was Diablo? Update: As it turns out, that statue was promoting Larian’s Divinity . You can check out the game’s first teaser trailer below. “While Divinity is a brand new game that doesn’t require experience with previous Larian titles, those who’ve played Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be able to enjoy greater understanding and continuity,” Larian said of its upcoming title. “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled ‘ Divinity’,” said Swen Vincke, founder and game director of Larian Studios. “We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the Divinity we’ve always wanted to make and you’re going to have loads of fun with it.” Original story: Geoff Keighley has taken to social media to tease a real-life monolith in the Mojave Desert, and some believe it’s to tease a new Diablo 4 expansion that will be announced during The Game Awards 2025. Keighley took to Twitter with an image of a monolith covered in a host of skeletons, alongside the caption “regal.inspiring.thickness”. That corresponds to a specific point on the earth, using the what3words geocode service . Those close to the Mojave Desert location have provided photos of the real-life monolith, both in the daytime and at night. Needless to say, the monolith is far more impressive in the dark . Windows Central’s Jez Corden has also taken to social media , reporting that the tease is connected to a 2026 Diablo 4 expansion that will also bring a new ranking system and leaderboards. Whether Corden is right or wrong will be revealed at The Game Awards, we’ll find out soon enough. The Game Awards 2025 livestreams from 12.00 pm AEDT on 12 December here in Australia. Update: Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has taken to ResetEra to state that the tease isn’t related to Diablo 4 after all. “No idea where Jez is getting that, but this statue is not teasing the Diablo 4 expansion,” Schreier wrote, adding, “I don’t currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it’s a good one.” Once again, we’ll find out at The Game Awards next week.
