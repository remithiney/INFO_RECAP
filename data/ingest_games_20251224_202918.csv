Fallout's Latest Episode Snuck In An Incredible Fallout: New Vegas Meme,"Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead. Another week, another episode of Fallout. This week saw lots of use of Lucy’s (Ella Purnell) “Golden Rule” and a look into the politics of the Brotherhood of Steel. In many ways this episode felt like a significant step forward for the series, but it also took its time to honor Fallout’s past. From iconic locations to lore deep cuts , there was no shortage of callbacks. Let's take a look at what “The Golden Rule” had to offer.

"Fallout Season 2, Episode 2 Summary: War (And Radscoprions) Never Change","Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead. While last week focused on Lucy (Ella Purnell), Cooper Howard aka The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and their pursuit of Hank (Kyle Maclachlan), this week we caught up with the newly knighted Maximus (Aaron Moten) and his chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline. The episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast.

AI VTuber Neuro-Sama Just Obliterated Her Own Massive Twitch World Record,"In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the Vedal987 Twitch channel within a limited time. Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a Minecraft Hardcore run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can ""see"" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model. Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.

"I Hated Parrying, Until I Played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33","Parrying is about subtlety. It's the act of scrutinizing fisticuffs and sword fights with a furrowed brow, familiarizing yourself with the cadence of combat right down to milliseconds, and learning the precise moment of performing a counter attack. For instance, a small variation in animation may point to a rare opening. A slight note change in the audio cue may indicate a shift of attacks from the enemy. To parry well is to understand these details and adapt to them dexterously. That said, doing so is exhausting. The requirements needed to pull off a parry in most games can be steep and exacting. It's why I'd usually avoid parrying if there are other ways to minimize damage during combat, such as blocking or dodging. The painterly Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, one of my favorite RPGs this year, has been the exception. Within its dazzling combat system I've discovered the joy of parrying, every encounter an exhilarating sequence of silky-smooth attacks and ripostes. Fighting in Expedition 33 is a resplendent affair, thanks to its surprisingly in-depth and complex structure. Its skirmishes enhance JRPG-inspired turn-based combat with real-time elements that get players to dodge--and parry--at the right moment.

"‘Breaking Bad’ star Aaron Paul got absolutely destroyed by this role, but he may be thinking about reprising it soon","Aaron Paul, the star best known for Breaking Bad , is far more likely to sign on for a potential Dispatch Season 2, but it took the game’s massive success to convince him, as per Eurogamer . That’s fantastic news because the creators of the game were genuinely worried he wouldn’t ever work with them again after the grueling process of making the first season. Game director Nick Herman admitted that if Paul had known the true scope of the project, he probably wouldn’t have agreed to do it in the first place. Narrative director Pierre Shorette definitely agreed with that sentiment, stating Paul “would have said no for sure.” Paul plays the central character, Robert, in the game, meaning his acting commitment wasn’t light. He features throughout the entire story, and Shorette described the effort required as “grueling.” They had to keep bringing Paul back for recording sessions over two full years because he features in basically “the entire f***ing game.” Certain fan interactions in Paris might have played a role in convincing Aaron Paul for another rodeo Shorette likened the process to “water torture, a drip here and there.” He explained that they would call Paul after eight weeks of silence, asking for another four-hour session. Shorette recalled Paul saying, “F***, I thought I was done with this.” I can only imagine that frustration; two years of sporadic calls for a single role sounds like a total headache, even if you love the script. Thankfully, Paul did respond positively to the material initially. Shorette noted that they had a great casting director who had a relationship with Paul, and the actor was “feeling it.” Paul had previously worked on the dark animated comedy Bojack Horseman , which shares some tonal DNA with Dispatch . Shorette said, “Thank god too, because I don’t know what this is without him at this point.” Dispatch devs admitted they thought Aaron Paul would never work with them again after voice recording stretched over more than two years. “It was gruelling… like water torture — a drip here and there,” the team said. pic.twitter.com/ONbbwDLJb9 — Gaming.Bo3.gg (@Gaming_bo3gg) December 24, 2025 What really changed Paul’s mind about the project and cemented his interest in future seasons was the massive fan response. Paul has actually moved to France, and Shorette mentioned that Paul was approached by fans on the streets of Paris who recognized him specifically from the game. Herman pointed out that this is huge because Paul has been in the public eye for so long, and usually, people approach him only to shout references about Breaking Bad . Herman emphasized that for someone to walk up and say, “Hey, this video game that is coming out right now: I love you in it,” just doesn’t happen for the actor. Fans were hitting him up while the game was still coming out episodically, saying, “Hey, love you in Dispatch .” Paul was reportedly shocked that the game had reached France and that it “kind of popped off,” much like Black Myth Wukong, which created a massive boom in tourism for China’s Shanxi province . It’s worth remembering that it’s just Paul’s very recognizable voice acting in the game, not a motion-captured digital likeness. Shorette said that the fan recognition was the moment “it clicked for him, like, oh this is real.” He realized the game had become a definite success that reached far beyond the typical gaming audience. Because of that commercial and critical success, Herman laughingly admitted that the game “kind of needed to do what it did for him to be interested in doing it again.” If you loved Paul’s performance as Robert, you can definitely expect to see him return if AdHoc moves forward with Dispatch Season 2, which seems incredibly likely. For the time being, you can watch Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul episodes in order .",2025-12-24T20:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/gaming/breaking-bad-star-aaron-paul-got-absolutely-destroyed-by-this-role-but-he-may-be-thinking-about-reprising-it-soon/,en,0.9422805905342102
"The reason the FCC banned this tech is chilling, and now the Nebraska AG is ripping apart the company that sold it to you anyway","Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has filed a major lawsuit against smart home company Resideo, claiming the company sold consumers insecure cameras while actively hiding their true origins, as per Tom’s Hardware . This is a big deal, especially since Resideo is a massive Honeywell spin-off with a market capitalization over $5 billion. The security risks associated with some home cameras, particularly those from more affordable brands, are becoming a known issue in the industry. The core of Hilgers’ complaint is that Resideo failed to properly tell you that the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for its cameras were Hikvision and Dahua. If those names ring a bell, they should. The U.S. government has been seriously concerned about these two Chinese companies for years. The reason for the concern is chilling. The FCC officially banned equipment from both Hikvision and Dahua back in November 2022 because of threats to national security. The lawsuit claims that Resideo sold these cameras under its own Capture brand at least from 2021 to 2022, obscuring their origin from unsuspecting buyers. It’s truly awful when you realize the camera meant to protect your family might actually be leaking video to third parties Hilgers’ lawsuit, filed in Nebraska state court, alleges that Resideo violated both the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act and the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Art. Essentially, the company is accused of selling gear known to be insecure to people who didn’t suspect a thing. That’s a huge problem for consumers who thought they were buying a secure, reliable product. It gets worse, too. Even outside of governmental concerns, security professionals have been scrutinizing equipment from both Hikvision and Dahua for almost ten years now. They weren’t just finding plain old security holes; they were finding intentional backdoors designed for remote access. This isn’t just a matter of poor software updates; this is fundamental design that puts your private data at risk. And there has been a massive data breach from private cameras , so this isn’t even a theoretical threat. ICYMI: Nebraska AG Mike Hilgers sued tech company Resideo, alleging “deceptive and unfair business practices"" involving Chinese-made cameras. From @4nsmiley and @NE_Examiner : https://t.co/vonJA19VV5 — Aaron Sanderford (@asanderford) December 24, 2025 This lawsuit against Resideo joins an ever-growing list of legal actions targeting sellers of Chinese smart devices. Just this past September, AG Hilgers filed a similar lawsuit against Lorex, another camera manufacturer whose gear you can find in major retailers like Costco and Best Buy. Lorex was reportedly marketing its cameras as “private by design,” while conveniently forgetting to mention that their OEMs were also sanctioned by the U.S. for similar security reasons. Other states are getting busy, too. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is currently suing heavy hitters like Sony, LG, Samsung, TCL, and HiSense over how they collect data, specifically citing automated TV screenshot collection. And down in Arizona, AG Kris Mayes filed a lawsuit against Temu, focusing on data collection, privacy, and counterfeiting concerns. We also just saw the FCC officially ban DJI drones, which is another huge step in limiting the use of certain Chinese technology in the U.S. Given how prevalent Chinese OEMs are inside common household electronics today, you can bet this tale is only just getting started. This is a serious warning sign that you need to be extremely careful about what brands you trust to secure your smart home.",2025-12-24T19:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/the-reason-the-fcc-banned-this-tech-is-chilling-and-now-the-nebraska-ag-is-ripping-apart-the-company-that-sold-it-to-you-anyway/,en,0.9603806138038635
"After years of requests, HBO Max finally adds a feature fans have been begging for since 2020","HBO Max has finally given DC fans what they wanted after five years of waiting. The streaming service launched a 24/7 live channel dedicated to DC Comics content. Fans have been asking for this feature since the platform started in 2020. According to The Direct , Warner Bros. Discovery announced the new channel in a recent press release. The DC channel is now live on HBO Max alongside other 24/7 channels for The Big Bang Theory , Friends , and Harry Potter . The channel will play DC content around the clock, giving fans a constant stream of superhero shows and movies. HBO Max has become the main home for DC Comics content over the years. This became even more clear in 2024 when James Gunn’s new DC Universe arrived on the platform. Now, the service is taking another step to highlight its superhero library. The new channel gives fans easy access to decades of DC content The DC channel can pull from over 50 years of movies and TV shows. Warner Bros. did not share a specific list of what will air, but the channel will likely include recent DC Studios releases like Superman and Peacemaker . It could also feature classic films like Tim Burton’s Batman movies. The channel will probably show various DC TV series from throughout the brand’s history. Animated content will likely play a big role too, since DC has made quality animated shows and movies for decades. Fans can now tune in at any time and find something DC-related playing. The streaming world has seen similar celebrity moments recently, like when a former Nickelodeon star was spotted in an unexpected situation. HBO Max has released their 2026 hype reel. It includes the first look at DC Studios' 'LANTERNS'! pic.twitter.com/NyXk4apepi — DCU Brief (@DCUBrief) December 12, 2025 This move follows what other streaming services have already done. Disney+ introduced similar live channels a few years ago for properties like Star Wars and Marvel. These channels come and go on Disney’s platform, sometimes staying for just a few weeks. HBO Max could set itself apart by keeping its channels permanent. If the DC channel stays active for months or years, fans will always know where to find it. The service could add more channels over time instead of removing them. Entertainment moments that feel unplanned often become the most memorable, much like Breaking Bad’s only unscripted scene that became iconic. These live channels recreate the cable TV experience on streaming platforms. While streaming is built on choosing what to watch whenever you want, some viewers still enjoy having content served to them. The DC channel lets fans watch superhero content without deciding on a specific title first.",2025-12-24T18:15:00+00:00,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/movies-tv/after-years-of-requests-hbo-max-finally-adds-a-feature-fans-have-been-begging-for-since-2020/,en,0.9585875868797302
"Fans have believed one thing about ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ for five years, now the creative director just set the record straight","A top creative director at CD Projekt Red just ended a long-running debate about Cyberpunk 2077. Igor Sarzyński cleared up a popular fan theory that has been around since before the game even launched. The theory was about the elevators in the game, and fans have been discussing it for years. Sarzyński has been with CD Projekt Red since 2011. He started as a QA tester and slowly moved up over the years. He became a cinematic designer, then a senior cinematic designer, and later a cinematic lead. In 2020, he became a cinematic director, and by January 2024, he was promoted to creative director. He directed the story for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and will help lead the next Cyberpunk game. According to Game Rant , Sarzyński posted a message on Bluesky to address the elevator theory. He explained that the elevators in Cyberpunk 2077 are not hidden loading screens, which is what many fans believed for years. This theory first appeared in September 2020 when a Reddit user suggested that elevator rides would take longer on HDD drives than SSD drives because they might be covering up loading times. The elevators exist simply because they make sense in Night City Even though CD Projekt Red developers tried to shut down this theory before, it kept coming back online. Sarzyński made it clear that elevators appear in Night City just because it makes sense for a big city to have them. He added that the game’s engine could even make the elevators see-through if they wanted. He defended the REDengine by calling it a miracle and said he would not accept any criticism of it. One user on Bluesky responded by asking why CD Projekt Red switched to Unreal Engine 5 if their own engine was so good. The studio is moving to Unreal Engine 5 for future projects like The Witcher 4 and the next Cyberpunk game. CD Projekt Red dev shuts down Cyberpunk 2077 theory that elevators in-game help hide loading times “You really think you can traverse a whole city and enter a huge complex interior with no loading screens, but we need to do elevator tricks to load a penthouse?” pic.twitter.com/3eJnShB31V — Dexerto (@Dexerto) December 23, 2025 Sarzyński replied that the studio wants to focus on making games instead of building engines. Players who want to experience what the REDengine can do can see its full potential in the current game. This matches what other CD Projekt Red leaders have said before. Charles Tremblay, the vice president of technology, explained in November 2024 that switching to Unreal Engine 5 would help the studio manage multiple projects at the same time more easily. For those exploring Night City, the game offers dozens of missions to complete throughout the story. CD Projekt Red currently has seven games in the works. Five of them are Witcher games, including The Witcher 4 , which was shown at The Game Awards 2024. The studio plans to release three new Witcher games within six years. They also have a Witcher remake being made by Fool’s Theory and a Witcher spinoff called Project Sirius in development. The studio has not announced release dates for any of these games yet. This includes the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel and a completely new game based on an original idea.",2025-12-24T18:00:00+00:00,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/games/fans-have-believed-one-thing-about-cyberpunk-2077-for-five-years-now-the-creative-director-just-set-the-record-straight/,en,0.8901233673095703
"‘It was so, so good’: Hideo Kojima reveals the Netflix movie that made him cry, and he’s not embarrassed about it","Hideo Kojima, the famous game designer who creates dark post-apocalyptic worlds, just shared that he completely broke down while watching the Netflix animated movie KPop Demon Hunters . The 62-year-old creator is best known for the Death Stranding games, where players deliver packages through empty wastelands filled with ghost-like zombie creatures called Beached Things. His games deal with heavy and intense themes, but it turns out he has a soft side. According to Variety , Kojima posted on X this week about his emotional reaction to the film. He said he casually started watching KPop Demon Hunters, got completely hooked, and ended up crying his eyes out by the end. He later wrote a short but powerful review, saying “It was so, so good” with emotional emojis. This is a big reaction from one of gaming’s most respected creators. The storyline was not the only thing that moved him. Kojima became obsessed with the soundtrack too. He posted an image showing he was streaming “Golden,” the huge hit song by the fictional K-pop group Huntr/x from the movie. He even retweeted a post calling “Golden” the most gigantic pop song in memory, proving its massive cultural impact. The movie has become a massive global hit KPop Demon Hunters is not just popular, it is officially Netflix’s most-watched movie ever. Directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans created the film as a collaboration between Sony Pictures Animation and Netflix. If you have not seen it yet, you are missing out on a global phenomenon, and Kojima’s reaction proves it lives up to the hype.

When they are off stage, they use their secret identities as demon hunters to protect their fans from supernatural threats. Their biggest challenge comes from the Saja Boys, an irresistible rival boy band that are actually demons in disguise. The premise alone sounds worth watching, and Kojima’s tearful reaction serves as a top recommendation.

Fans will not have to wait too long either, as the second film is expected to arrive in 2029. It is great that this project is getting a follow-up. Netflix continues to dominate the streaming landscape, even as the Royal Family joins Netflix with their own content ventures. Kojima can create grim post-apocalyptic worlds and still get teary-eyed over a K-pop demon hunter movie. You have to respect someone who can embrace both sides like that. It is also refreshing to see a game design legend known for deep philosophical and dark experiences show such honest love for something emotional and fun.",2025-12-24T00:15:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/movies-tv/it-was-so-so-good-hideo-kojima-reveals-the-netflix-movie-that-made-him-cry-and-hes-not-embarrassed-about-it/,en,0.9911254644393921
"Breaking Bad’ director calls one scene a ‘lightning strike of luck’, it was the show’s only unscripted moment and the actor never returned","The only unscripted line in the entire Breaking Bad series came from baby Holly White during the season five episode Ozymandias . The show is known for its carefully planned scripts and intense drama, so it’s amazing that the most powerful rejection of Walter White came from an unplanned moment. According to LAD Bible , Director Rian Johnson called it a “pure lightning strike of luck that you probably don’t get twice in a lifetime.” The show creator said the unscripted line and Bryan Cranston’s decision to stay in character was one of the “best performances in the whole series.” Writer Moira Walley-Beckett said the line “broke his heart wide open” and was “more than I could ever have hoped for in the writing.” The Ozymandias episode includes several intense moments, like Hank’s death and the complete fall of Walter’s meth empire. After Hank dies, Walt argues with Skyler and Walt Jr. and can’t convince them to leave with him. He takes baby Holly and drives away, kidnapping her as everything falls apart. The baby’s improvised moment changed everything for Walter White The unscripted scene happens when Walt changes Holly’s diaper in a public restroom. The actress playing Holly, Moira Bryg MacDonald, wasn’t given any lines. She was just supposed to react to her mother standing off-camera. But while Walt interacts with her, the baby looks away and keeps saying “Mama.” This moment is heartbreaking for Walt. He’s trying to hold onto the last piece of his family life, and his own baby rejects him by calling for her mother. It’s the final rejection from his family. Bryan Cranston stayed completely in character during the scene and used the improvised line, making it the emotional turning point that forces him to return Holly to Skyler before running away alone. It’s been over 13 years since the finale ended Walter White’s story from chemistry teacher to drug lord, and fans still talk about this moment. Similar to how Steve Rogers’ return sparked debate , iconic TV moments continue to resonate with audiences long after they air. Moira Bryg MacDonald made Breaking Bad history with that unforgettable unplanned line, but she didn’t continue acting afterward. She hasn’t appeared in any film or TV show since the series ended, which makes sense since she was just a baby.

Previous actresses Haven Tomlin and Elanor Anne Wenrich also haven’t had any acting credits since the show. These actors are still children, so it makes sense they’re focused on growing up and having normal childhoods instead of pursuing acting careers. MacDonald will always be remembered for delivering one of the most powerful and heartbreaking moments in the show’s history.

"Rand Paul reveals $1 million government expense that taught ferrets to binge-drink alcohol, and that wasn’t even the most insane animal experiment","Senator Rand Paul is back with his annual takedown of government spending, revealing a jaw-dropping $1.6 trillion in government waste this year, including millions spent on teaching ferrets to binge-drink alcohol and dosing dogs with cocaine, as per Fox News . The Kentucky Republican unveiled his 11th annual “Festivus Report,” detailing some truly wonky and questionable ways the federal government is dumping taxpayer dollars into pet projects and obscure studies. Paul has always been the top fiscal hawk in Congress, routinely voting against giant spending packages because he thinks Washington isn’t serious about tackling the growing debt. He believes that even when lawmakers talk tough about fiscal discipline, they just can’t help but spend more. In this report, Paul noted that the grand total of $1,639,135,969,608 includes a staggering $1.22 trillion dedicated just to interest payments on the national debt. “No matter how much taxpayer money Washington burns through, politicians can’t help but demand more,” Paul said, setting the tone for his yearly review. He continued, “So, before we get to the Feats of Strength, it’s time for my Airing of (Spending) Grievances.” Paul pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office predicts the government will add an average of $23.9 trillion in debt annually for the next decade. That means the U.S. government will be adding over $6.53 billion of debt every single day for the next ten years. If you break it down further, we’re borrowing over $75,000 every single second. The most unbelievable section of the report highlights the bizarre animal experiments funded by your money. Taxpayers forked over more than $1 million to teach “teenage ferrets to binge-drink alcohol.” And it gets worse: over $5 million was spent to dose dogs with cocaine, and roughly $13 million was dedicated to continuing experiments on beagles. If that wasn’t weird enough, the government also spent over $14 million to teach monkeys how to play a game inspired by the classic show “The Price is Right.” It’s not just animal research that made the list. The report highlighted several programs where money was funneled into projects that completely miss the mark on priorities. For example, Congress previously allocated over $7 billion to build electric vehicle charging stations nationwide. The catch? So far, only 68 have actually been built. That’s an awful return on investment for the amount of cash involved, especially after a major US car manufacturer pulled the plugs on its EV future . ""We borrow over $272 million every hour, we borrow $4.54 million every minute, and we borrow over $75,000 every second.""

Schools received nearly $200 billion in relief money, which was then spent on things like renting out MLB stadiums, paying for rooms at Caesars Palace, and even buying ice cream trucks. Other programs focused on human behavior were equally head-scratching. The government spent over $40 million to hire social media influencers to promote getting the COVID-19 vaccine, specifically targeting racial and ethnic minority groups. Another over $1 million was spent to hire celebrity influencers for anti-drug campaigns targeting “Latinx” communities. Researchers also received over $2 million just to take saliva swabs at electronic dance music festivals in New York City. Paul did laud moves taken by the Trump administration to slash government spending, noting a nearly $9 billion rescissions package that cut funding for public broadcasting and some foreign aid. While he called that action “a good start,” he quickly added that it was “just a drop in the bucket” compared to the tsunami of new debt Congress creates every year, like the “Big Beautiful Bill” that he criticized previously .",2025-12-23T23:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/rand-paul-reveals-1-million-government-expense-that-taught-ferrets-to-binge-drink-alcohol-and-that-wasnt-even-the-most-insane-animal-experiment/,en,0.920569896697998
"The studio behind ‘Silent Hill 2’ remake is working on something for Nintendo, and says it’s doing what no horror game has done before","Bloober Team, the studio that made the Silent Hill 2 remake, Cronos , and Layers of Fear , has shared new details about its secret Nintendo game called Project M . The company is keeping most information hidden, but they dropped some interesting hints about what players can expect. According to Video Games Chronicle , CEO Piotr Babieno said the game will appeal to fans of Resident Evil , Silent Hill , Limbo , and Eternal Darkness . “What I can say is this: fans of Resident Evil , Silent Hill , Limbo , and Eternal Darkness will immediately feel at home.,” Babieno revealed. “That said, Project M introduces a bold twist; one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware.” Babieno admitted it’s very difficult for him to keep the project secret, but said it’s still too early to reveal everything. However, he promised fans will get the first official details very soon. The CEO described Project M as a game where horror fans will feel comfortable right away. But there’s a major twist that makes it different from anything else. He said this unique feature has never been explored in any horror game before, and it can only happen on Nintendo’s system. The game promises a horror experience never seen before Bloober first mentioned Project M in a Polish interview last summer. Back then, Babieno said the team is working with some of the best Nintendo game creators in the world, so they can’t just make an average game.

A video game just generated so much wealth for one province that the government immediately launched a massive new campaign to capitalize on it,"In 2024, Game Science’s Black Myth: Wukong became not only China’s first major blockbuster video game but also a cultural phenomenon that reshaped the tourism industry, as per Travel and Tour World . This action-packed game, which draws inspiration from Chinese folklore, has resulted in a distinct and thriving link between virtual exploration and real-world tourism. The game’s impact, particularly in China’s Shanxi Province, is being hailed as a pioneering example of “player to tourist conversion”, in which gamers who explored these virtual worlds transformed into actual visitors eager to explore the real-life locations depicted in the game. The game’s virtual world is rich with 36 locations that bear a strong resemblance to historical and cultural sites in Shanxi. Of these, 27 are directly inspired by real-world locations, such as ancient temples, lush landscapes, and monumental structures. The region, known for its long history and rich cultural heritage, has seen a remarkable surge in tourist visits. The once virtual locations have transformed into real-world destinations, with enthusiasts travelling across the globe to experience these sites firsthand. This phenomenon has been labelled “player to tourist conversion”, and the results speak volumes about the power of the gaming industry Within just two months of the game’s blockbuster release , ticket sales for Shanxi’s historical sites skyrocketed, surpassing 160 million yuan (approximately $22.7 million USD). This unprecedented spike in revenue was not limited to historical sites alone. Local hotels, restaurants, retail outlets, and transportation services also experienced substantial growth. The game has directly contributed to a wider economic boom in the region, turning Shanxi into a travel hotspot. Search engines recorded a staggering 3,178% increase in queries related to “Shanxi tourism” compared to the year before the game’s release. The game’s virtual settings, coupled with the increased visibility from social media channels, triggered an overwhelming wave of public interest. Social media platforms dedicated to the game and Shanxi’s tourism scene collectively received over 40 billion views, further highlighting the scale of interest.

Tourism organizations in the region swiftly incorporated elements from Black Myth: Wukong into their promotional strategies. New tourism plans and campaigns were designed to meet the growing demand for immersive experiences. These initiatives included creating travel packages, guided tours of in-game locations, and collaborations with local businesses to offer specialized services for gamers. Additionally, Shanxi’s government began working closely with the gaming community to showcase the region’s cultural significance within the context of the game, further solidifying the relationship between digital culture and tangible experiences. Beyond the influence on tourism, the game also sparked cultural engagements within China’s art and exhibition scenes. The Art Museum of China Academy of Art in Hangzhou hosted a special exhibition dedicated to the game. Initially planned to run for just 40 days, the exhibit’s overwhelming popularity led to its extension for an additional 68 days, totalling an impressive 108 days. During its run, the exhibition welcomed a staggering 450,000 visitors, far exceeding initial expectations. Despite daily visitor caps ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 people, the exhibit became a cultural milestone, demonstrating how video games, often seen as entertainment mediums, can deeply influence art and heritage tourism and economic growth.",2025-12-23T23:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/gaming/a-video-game-just-generated-so-much-wealth-for-one-province-that-the-government-immediately-launched-a-massive-new-campaign-to-capitalize-on-it/,en,0.9788680672645569
ICE warns migrants to ‘avoid Santa’s naughty list’ in bizarre video featuring Father Christmas making arrests,"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement released an unusual propaganda video on Monday night that has ignited widespread controversy across social media platforms. The bizarre holiday-themed clip depicts Santa Claus as an immigration enforcement agent who arrests and deports undocumented migrants, transforming the beloved Christmas figure into a symbol of federal deportation operations. According to the NY Post , the video was posted on X as part of a coordinated messaging campaign aimed at encouraging undocumented immigrants to voluntarily leave the United States. The agency’s decision to weaponize Christmas imagery for immigration enforcement purposes represents a dramatic departure from traditional government communications, blending holiday cheer with hardline deportation messaging. The footage features a dramatically reimagined Father Christmas who bears little resemblance to the jolly gift-giver of tradition. Instead of a rotund, cheerful figure in a simple red suit, this version of Santa appears as a muscular, tactical enforcement officer wearing a distinctive red bulletproof vest emblazoned with the ICE logo, creating a jarring fusion of holiday symbolism and federal law enforcement. The holiday deportation incentive comes with a cash bonus Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled a controversial new initiative on Monday designed to encourage voluntary departures of undocumented immigrants through substantial financial incentives. The program, officially titled “Home for the Holidays,” represents a significant escalation in the federal government’s strategy to reduce the undocumented population through economic inducements rather than forced removals. ICE posted the Santa video with a message telling migrants to avoid the “naughty list.” They encouraged people to use the CBP Home app to self-deport, earn the $3,000, and spend Christmas at home with their families. The holiday incentive runs through the end of 2025. Immigrants should also be aware of their legal rights during ICE encounters . AVOID ICE AIR AND SANTA’S NAUGHTY LIST!

This substantial figure represents one of the largest waves of self-deportation in recent American history, reflecting the combined impact of heightened enforcement rhetoric, increased immigration raids, and financial incentive programs designed to encourage migrants to leave without formal removal proceedings. Officials say paying people to leave on their own is cheaper than forced deportation. The government claims it costs an average of $17,000 to arrest, detain, and deport each illegal migrant. The self-deportation program aims to reduce these costs while encouraging voluntary departures. However, the devastating impact of deportation on immigrants remains a serious concern for many families.",2025-12-23T22:45:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/ice-warns-migrants-to-avoid-santas-naughty-list-in-bizarre-video-featuring-father-christmas-making-arrests/,en,0.7187003493309021
"A group ripped 300TB of content off Spotify to make the largest public music ‘preservation archive’, but the company is coming to ruin the whole thing","Spotify has officially responded to Anna’s Archive’s massive music scraping project, confirming they have identified and disabled the “nefarious user accounts” responsible for the unlawful data theft, as per Android Authority . This response is definitely aggressive and shows the company isn’t messing around when it comes to copyright issues. The platform released a statement addressing the claims, “Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping. We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior. Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.” So, what exactly did Anna’s Archive pull off to warrant this official counter-attack? This group, which you might know better for backing up books and research papers, claims it scraped almost the entirety of the music streaming giant. This is an enormous archive, weighing in at just under 300TB. The group says they archived metadata for 256 million tracks and audio files for 86 million songs. They insist this coverage represents around 99.6% of all listens on Spotify. If that sounds enormous, it is Anna’s Archive says this database is now the largest publicly available music metadata database in the entire world. The group is trying to frame this massive data rip as a “preservation archive” for modern music. They argue that while the super-popular songs are probably backed up everywhere, huge chunks of lesser-known music could totally disappear if streaming platforms lose licenses or unexpectedly shut down. They said this is “a great start” for preserving modern music history. Let’s be clear: this project is not legal. Spotify licenses almost all of its music from rights holders and record labels under strict legal terms. Mass-scraping these files and then redistributing them via bulk torrents violates Spotify’s terms of service. Worse, it violates copyright law in many countries. Copyright law generally doesn’t make exceptions for something like “good intentions,” even if Anna’s Archive is genuinely worried about preservation rather than just straight-up piracy. World’s largest shadow library made a 300TB copy of Spotify’s most streamed songs https://t.co/HZ0uiD1wAW — Liberation Technology (@Liberationtech) December 23, 2025 The technical side of the archive is interesting, though. The audio itself mostly comes straight from Spotify. To save space, popular tracks are stored in their original 160kbps format, but less-played songs were re-encoded into smaller files. Right now, only the metadata is fully available to the public. The actual music files are being released gradually, starting with the most popular tracks first. You should also know that anything released after July 2025 may be missing from this massive archive. Before this recent statement, Spotify had indicated they had identified “that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform’s audio files.” That older statement avoided confirming the sheer scale that Anna’s Archive described. Spotify now says only “some” of its audio files were accessed, which contradicts Anna’s Archive’s audacious claim that they archived music covering 99.6% of all listens. It’s completely unclear how much of the platform was truly affected or whether Spotify and the major record companies will pursue full legal action to yank the scraped data off the torrent networks. We have seen crackdowns on some anime piracy sites in recent years . While they can’t do much about AI music , we’ll definitely have to wait and see if they can put the genie back in the bottle on this one.",2025-12-23T22:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/a-group-ripped-300tb-of-content-off-spotify-to-make-the-largest-public-music-preservation-archive-but-the-company-is-coming-to-ruin-the-whole-thing/,en,0.8385792374610901
"A$AP Rocky tries to promote his new album on Reddit, mods keep deleting his posts and he’s not happy about it","A$AP Rocky is angry because Reddit moderators keep removing his posts about his new album, Don’t Be Dumb. The rapper tried to share his music directly with fans on subreddits like r/HipHopHeads, but the posts kept getting deleted. This frustrated the “Long Live A$AP” artist, who thought connecting with fans on Reddit would be simple. Many musicians use social media platforms like X, Instagram, and Facebook to promote new releases. Rocky decided to try Reddit to reach dedicated fan communities. However, he quickly ran into problems with the platform’s strict rules about self-promotion. According to Dexerto , Rocky didn’t hide his anger when his Reddit posts kept disappearing. He wrote in all caps: “MODS STOP DELETING MY COMMENTS.” He questioned whether artists need to “CHECK IN WITH MODS TO PUSH THEY MUSIC 4 FANS?” He ended his complaint with his album title: “DON’T BE DUMB.” Even celebrities can’t escape Reddit’s self-promotion rules The deletions weren’t limited to text posts. Rocky also tried uploading videos, but those were removed immediately too. “IT WAS UP FOR 1 SECOND. AUTO TAKEDOWN,” he said. Some fans made fun of the moderators for blocking the actual artist from sharing his own music. Rocky later claimed he was following the rules, writing “DONT BE DUMB I FOLLOW THE RULES.” The problem likely happened because of a missing step in the promotion process. When big artists want to promote music on Reddit, their record labels or PR teams usually contact the subreddit moderators first. This coordination makes sure the posts don’t look like spam and don’t break the community’s self-promotion rules.

"Proposed Trump administration rules will destroy everything the Endangered Species Act saved, including this iconic animal that almost went extinct","Conservation advocate and popular streamer Maya Higa just used her massive platform on TikTok to call out the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) put forward by the Trump administration. Higa urged her viewers to listen up because the administration’s plans could seriously harm wildlife that is already struggling to survive. In her video , Higa explained that these rules are explicitly designed to roll back crucial protections under the ESA. If these plans go through, oil, gas, logging, and mining companies could basically dictate habitat protection. Higa warned that land, climate, and animal welfare concerns will inevitably take a back seat, “no matter what the costs are to wildlife and to our climate and to our lands.” She didn’t mince words about the situation, saying plainly, “It sucks.” This proposed rollback is especially frustrating because the ESA is the country’s strongest tool for protecting species at risk. Higa pointed to clear successes, noting that hundreds of species almost went extinct but didn’t because of the ESA. Think about the bald eagle, the black-footed ferret, and the gray wolf. These are, in fact, not African animals , but iconic animals of this land that we’d hate to lose, and the protections need to stay in place to ensure that. When Higa talks about conservation, you should definitely listen up Besides being a content creator, Higa is the founder and executive director of Alveus Sanctuary in central Texas. She’s worked as a licensed falconer, a wildlife rehabilitator, a zookeeper, and a conservation educator. Plus, she’s recognized as one of Twitch’s top female streamers, in contrast to some of her more questionable counterparts . You might even remember her from her incredibly viral livestreams featuring Winnie the Cow, who famously began demanding that Twitch viewers donate to give her treats. Higa’s streams often combine education with major fundraising efforts. For example, her conservation podcast back in 2019 raised over $92,000 for various conservation groups. Her track record shows she knows what she’s talking about when it comes to saving animals. @maya_higa pls click the link in my bio to help ♬ original sound – maya_higa Higa opened her recent video with a straightforward appeal to her followers. “Hey, guys, I meant to talk to you about this sooner,” she said, explaining that she felt compelled to speak immediately. She stressed that wildlife already has it really, really freaking hard, so threats that make it harder are simply unacceptable. The good news is that these proposed rules aren’t final yet. Higa strongly encouraged people to take public action right away. We have until December 22 to show that the public overwhelmingly supports protecting wildlife. She framed participation as a simple but incredibly meaningful step, urging people to submit comments through the link in her bio. Asking viewers to participate, she added, “That’s my Christmas present.” She emphasized that it’s crucial to act now and ensure that this vital piece of legislation continues to protect the animals that need it most.",2025-12-23T22:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/proposed-trump-administration-rules-will-destroy-everything-the-endangered-species-act-saved-including-this-iconic-animal-that-almost-went-extinct/,en,0.968383252620697
"A man says he lived an ‘entire different life’ in a dream and remembers everything, including something dark about Trump’s future","A man on Reddit claims he lived 51 years inside a dream and saw something disturbing happen to President Donald Trump in 2027. While most people’s dreams are boring and forgettable, this person says he experienced an entirely different life and remembers almost everything from it. According to Unilad , the Reddit post went up on December 22, and the man shared detailed memories from his dream life. He even remembered specific details like his wife’s appearance. She was 5’4″ with blonde hair and blue eyes, and he said she looked like a female version of Kurt Cobain, the famous Nirvana singer. In the dream, he married her in 2028 when he was 28 years old. When someone asked if he remembered any political events, he shared a dark prediction about Trump’s future. He claims that in his dream, Trump gets assassinated in 2027 during an international trip to Japan. According to his account, a sniper attacks Trump at the airport when he lands to meet with Takaichi. The shooter is never caught but is believed to be a member of the US military. The dream included wild predictions about American politics After Trump’s death in the dream, JD Vance finishes the presidential term but loses the next election to California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom then serves two terms as president. After him, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez serves one term, followed by Pete Buttigieg who serves two terms. This would mean the Democratic Party wins five presidential terms in a row. However, the dreamer later added that Newsom and Buttigieg actually split from the Democrats and created a new political party. Still, five straight terms for one party would be historic. The current record is four consecutive terms between 1933 and 1945, which was also achieved by Democrats. Trump has recently made controversial decisions, including declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction , which drew immediate criticism. The man explained that he felt like he lived every single second of those 51 years. But just like real life, he doesn’t remember everything perfectly. He compared it to trying to remember what you ate for breakfast seven years ago. The memories exist but some details fade over time. He described the experience as feeling unreal and hard to explain. He said it felt like he was living in another person’s body rather than having two separate identities. The dream version had a similar personality to him, and he thinks they would have been good friends in real life. Meanwhile, in real-world politics, Trump’s envoy outlined controversial plans for Greenland that sparked international debate. One Reddit user suggested this could be lucid dreaming, where people sometimes have trouble telling the difference between real events and dream events. When someone asked if it was a happy life, the dreamer simply replied that it was very happy and he smiles when thinking back on it.",2025-12-23T21:45:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/a-man-says-he-lived-an-entire-different-life-in-a-dream-and-remembers-everything-including-something-dark-about-trumps-future/,en,0.9397060871124268
"She spent months finding the perfect wedding accessory for her fiancé, then he asked one brutal question that ripped her heart out","TikTok user Ella Richman recently shared the story of a major Christmas gift fail after her fiancé openly disliked the expensive, thoughtful present she bought him. The viral video , which has racked up over 1.6 million views, shows how good intentions don’t always translate into a gift the other person actually wants. Ella and her fiancé, Sam, are set to tie the knot next September, and she admitted that she bought him what she genuinely thought was the most perfect holiday gift, only for him to hate it immediately. The tricky part of this whole situation is that Ella knew her fiancé’s style preferences well. She said he is someone who absolutely does not adorn himself, explaining that he doesn’t wear a watch, hates logos, and wants his sense of style to be very muted. Because of his minimalist taste, she was especially excited about one specific detail for their wedding: cuff links. This was going to be the first and only jewelry-type thing she’d ever be able to get him to wear, she figured, since you need to wear cuff links with a tux. I totally get why she thought this was the perfect opportunity to buy him something meaningful that they could both appreciate. Ella wanted something special yet subtle that would fit both him and their Hamptons wedding vibe She spent months researching options, comparing vintage pieces with new designs. She finally landed on a shop in New York City called The Missing Link, which is famous for providing vintage cuff links often featured in film and TV productions. The gift she chose was a pair of 14-karat gold cuff links from the 1940s that featured a very light blue, almost gray stone. They even came with matching shirt buttons. Then came the moment of truth. Sam opened the box and gave a truly brutal reaction. Ella recounted the exact question he asked: “What about me makes you think that I would like these?” He also told her that he thought the cuff links were “girly.” That is awful for someone who spent so much time and effort trying to get the perfect gift, especially when she was hoping he might just need time to come around to them. @ella.richman Sorry I’m long winded but can I get some hype for these please we need to convince Sam to keep them #weddinggift #boyfriendgifts ♬ original sound – ella After Ella posted the video hoping for reassurance, many viewers sadly sided with Sam. While it didn’t reach the Auschwitz birthday cake territory , one person mocked the situation pretty directly, saying, “Bro got … cuff links for Christmas.” Another commenter pointed out the mismatch between effort and intent, writing, “You spoke about why the gift was perfect for the wedding, but not about why it’s perfect for him.” Ouch, that’s a tough pill to swallow, but the consensus was clear. One viewer stated, “You’re thinking of the wedding, not him and his likes.” Others were even more blunt, with one saying, “I hate siding with a man but girl u got those for u not him.” Another commenter noted that being loved is about being seen, suggesting, “This gift made him feel invisible from a woman he recently proposed to. Yikes.” This whole ordeal is a prime example of why gifting can be so difficult, even when you know someone intimately. And yes, this can happen even after smooth dates, unlike ones that leave you confused .",2025-12-23T21:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/she-spent-months-finding-the-perfect-wedding-accessory-for-her-fiance-then-he-asked-one-brutal-question-that-ripped-her-heart-out/,en,0.9347335696220398
"Trump makes bizarre claim about US history while discussing Greenland takeover, apparently 1776 slipped his mind","President Trump made a major historical mistake this week when he said the United States has been around for 300 years. He made this error on Monday while talking about his plans to acquire Greenland. During a press conference, Trump announced that Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, would serve as a special envoy to the territory. According to The London Economic , Trump compared the possible Greenland deal to the Louisiana Purchase, when the US bought that large area from France in 1803. He called Landry a “deal-maker type guy,” which shows he wants serious negotiations to start soon. The president clearly still wants to add Greenland to American territory. Things went wrong when Trump started questioning why Greenland still belongs to Denmark. He said Denmark has spent no money on the territory and provides no military protection. Then he made his historical error. Trump claimed, “They say that Denmark was there 300 years ago with a boat, well, we were there with boats too I’m sure.” The president’s timeline is off by several decades If you do the math, 300 years ago would be 1725. That’s a serious mistake because the United States wasn’t founded until 1776. This means the country is currently about 249 years old, not 300. The difference matters a lot when comparing national histories. In 1725, the territory that would become the United States was still a collection of British colonies. There was no unified government, no Constitution, and no independent nation. The American Revolution wouldn’t begin for another 50 years. The real history of Greenland makes Trump’s error even worse. Norse Vikings reached Greenland around 985 AD. Denmark set up colonies there in 1721. This means Denmark was actively colonizing Greenland more than 50 years before the USA even existed as an independent nation. This isn’t the first time Trump has disrupted major programs with controversial decisions. Trump: We need Greenland for national protection. They have a very small population…They say that Denmark was there 300 years ago with a boat. Well, we were there with boats too I’m sure. pic.twitter.com/NqIAs2aeO0 — Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) December 22, 2025 Trump suggested the US had boats sailing around 300 years ago, but that’s simply not true. The nation didn’t exist yet at that time. In 1725, the land that would become America was still made up of British colonies. People on social media quickly caught the mistake. A community note appeared on X under a video clip of Trump’s statements, correcting the historical error. The note pointed out the actual founding date of the United States. The president’s team has faced public criticism from protesters recently over various policy issues. This incident shows that even when important appointments are being made, basic facts still matter. Historical accuracy is important, especially when discussing territorial claims and national histories.",2025-12-23T21:15:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/trump-makes-bizarre-claim-about-us-history-while-discussing-greenland-takeover-apparently-1776-slipped-his-mind/,en,0.9478904604911804
"A woman demanded a late-night McDonald’s meal, and the staff’s bizarre response was policy-breaking chaos","TikTok user Kae (@kae_doll) managed to score a bizarre, policy-breaking late-night meal after convincing McDonald’s staff to sell her frozen Filet-O-Fish patties instead of cooking them, as reported by BroBible . Kae posted a video showing herself outside the location, confirming she was able to pay for a box containing a stack of uncooked fish patties. It seems the staff just really wanted to close up shop and go home. There’s a huge, ongoing online debate about whether it’s rude to visit a store right before closing time. While technically allowed, many customers agree that it’s just bad manners, and I think they have a point. Closing a store involves tons of extra work, and employees usually want to finish these critical steps as fast as possible to clock out. When you show up right before the doors shut, you’re delaying their final departure time, and nobody wants that. Some stores try to manage this by advertising that their “last sale” occurs before their actual closing time. However, this McDonald’s location found a far more unorthodox solution. Kae’s approach to this late-night dilemma was definitely outside the norm She explained in the video that the staff was not interested in making the fish sandwich. She told them, “f* it, give me the fish fillets. I’m gonna cook it at home.” You can tell she really loves her Filet-O-Fish, continuing, “I love me a fish fillet. Like, I don’t give a f*.” She summarized the situation in a text overlay on the video: “POV : McDonald’s didn’t want to cook anymore fish filets late night so you paid for some frozen patties.” In a follow-up video , Kae confirmed she was successful in deep-frying the patties at home. Not only did she get the frozen fish, but the restaurant also provided her with the necessary extras. They gave her buns, tartar sauce, and fries “for the inconvenience.” That’s actually a pretty solid customer service move, even if it completely breaks the rules of the store without breaching the territory of the free food loophole . @kae_doll yall want one? #fyp #fy #mcdonalds #food #foodtiktok ♬ original sound – KAEDOLL And breaking the rules is exactly what this was. You generally can’t just walk into a McDonald’s and buy frozen ingredients. While chains sometimes sell their own branded retail products, like packaged coffee, they absolutely do not allow customers to purchase frozen versions of menu items like McNuggets or fish filets from their stores. Current and former employees commenting on Reddit confirmed that selling frozen items goes against corporate policy, usually due to obvious liability reasons. This is a massive risk for the company. If you buy frozen food and cook it incorrectly at home, the company doesn’t want to be responsible for any resulting issues. It’s highly likely the specific location Kae visited simply ignored the rules in this one instance just to get her out the door and start their closing procedures. I guess we can forgive them, especially with the worsening work conditions for workers across fast food chains .",2025-12-23T21:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/a-woman-demanded-a-late-night-mcdonalds-meal-and-the-staffs-bizarre-response-was-policy-breaking-chaos/,en,0.8392695188522339
"‘The Voice’ alum who kissed Christina Aguilera arrested after multi-state manhunt, and TikTok fans helped track her down","Kata Hay, a former contestant from singing competition show The Voice , was arrested in Oklahoma. Police had been searching for her across multiple states because of a vehicular homicide warrant. She is now being held at the Osage County Jail. According to AOL , the Goodlettsville Police Department had asked for public help to find Hay just one day before her arrest. They posted her photo online a day before her arrest, showing the 38-year-old wearing a black-and-white prison jumpsuit. The charges against her are connected to a car crash that happened in Davidson County, Tennessee. Police said Hay’s arrest happened after investigators received numerous tips from the public about her whereabouts. TikTok users proved instrumental in locating her by monitoring her social media activity and promptly relaying crucial information to law enforcement authorities. TikTok sleuths became unexpected heroes in this criminal case Law enforcement officials credited the vigilant online community for their role in the arrest, noting that the volume and quality of tips they received significantly accelerated the investigation. Hay is currently charged as a fugitive from justice. She is waiting to be sent back to Tennessee to face the vehicular homicide charge. Her legal name is Kata Huddleston. Many people remember Hay from her appearance on The Voice in 2016. She auditioned with the song Redneck Woman by Gretchen Wilson. Almost all the coaches turned their chairs around, except Blake Shelton. Similar to other celebrity legal troubles, YouTube star Jack Doherty’s recent arrest also made headlines after police found something in his possession.

During the pitch session, she told Aguilera that the famous singer was her first “girl crush.” Aguilera responded by suggesting they should “just make out now” to “get it over with so we can get to work.” The two then kissed on stage, creating a memorable moment. Hay made it to the Top 20 before getting eliminated. Since leaving the show, Hay has faced several legal problems. In 2022, she was arrested in Sumner County, Tennessee, for having sexual contact with a minor. She pleaded guilty and served a six-month sentence. This case joins other shocking criminal cases, like when a 7-year-old boy was discovered in a freezer under horrifying circumstances. When Hay was arrested in 2022, she was already on probation for a DUI charge from 2017. With the new vehicular homicide warrant, she now faces serious legal consequences ahead.",2025-12-23T20:45:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/true-crime/the-voice-alum-who-kissed-christina-aguilera-arrested-after-multi-state-manhunt-and-tiktok-fans-helped-track-her-down/,en,0.8869560360908508
The FBI looked away and now this designated neo-Nazi terror cell headed by an ex-Pentagon contractor is training openly in the US,"The neo-Nazi terrorist group known as the Base, once a major target for FBI counter-terrorism efforts, is openly escalating its operations and calling for an armed insurgency right here in the United States, as per The Guardian . While the group has been busy expanding its reach into Europe, new online activities show that the US remains its operational nerve center, with cells actively training and preparing for violence. The group is headed by Rinaldo Nazzaro, an ex-Pentagon contractor who is reportedly now a Russian intelligence asset. He recently released an audio recording bragging about the Base’s long-term strategic goal. Nazzaro said, “Our long-term strategic goal is to accomplish something similar to what al-Qaida and IS accomplished in Syria.” He wants to “Form an organized, armed insurgency to take and hold territory. And establish a white homeland which we control and govern.” He concluded that only two traditionally white nations possess all the necessary prerequisites for this goal: Ukraine and the United States. This isn’t just empty talk; the Base has an active footprint here. Videos released in November show masked men shooting military-style rifles and pistols in what they claim is an Appalachian forest. Another June photo from that same Appalachian cell captures five armed men in skull masks holding rifles and brandishing the Base’s black flag. We’ve also seen a mid-Atlantic cell performing “Sieg Heil” salutes and a Midwest cell firing pistols It looks like the Base feels free to organize and prepare for their objective of fomenting an armed insurgency against the US government. This is happening because the FBI, under the shifting political climate of the second Trump administration, has openly rerouted resources away from investigating far-right extremists . Several sources have noted that the FBI has looked away from what is statistically the most dangerous domestic terrorist threat facing the US, even mocking it as part of a “woke” agenda. Nazzaro has explicitly expanded his endorsement of violence, calling for the establishment of “acceleration teams.” Steven Rai, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) who monitors the group, described this as a “troubling escalation.” These teams are aimed at destabilizing society and weakening government authority through attacks on critical infrastructure. When the Base and other far-right groups strike, Trump and Kash will have even more American blood on their hands. This is why the whole ""foreign and domestic"" threat is in the oath. ""Neo-Nazi terror group steps up US operations as FBI pulls back"" https://t.co/Gc8r9r9gt5 — Am I a cat? You decide. (@CatGrah17554541) December 23, 2025 On VKontakte, a Russian social media platform where the Base maintains an account, the group explicitly called for cells to use “targeted attacks on essential infrastructure and resources.” They believe these consistent attacks could contribute to the country’s political fragmentation over time, which has been a theme even across the Atlantic ocean . The Base’s international activity shows just how serious the threat is. The European Union has declared it a terrorist group, putting it in the same league as Islamic State and al-Qaida. Its Ukrainian wing is linked to multiple acts of terrorism, including the high-profile July assassination of an intelligence officer in Kyiv, and this cell is seen by the Base as a model of active insurgency. The Base is no longer just an obscure American problem, especially with legitimate questions surrounding its links to Russian sabotage operations. Nazzaro even mentioned in his audio clip that he sees instability in “Canada or the European Union” as promising for recruitment, in his first explicit mention of Canadian activities in years. However, analyst Steven Rai thinks Nazzaro may have inadvertently increased the group’s exposure to intervention by law enforcement. Rai pointed out that by providing Base operatives in the United States with explicit strategic guidance centered around violence, Nazzaro might just provide the legal space authorities need to crack down on this designated terrorist organization.",2025-12-23T20:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/the-fbi-looked-away-and-now-this-designated-neo-nazi-terror-cell-headed-by-an-ex-pentagon-contractor-is-training-openly-in-the-us/,en,0.9718326330184937
"Texas high school football player facing charges after allegedly shooting teammate, but his explanation to police raises questions","Xavier Mayfield, an 18-year-old high school football player, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after he allegedly shot a teammate in the neck. The incident happened just hours after their championship victory. Mayfield plays safety for South Oak Cliffs High School in Dallas. According to People , the shooting took place at a home on the 6400 block of Knoll Ridge Drive in Dallas. The victim, whose name has not been released, was shot in the neck and taken to a local hospital. He is now in stable condition. Mayfield is being held in Dallas County Jail with his bond set at $50,000. Mayfield’s story to police has raised serious questions about what actually happened that night. He told officers he was on the second floor of the house, walking from the bathroom to his bedroom, when the victim called his name. According to Mayfield, he turned around and a single shot went off from the AR-style rifle he was holding. Carrying an AR-style rifle between rooms seems highly suspicious The key issue here is why Mayfield was carrying an AR-style rifle while simply moving between a bathroom and bedroom. This detail makes his claim of an accidental shooting very hard to believe. It’s extremely unusual for someone to be walking around a house with that type of weapon for no clear reason. After the shooting, Mayfield said he tried to drive the victim to the hospital himself and called 911 before leaving the house. While this shows he was concerned about getting help quickly, it doesn’t explain why he had the weapon in the first place or how it discharged. In other legal news, a Texas rancher faces a lawsuit from State Farm over a confusing dispute.

They confirmed the victim was Mayfield’s teammate and insisted there was no intent to harm anyone. Even if this was truly an accident, the charges reflect how serious it is to have an AR-style rifle go off and injure someone in the neck. Mayfield should have been celebrating his team’s championship win, but instead he’s sitting in jail facing major legal problems. The shocking nature of the charges mirrors other disturbing cases where seemingly innocent situations turned into serious criminal matters. This case will likely get a lot of attention from the community as more details come out.

"Following Bill Cinton’s hot tub photo reveal, former president’s top aide slams DOJ instead, claiming ‘someone or something is being protected’","Bill Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Ureña, is publicly demanding that the Department of Justice release all remaining documents related to the former president in files concerning Jeffrey Epstein, claiming that “someone or something is being protected,” as per The Hill . This strong statement, which Ureña made Monday on X, comes just days after the DOJ released an initial batch of controversial photos involving President Clinton. If you were wondering why the Clinton team is suddenly pushing so hard for transparency, it’s because the initial document dump featured some pretty eyebrow-raising images. One photo shows President Clinton sitting in a hot tub with an unidentified person . Another image shows a hidden-identity woman sitting directly on his lap. It’s important to note that President Clinton has not actually been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or his awful sex-trafficking ring. Despite the lack of formal accusations, Ureña is adamant that the public needs to see everything the DOJ has. He cited the Epstein Files Transparency Act, saying the department is required to “produce the full and complete record the public demands and deserves.” Congressional lawmakers echo Ureña’s accusation against the DOJ Ureña didn’t hold back his personal assessment of the situation, either. He believes that the manner in which the DOJ released the documents, along with the information it has provided so far, makes one thing perfectly clear.”Someone or something is being protected,” Ureña stated. “We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection.” It turns out that congressional lawmakers are echoing Ureña’s frustrations. Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, who co-sponsored the transparency law, have already criticized the DOJ. They believe the department isn’t releasing everything it holds on Epstein and has been redacting too many names of individuals mentioned within the files . pic.twitter.com/tk4Tki6Wp1 — Angel Ureña (@angelurena) December 22, 2025 The official stance from President Clinton’s team has remained consistent. Just last Friday, Ureña had posted that President Clinton was among those who “knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light.” This whole situation gets a little more complex when you look at the historical context. Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Epstein’s accomplice, was honored at a Clinton Global Initiative event in 2013. This is noteworthy because that event happened years after Maxwell had already been accused of assisting the disgraced financier in his crimes. It seems like we’re nowhere near the end of this story. With President Clinton’s deputy chief of staff demanding full transparency and bipartisan lawmakers agreeing that the DOJ is hiding documents, the pressure is mounting for the department to release the unredacted truth. You can bet the House committee is going to be watching closely as that December 17 deadline approaches.",2025-12-23T20:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/following-bill-cintons-hot-tub-photo-reveal-former-presidents-top-aide-slams-doj-instead-claiming-someone-or-something-is-being-protected/,en,0.9066097736358643
"JD Vance completes intense Navy SEAL training session in California, but there’s one detail about his appearance that breaks the rules","Vice President JD Vance finished a tough 90-minute beach workout with Navy SEALs in California. The training included running, rope climbing, and carrying heavy logs. But the most interesting part was that Vance was the only person in the photos who had a beard, which goes against a new military policy. According to the NY Post , the workout happened at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, where SEALs do their famous Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training, called BUD/S. This training is extremely hard, and only about 20% of people make it through “Hell Week.” Even though the SEALs went easier on him, Vance said he still felt destroyed after the session. The Marine veteran posted on X saying, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train.” He thanked the Armed Forces for keeping the country safe and maintaining the highest standards in the world. Vance gets special treatment while others follow strict grooming rules This situation is interesting because War Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a policy in August that stops most service members from having beards. Hegseth said “no more beardos” and wants all military members to be “fit, not fat.” Vance has praised Hegseth for pushing these high standards, but clearly doesn’t follow the same rules himself. Vance talked about this policy in October. He said when he was a young Marine, he did not have a beard. But he explained that as vice president, he operates under different rules. Vance simply said, “I get to do what I want to do.” The vice president has faced criticism over controversial comments in recent months. Just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes (I'll post some photos when I get them). They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world! — JD Vance (@JDVance) December 22, 2025 The vice president is following a similar pattern as Hegseth, who often posts videos of himself working out with troops.

"A sitting president claims that two massive US states are ‘invaded’ territory, sparking a bizarre meltdown from Donald Trump","Colombian President Gustavo Petro dropped a political bombshell recently, claiming that huge parts of the United States, including Texas and California, are actually “invaded territory.” This incredibly aggressive assertion immediately prompted a fiery, personal reaction from President Trump, who publicly warned the Colombian leader that “he better watch his a***.” That is definitely not the kind of reserved, diplomatic language you usually hear, but it shows just how high tensions are running between the two leaders. According to The Hill , President Trump made the comment at Mar-a-Lago just after announcing plans for building new Navy ships. President Trump didn’t mince words about why he was so upset, focusing heavily on drug trafficking and alleged cocaine manufacturing. He stated that Petro has drug factories making cocaine in Colombia and sending it straight into the United States. While the president emphasized that he loves the Colombian people, he called their new leader a “troublemaker.” He issued a direct demand that Petro close up those cocaine factories, claiming, “There are at least three major cocaine factories. We know where they are.” This serious accusation highlights the administration’s apparent frustration with the continuous flow of narcotics Petro specifically said over the weekend that Texas, California, and the entire southern U.S. were invaded, not sold. He made this claim while responding to a question about the U.S. demanding that Venezuela return assets it seized in the past from U.S. oil companies. This entire situation is simmering because Petro and President Trump sit on opposite ends of the political spectrum. Petro is actually the first left-leaning leader Colombia has had in recent history. The Colombian leader believes that the U.S. pressure campaign on Venezuela isn’t about upholding democracy or fighting drug trafficking at all . In an interview last month, Petro stated that oil is at the center of Trump’s logic and his campaign against Venezuela. He said, “So, that’s a negotiation about oil. I believe that is Trump’s logic. He’s not thinking about the democratization of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking.” President Trump lashed out at Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Monday, warning that “he better watch his a‑‑.” https://t.co/SlJmDDyW0s — Border Report (@BorderReportcom) December 23, 2025 It’s clear this conflict has been escalating for a while now. Tensions are already high between the U.S. and Venezuela as oil tankers continue to be seized in the Caribbean. President Trump already hit Petro and his family members with sanctions back in October. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the administration is taking strong action because Petro “has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.” Bessent stated that President Trump is taking this action to protect the nation and make it clear that the U.S. will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into the country.",2025-12-23T19:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/a-sitting-president-claims-that-two-massive-us-states-are-invaded-territory-sparking-a-bizarre-meltdown-from-donald-trump/,en,0.8582741022109985
‘I don’t want another Afghanistan or Iraq’: These Republic lawmakers just torpadoed Trump’s Venezuela strategy,"Republican lawmakers are seriously divided over President Trump’s aggressive push against Venezuela, as per The Hill . And some senators are actively warning that escalating military pressure to oust President Nicolás Maduro could dangerously backfire on the United States. While the majority of Senate Republicans are on board with President Trump’s strategy of targeting Venezuelan speedboats suspected of drug smuggling, several key figures are expressing concern that striking land targets or putting “boots on the ground” crosses a major red line. This is a big issue because the president himself threatened last month that U.S. strikes against Venezuela could begin “very soon.” One Republican senator, who chose to remain anonymous to speak freely, was crystal clear about the risks. “I do not want to put ground troops in Venezuela. I don’t want to have another Afghanistan or Iraq,” the senator said, adding, “I’m not in favor of U.S.-directed regime change.” This tension highlights a major conflict within the Republican Party Conservatives who align with the America First movement have consistently warned against the United States getting tangled up in endless foreign wars, and yet President Trump’s actions in the Caribbean Sea are starting to look like an expansion of military operations, especially with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth refusing to release full military strike videos . Sen. Rand Paul is one of the most outspoken critics of the administration’s strategy. He believes the administration is pursuing regime change in Venezuela and flatly declared, “I’m opposed to it.” Paul argued that the president is acting arbitrarily by blowing up Venezuelan boats while, earlier this month, pardoning the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández. Hernández was sentenced to 45 years for partnering with cocaine traffickers to move drugs into the US. Republicans divided on whether Trump should topple Venezuela’s Maduro with military force https://t.co/OiIy2bymqb — The Hill (@thehill) December 23, 2025 Paul thinks the administration is bypassing Congress’s constitutional authority to declare war by simply declaring “war against people we designate to be terrorists.” He noted, “Now they’re designating the government terrorists.” Because of these concerns, Paul has teamed up with Senate Democrats to file a war powers resolution. This measure aims to block U.S. armed forces from engaging in hostilities against Venezuela without receiving authorization from Congress. Despite the growing opposition, some administration officials have tried to calm congressional fears. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told senators in a briefing last week that regime change is not their goal in Venezuela . Rubio “said repeatedly that regime change is not the policy of the United States; it was not the focus of the anti-narcotrafficking policy,” according to one senator who attended the briefing. However, those assurances were seriously undercut by comments made by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Wiles told journalist Chris Whipple in an interview that regime change is absolutely President Trump’s goal. “He wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle,” Wiles said. She did suggest that if President Trump wanted to order land strikes, he would need Congress’s authority first.",2025-12-23T19:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/i-dont-want-another-afghanistan-or-iraq-these-republic-lawmakers-just-torpadoed-trumps-venezuela-strategy/,en,0.685619056224823
"Fans of this gacha game just raised a staggering amount of money for a run-down farm, all because of one in-game reference","Fans of the popular gacha game and anime series Umamusume: Pretty Derby recently raised a huge amount of money for a struggling horse farm. The Northern Lake Farm, which takes care of the retired racehorse Meisho Doto, started a crowdfunding campaign in October. Their goal was to raise 15 million yen, which is about $95,000 USD, to fix their old and broken stables. But the campaign didn’t just meet that goal. It completely shattered it. When the fundraiser ended, they had raised almost 125 million yen, which is nearly $800,000 USD. That’s over 800% more than what they originally asked for. According to PC Gamer , the entire thing happened because of one horse and his connection to the game. The reason fans donated so much money is because of Meisho Doto himself. He’s a real retired racehorse who inspired one of the “horse girl” characters in the Umamusume series. The farm needed money to fix their damaged horse buildings, but they never actually used Meisho Doto’s name to get more donations. They just wanted to repair their stables. The fanbase took matters into their own hands Fans of the game and anime didn’t need the farm to ask for help. They saw the campaign and started spreading the word on the internet. They used pictures and references to Meisho Doto’s horse girl character from the game to get more people interested. In just two months, they turned a basic repair fund into a massive renovation budget worth eight figures. The dedication shown by this community rivals some of the most surprising incidents people have witnessed online recently. The Northern Lake crowdfunding campaign ultimately raised 125M yen (0.8M USD). The completion of the new stable has also been moved up to March or April, and the day when Meisho Doto and Neko Punch can move out of their rundown house is drawing near. Blessings to all supporters! pic.twitter.com/MeCd0U4PvX — たるまげ (@tarutaru_mage) December 22, 2025 Now that the farm has over 100 million yen, they can do much more than just basic fixes. They plan to buy and install treadmills for the horses. This equipment is important because it helps horses who need extra exercise, or those who can’t move around the pasture easily anymore, stay healthy and active. They’ll also replace all the fencing around the pastures, which is crucial for keeping the horses safe. The huge success of the campaign means the new stable will be finished much sooner than expected. The farm now thinks the stable will be ready by March or April 2025. This means Meisho Doto and his companion Neko Punch can move out of their current run-down home much earlier than planned. The farm was shocked by all the support they received. After the campaign closed on December 22, 2025, the Northern Lake X account posted a thank you message. They said they were grateful for all the generous support and warm messages, and promised to post a proper thank you soon. This fundraiser is part of a bigger trend caused by the Umamusume series. Since the game ended its four-year Japan-only run earlier this year, the real horses that inspired the characters have been getting more attention. Farms are seeing more tourists visiting, and people are donating tons of grass for the retired horses to eat. The passionate response from fans shows how online communities can make a real difference, much like how celebrities use their platforms to support causes they believe in.",2025-12-23T18:45:00+00:00,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/games/fans-of-this-gacha-game-just-raised-a-staggering-amount-of-money-for-a-run-down-farm-all-because-of-one-in-game-reference/,en,0.9016223549842834
"Valve just pulled the plug on Steam for certain Windows users, and if yours is affected, the clock is already ticking","Valve released an update on December 19 that officially made the Steam Windows client 64-bit only. The company stopped supporting the older 32-bit architecture earlier than it first planned. This change means time is running out for anyone still using the 32-bit version of Windows, even though the client still works for now. According to XDA Developers , this move was not a surprise. Valve announced back in September that it would only support the 64-bit version of Steam starting January 1, 2026. Releasing the final update before that date shows the company is serious about moving to modern architecture. If you are still running a 32-bit version of Windows, you can keep playing your Steam games right now. However, Valve is warning users not to rely on that old client. You should not keep using the 32-bit Steam client because it will stop getting important updates after January 1, 2026. Missing security updates puts your data at serious risk That deadline is very important because your client will not get any new features, security fixes, or bug patches after that date. Running an outdated client that handles purchases, logins, and personal information is dangerous. You will also not be able to get any technical support from Valve once the deadline passes. The company made it clear that the 32-bit Steam Windows client will not work forever and will eventually stop working completely. Steam quietly moves into a new phase on Windows, affecting some older PCs https://t.co/4ZfZ4ETbVl pic.twitter.com/frCTSC6JW9 — XDA (@xdadevelopers) December 22, 2025 If you are using Windows 11, you do not need to worry. Windows 11 only runs on 64-bit, so you are already using the updated Steam client and do not need to do anything. This is not the first time Valve has made controversial decisions that affect their hardware and software ecosystem. However, if you are still using Windows 10, you need to check your system right away. Windows 10 has both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If you are on the 32-bit version, you will have to upgrade to 64-bit if you want to keep getting new features and security fixes on Steam after January 1, 2026. Valve explained why they decided to drop support for the older architecture. They said some of the important system drivers and libraries needed to run core Steam features do not support the 32-bit version of Windows anymore. You cannot build modern, secure features if the basic foundation does not support them. Similar to how Microsoft has quietly changed features on user devices, tech companies are pushing users toward newer systems. The usage numbers also supported this decision. Valve reported that their Steam Hardware Survey showed only 0.01% of systems were still running the 32-bit version of Windows 10. When the user base is that small, it does not make sense to spend resources supporting it. While you can still play your games on your old machine today, you need to switch to 64-bit Windows before January 1, 2026 if you want the most secure Steam experience.",2025-12-23T18:30:00+00:00,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/games/valve-just-pulled-the-plug-on-steam-for-certain-windows-users-and-if-yours-is-affected-the-clock-is-already-ticking/,en,0.957622230052948
"Woman suing Miley Cyrus’s parents claims she’s the singer’s biological mom, her story involves celebrities you wouldn’t expect","The woman who says she is Miley Cyrus’s real mother is now speaking out, even though a court already dismissed her lawsuit. Jaymee Lee, who is 45 years old, previously sued Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus for fraud, breach of contract, and interfering with her parental rights. She claimed she was Miley’s biological mom, but Billy Ray has called these claims “absurd.” According to Page Six , Lee shared her story with the press about the allegations she made in the lawsuit. She said she grew up in Ruidoso, New Mexico, where she was sex trafficked by a local gang connected to a cartel when she was very young. Lee claimed she got pregnant at age 12 because of the trafficking. While pregnant, Lee said she tried to run away several times, including going to her grandparents’ house in Jamul, California. She wanted to protect her baby “at all costs.” “I specifically picked the name Miley as soon as I realized I was pregnant because of all the miles I had traveled [while being trafficked]. I wanted a name that was one of a kind that could be linked back to me, specifically,” she claimed. However, Miley’s actual birth name is Destiny Hope. Her story involves several major celebrities Before allegedly connecting with the Cyrus family, Lee claims she asked several famous people to adopt her unborn baby. She reportedly reached out to Julia Roberts, who had a ranch in New Mexico at the time. Lee also allegedly contacted Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne because of their connections to the state, and even Hillary Clinton, who was campaigning in the area. Lee said all the celebrities were kind to her, but none agreed to adopt the baby. Lee then claimed she turned to Dolly Parton, who is now Miley’s godmother. She said Parton connected her to Billy Ray Cyrus, who wanted to adopt a baby. In her dismissed lawsuit, Lee claimed she and Billy Ray agreed to an open adoption where she could be the child’s nanny and piano teacher.

Like other celebrities facing public criticism, the Oasis singer’s recent confrontation shows how stars handle uncomfortable situations. When she decided to sue the Cyruses, Lee claims she asked the Kardashian family for help finding a lawyer. She allegedly met them because they owned property next to her grandparents in Jamul. However, there is no record that the Kardashians ever owned property there. Celebrity interactions often make headlines, much like what a former prime minister said about Trudeau’s partner at a recent event. A woman (Jamie Lee) filed a lawsuit alleging she had recovered a memory of giving birth to Miley Cyrus at age 12, claiming she made a private adoption agreement with Billy Ray and Tish that was not honored (like being able to be around Miley) The court dismissed her crazy case. pic.twitter.com/ECw4J7Oiu1 — Miley Official (@MileyCyrusBz) December 10, 2025 Lee said she only recently remembered her trauma after moving back to Ruidoso triggered flashbacks. She checked herself into an Arizona mental health facility in 2016 and was diagnosed with PTSD. A doctor told her the brain can block out severe trauma, which is how she allegedly remembered being raped and having a baby. After allegedly remembering, Lee claims she reached out to Miley through lawyers but got no response. She also tried to report the trafficking to police but claims nobody took it seriously. Lee admits her story “does seem weird” but insists “the truth is crazy sometimes.” Despite a court already denying her request for a DNA test, Lee plans to file a new case in Malibu, California, where Miley lives, to seek a DNA test. Billy Ray was recently awarded $7,564.13 in legal fees, which Lee was ordered to pay last week.",2025-12-22T23:45:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/entertainment/woman-suing-miley-cyruss-parents-claims-shes-the-singers-biological-mom-her-story-involves-celebrities-you-wouldnt-expect/,en,0.7310036420822144
"Xbox players are reportedly losing access to decades of games overnight, and it’s not always their fault","Some Xbox users are losing access to their entire game libraries and linked Microsoft services like OneDrive and cloud storage. The worst part is that many of these players didn’t do anything wrong. When you buy a digital game, you don’t actually own it, and now players are seeing the real consequences of that. The impact of this problem is severe. According to Gaming Bible , industry insider Jez Corden has been investigating these reports for almost a year. He found that when Xbox bans an account for any reason, even by mistake or due to a technical error, the damage goes way beyond just losing gaming access. Players lose their entire Xbox account, which means decades of photos stored in OneDrive and important Office documents disappear too. Getting anything back from Microsoft after this happens is extremely rare. This is devastating for people who have trusted Microsoft’s system for years. Players are losing decades of gaming history and personal data Many Xbox accounts have been active since the Xbox 360 era. Players have built up hundreds of games and years of GamerScore and achievements. Losing all of that overnight is a nightmare scenario that’s actually happening to real people right now. You don’t even need to break any rules for this to happen. Account hacking is still very common in 2025. One player on X said they had their Microsoft account since Xbox 360 and spent thousands of dollars on games. After a hacker took over their account and changed the email, Microsoft told them they couldn’t recover it. Fifteen years of progress was gone forever. These shocking discoveries about tech companies continue to worry consumers about their digital safety. I've been investigating these reports for almost a year now. When you get banned on Xbox for whatever reason (even if it's not your fault), you can lose not only your Xbox account, but also decades of photos from OneDrive, Office docs, etc. It's rare to get anything back. https://t.co/kXXp0mWLrA — Jez (@JezCorden) December 19, 2025 This shows the main problem with giving up physical game discs. Digital purchases are convenient, but they’re not truly yours. Nobody can take a physical game disc from your shelf, but a technical error or wrong ban can erase your digital library instantly. Microsoft has been making other controversial moves lately, including quietly adding features to smart TVs without user consent. Users were shocked when they heard about this issue. The community reaction shows how worried people are about digital ownership. “yeah sorry but thats why i only buy physical on consoles since i think early last year. I realized its kind of stupid to buy many or expensive games that are locked to an account. For digital gog is actually amazing, very underrated more people should use it,” one user wrote.

"Sony just filed a patent to make every game family-friendly, and the bizarre AI technology it uses to replace slurs is absolutely wild","Sony just patented an incredibly ambitious AI censorship tool that could theoretically make every single video game, even the most adult AAA titles, completely family-friendly, as per GamingBible . Sony Interactive Entertainment filed the patent on December 9, and it reveals a powerful processor that can detect and access a game’s audio and video content. The goal is simple: to keep up with the evolving gaming tech landscape and use AI to provide tailored censorship for different users. While this technology is aimed squarely at the PlayStation 5 and upcoming PlayStation 6, the documents suggest Sony sees this being used across all major computer ecosystems. That means we could potentially see this kind of filtering on rival consoles, including Microsoft’s Xbox and even the Nintendo Switch hardware. This isn’t just about muting the occasional bad word. The AI system is designed to handle everything from blurring nudity and gore to completely muting slurs. What’s truly next-level, though, is the use of deepfake AI technology. Instead of just hiding content, the system can actually replace the censored audio or video, meaning you would hear or see something altogether different than what the original game intended. I think it’s a unique use of AI, even if generative AI has faced some serious criticism lately . This patent is clearly Sony’s way of ensuring every game is accessible to all ages The official patent description lays out the technical vision: “Artificial intelligence (AI) models are disclosed to customize audio video (AV) content, such as video game content, based on user-provided content filtering parameters.” This tool is designed to be fully automated and incredibly flexible. The system would implement a second processor specifically to obscure or replace the selected content based on your user profile. The flexibility is key here because users are able to set their own parameters at will. Upcoming major AAA releases could offer users the choice to filter out things like adult language, nudity, gore, alcohol use, and scenes of a sexual nature. If you’re a content creator or streamer, this could be massive. Having a built-in tool that automatically cleans up a game means you won’t have to worry about accidentally violating platform rules mid-stream. It also makes games viable for younger players. Sony Launches AI Censorship Tool, PS5, Xbox and Nintendo Consoles Targeted https://t.co/LiX28cOlh0 — GAMINGbible (@gamingbible) December 19, 2025 The AI will keep you informed, too. The patent reveals that players will be notified of upcoming content both before the game starts and while it is running. While this is happening, the AI will carry out the censorship based on your specific preferences. You then get to choose whether you want the AI to “remove the content” or simply “replace the content.” It’s genuinely hard to wrap my head around how this would work for a game that leans heavily into adult themes, like the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI . Trying to imagine a fully censored GTA is a challenge, but the fact that Sony is investing in this technology shows they are serious about creating highly customized player experiences. This newly acquired patent could radically change how we play games and what we see in them.",2025-12-22T23:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/gaming/sony-just-filed-a-patent-to-make-every-game-family-friendly-and-the-bizarre-ai-technology-it-uses-to-replace-slurs-is-absolutely-wild/,en,0.8936632871627808
"AI just cost ‘Clair Obscur’ its GOTY award, and the game that replaced it might have the same problem","The RPG game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has lost its two major awards after the Indie Game Awards found out the game used AI during development. The studio behind the game, Sandfall Interactive, had won both Game of the Year and Best Debut Game on December 18, but those wins have now been taken away. The IGA posted a video on Bluesky yesterday announcing that the game is now disqualified. This is a big problem for both the game’s reputation and the awards process. The main issue is that the IGA has a strict policy against generative AI. According to PC Gamer , Mike Towndrow from the IGA nomination committee said the organization talks about this throughout the year when looking at possible nominees and does not allow any games that use generative AI. However, the game that replaced Clair Obscur has also been accused of using AI. The developers gave conflicting statements about AI use What makes this situation worse is that the developers seemed to change their story. Towndrow said that Sandfall Interactive had originally agreed that no generative AI was used when they submitted the game. But on the day of the awards premiere, the studio admitted that generative AI was actually used in making the game. The timing of this admission was shocking. This is not the first time people questioned the game’s content. Just days after Clair Obscur came out in April, fans noticed textures that looked like they were made by AI. The developer quietly removed those textures and called them a placeholder texture in a patch note. AI technology has been rapidly advancing across different industries, with companies racing to integrate new AI capabilities into their products.

The controversy grew more intense, however, when it was claimed that Blue Prince also used AI in its production.

"Bill Clinton’s spokesperson claims ‘We’re in the first’ group who cut Epstein off, but the hot tub photo just blasted that denial to pieces","A spokesperson for the Justice Department just dropped a massive piece of news, claiming that the blacked-out person next to Bill Clinton in one of those widely circulated hot tub photos is actually a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse, as per CNN . This development immediately complicates the narrative coming from the former president’s team. Gates McGavick, the Justice Department spokesperson, confirmed the status of the redacted individual. McGavick posted the image directly to X, explaining that the black box was added specifically to protect a victim. McGavick wrote that the photo showed a “Beloved Democrat President,” adding, “The black box is added to protect a victim.” The identification of a victim in the photo directly conflicts with the defense put out by Clinton’s spokesperson, Angel Ureña. Ureña had released a statement earlier claiming that the former president not only did not know about Epstein’s horrific crimes but had also cut off his relationship with the convicted sex offender before those crimes even came to light. The former president is seemingly in hot water Ureña tried to draw a clear line in the sand regarding those who associated with Epstein. “There are two types of people here,” Ureña said. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.” If the person in the hot tub photo is indeed a victim, that statement looks incredibly shaky right now. The Justice Department is required to redact information that could identify victims who were sexually abused , thanks to the Epstein Files Transparency Act. This is why you see the black boxes in the first place. You should know, though, that it is not clear that every single redaction in every photo was made to protect a confirmed victim; for instance, an older man’s face was blacked out in some of the images. Despite this shocking new context surrounding the photo, it is crucial to remember that Clinton has never been accused of any wrongdoing by law enforcement, nor has he been charged with any crimes related to Epstein. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche supported this fact in a letter sent to Congress. Blanche stated that the Justice Department had conducted an extensive review of all the Epstein-related materials. Nearly naked Bill Clinton pictured soaking in hot tub with unidentified woman in Epstein files: ‘His reckoning.’ Read today's cover here: https://t.co/XqAHwTVION pic.twitter.com/lOVPuSa7tZ — New York Post (@nypost) December 20, 2025 That review, Blanche confirmed, did not “uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,” which would include Clinton. This means the DOJ hasn’t found anything in the just-released Epstein Files, which also has a picture of Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein , that would warrant opening an investigation into the former president. The Clinton spokesperson immediately fired back at the current administration following the photo’s circulation. The statement claimed that the Trump administration was “shielding themselves from what comes next.” It is important to note the political context surrounding the spokesperson who posted the image. Before Gates McGavick joined President Trump’s administration this year, he worked for the Republican National Committee and several Republican lawmakers. When other outlets asked the Justice Department specifically about McGavick’s post on X, the Department declined to provide any comment. This leaves us with a high-profile claim from a politically affiliated spokesperson that seems to undermine the former president’s defense, but without official confirmation from the wider DOJ.",2025-12-22T23:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/bill-clintons-spokesperson-claims-were-in-the-first-group-who-cut-epstein-off-but-the-hot-tub-photo-just-blasted-that-denial-to-pieces/,en,0.888332724571228
"Careful! Some card readers are trying to scam people, and this Walmart shopper almost paid $90 than needed at checkout","A Walmart shopper has gone viral after posting a warning to others about a shocking price jump that nearly added $90 to her bill at checkout. The incident highlights why shoppers should always double-check the total on the payment screen, especially when using self-checkout lanes during busy shopping hours. According to Daily Dot , the shopper, who goes by the username @nobrasallowed on TikTok , shared the experience from a recent trip to Walmart. According to her video, everything seemed normal at first. After scanning her items, the self-checkout screen showed a total of $108, which matched what she expected to pay. However, things changed the moment she inserted her card to complete the purchase. Instead of the $108 total, the card reader suddenly displayed a charge of $193. Realizing something was wrong, she quickly removed her card before the payment could go through. This suspicious pricing error raises serious questions about checkout accuracy She then called over a Walmart employee for help. The worker moved the transaction to a different register and re-rang the items. This time, the total correctly came out to $108, confirming that the higher amount was an error. The shopper said the issue was resolved, but she shared the video to warn others to stay alert and never assume the checkout total is correct without checking it carefully. The shopper didn’t complete the $193 payment, so she’s not sure if the machine would have charged her the extra $90. Still, she thought the error was very strange and wanted to warn other shoppers. She told people to be careful and pay extra attention when shopping. @nobrasallowed Walmart felt a little fishy today. Maybe just a glitch.

This isn’t the first time Walmart shoppers have raised concerns about store practices . Many people responded to her post and said they’ve seen similar problems. Some shoppers shared other checkout errors they’ve noticed and worried about how many mistakes they might have missed over time. Another shopper described a weird problem they saw twice in one week. After scanning an item, the system automatically added the next size up of that product along with the one they actually scanned. This meant they were charged for two items when they only picked up one. They said the receipt showed an employee had to manually remove the extra item, and they believed it felt intentional.

"SF blackout turns into total chaos as Waymo self-driving cars stall mid-intersection, what the company has to say about it is more bizarre","San Francisco was plunged into darkness over the weekend due to a massive power outage, but the real drama started when the city’s fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis went totally haywire. The citywide outage forced the autonomous ride-hailing service to halt operations immediately, leaving vehicles stranded right in the middle of streets and busy intersections, as reported by TMZ . This is a nightmare scenario for AVs, and it immediately sparked public concern about how these vehicles handle infrastructure failures. Pedestrians caught the whole thing on video, showing just how bad the gridlock got. In the busy North Beach neighborhood, at least four Waymo vehicles were seen parked dead center in a major intersection. They had their hazards flashing, but they were causing a massive traffic jam that brought human drivers to a standstill. The company had to shut down the system around 8:00 PM. The reason for the shutdown is pretty critical: the cars simply can’t operate safely when there aren’t functioning traffic signals. If the car relies entirely on external signals to know when to move, any widespread power failure means the car becomes a very expensive, very immobile roadblock. It’s another public embarrassment for Waymo As the chaos unfolded, a Waymo spokesperson confirmed that ride-hailing services were “temporarily suspended” because of the outage. The company stated their teams were working “diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability,” adding that they hoped to get services back online soon. The power problems weren’t fixed quickly, either. Thousands of San Franciscans were still without electricity on Sunday morning as utility crews worked to restore power after the nearly day-long outage. After the initial confusion subsided, Waymo confirmed that they were resuming ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area. This is where the company’s follow-up statement gets particularly interesting, because it sounds like they’re trying to shift the focus away from the fact that their cars stalled completely. Zombie apocalypse Waymo Cars extremely Dangerously Halted ALL traffic During San Francisco Power Outage https://t.co/XAeUMZ2XXG — GNews ( Vegan ) (@GNews_Vegan) December 22, 2025 A spokesperson acknowledged that the power outage was a “widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions.” They admitted that the failure of utility infrastructure was significant. However, the spokesperson then pivoted to focus on their own technology’s future capabilities, claiming the company is “committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.” I think that statement is a little bizarre. If the cars had adjusted to traffic flow, they wouldn’t have stalled and blocked intersections in the first place. While that’s arguably better than driving through an active police standoff , stalling in the middle of a busy street is the opposite of adjusting to traffic flow. If a major city loses all its traffic signals, you need autonomous vehicles that can safely pull over to the side of the road or navigate based on human-like decision-making. This incident highlights a major vulnerability in self-driving tech. If a car becomes a hazard the moment basic city infrastructure fails, or drives past school buses that have their stop arms extended , that’s a huge problem for widespread adoption. Waymo finished its statement by saying they are “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.” If they truly want to maintain that trust, they’re going to have to prove that their next generation of software can handle a total blackout without turning into a total mess.",2025-12-22T22:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/auto/sf-blackout-turns-into-total-chaos-as-waymo-self-driving-cars-stall-mid-intersection-what-the-company-has-to-say-about-it-is-more-bizarre/,en,0.9812865853309631
"Pierce Brosnan refuses to answer simple question about James Bond, says one predecessor reacted the exact same way","Pierce Brosnan made it clear he’s completely done talking about James Bond. The actor shut down a question about whether the spy would enjoy Christmas with a strong refusal. Brosnan played 007 in four movies and was answering questions when a journalist asked if Bond would celebrate the holidays. According to Entertainment Weekly , Brosnan quickly replied that Bond would obviously enjoy Christmas. But when the interviewer asked if Bond’s tough personality would make him skip the holidays, Brosnan stopped the conversation. He said he didn’t want to answer and wouldn’t answer the question. He then gave a very honest response showing how tired he is of Bond topics. “I don’t really want to answer the question, and I’m not going to answer the question,” he said. “Because I couldn’t give a f—! Why would I waste my time thinking about where James Bond would be at Christmas?”He apologized to the journalist but said these questions will continue forever. One Bond actor before him felt exactly the same way Brosnan isn’t the only Bond actor frustrated with endless questions about the character. He mentioned that Sean Connery, who played Bond before him, felt the same way after leaving the role. Brosnan remembered Connery’s reaction was to tell people to never ask about it again. It seems this frustration comes with the job once you stop playing Bond. Instead of discussing Bond’s plans, Brosnan talked about his own Christmas. He said he knows exactly where Pierce Brosnan will be spending the holiday – at home with his wife in their island retreat in Hawaii. That sounds much better than fighting villains in a tuxedo. Pierce Brosnan when asked if James Bond would enjoy Christmas: “I don't really want to answer the question, and I'm not going to answer the question. Because I couldn't give a fuck.

He also praised the other Bond actors, saying he loved Connery and Roger Moore, and that Daniel Craig and Tim Dalton were both amazing. Brosnan might even return to the franchise in a different role. Last August, he said he would definitely consider an offer if director Denis Villeneuve was involved in the next film.

"‘I’m a bad, bad daddy!’: This bizarre bear owner keeps his massive pet from hibernating using one ridiculous trick","Bear owner Jeff “the Bear Man” Watson has revealed his ridiculous secret for keeping his massive pets from hibernating during the winter months. While most animals that sleep through the cold season do so out of necessity, Watson, who has gained over 4.4 million views on TikTok, claims his brown and black bears simply do not need the long nap. You might be wondering how he convinces a giant bear to stay awake when the weather gets chilly. His joking answer is truly priceless. “I’ll tell you why,” Watson said in his video , which TikTok won’t let us show here, but you can see it on TikTok if you follow the link. “’Cause I look at him and go, ‘You can’t go to sleep! You cannot hibernate! ‘Cause I’m a bad, bad daddy!’” While that’s a hilarious image, the actual mechanism is much simpler, and it completely changes how we think about bears. Watson explains that in the wild, brown and black bears in North America are primarily vegetarian animals. When winter hits, their natural food sources like berries, nuts, and grasses disappear, which is what forces them to go into hibernation. They slow their heart rate and respiration down, living off the fat reserves they built up during the warmer months until spring arrives. This sounds like a wild claim, but the science actually backs him up Since Watson provides his bears with abundant food all year round, they never hit that crisis point where their food supply vanishes. He notes that the bears simply do not have a biological need to go to sleep. “He’s got a bear daddy who gives him his food,” Watson concluded. “It’s not necessary if food’s available.” And the whole thing is backed by science, and it’s not outlandish like the story of the Cocaine Bear . It’s easy to think of bears as terrifying, meat-eating predators, but they are technically omnivores whose diets skew heavily toward vegetarianism. They consume a huge variety of seeds, fruits, roots, and grass when available. They will certainly eat small mammals or fish if they can, but their main calorie sources come from plants. This means that if you keep those plant-based calories coming, you can expect the bears to stay active. This behavior even occurs in the wild when the conditions are right. For instance, places with warmer climates sometimes see bears skip hibernation altogether, or they might only sleep for a much shorter period than bears in freezing environments. Commenters on Watson’s video pointed this out, citing that bears in North Carolina sometimes only hibernate for about a month because the climate is too warm. Other users mentioned Kodiak Island, where the bears often skip hibernation because their food is plentiful year-round. Of course, for many viewers, the science was secondary to the sheer shock of the situation. While some states allow people to keep bears with a permit, it is certainly an unorthodox choice. Many users ignored the discussion of hibernation entirely and instead focused on the bizarre reality of having a massive brown bear as a pet. “Other people out here just living my dreams,” one commenter wrote. Another joked, “I KNEW they could be pet, I KNEW it.” It’s definitely a strange situation, but if you’re going to keep a bear, it’s nice to know you can keep the fun going without waiting for them to wake up in the spring. The same goes for pet turtles, especially if you are one of those forcing them into brumation .",2025-12-22T22:00:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/im-a-bad-bad-daddy-this-bizarre-bear-owner-keeps-his-massive-pet-from-hibernating-using-one-ridiculous-trick/,en,0.8854709267616272
"A fan spotted a former Nickelodeon actor on the streets and started recording, now the internet is divided on what happened next","Tylor Chase, who played Martin Qwerly on Nickelodeon’s Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide , was recently seen living homeless on the streets of Riverside, California. A video showing the 36-year-old actor went viral back in September, leaving fans shocked and concerned. In the clip, Chase looked extremely disheveled when a fan approached him with a camera. The person filming mistakenly asked if he was on Disney Channel, but Chase corrected them and said he was on Nickelodeon. He confirmed his role on Ned’s Declassified , which aired from 2004 to 2007. After the video spread online, fans immediately tried to help by launching a GoFundMe page. The fundraiser raised over $1,200, but it was shut down almost right away by Chase’s mother. His mother revealed that Tylor desperately needs medical attention, but he refuses to accept it. She explained that giving him money wouldn’t actually help his situation. According to her, Chase can’t manage money for his medications by himself, and he loses phones within a day or two of receiving them. Chase’s mother explains why he needs medical help, not money The viral footage caused a major split among viewers online. Many fans expressed sadness, with some calling the Hollywood industry “sick” for letting this happen. However, others criticized the person who filmed Chase during such a difficult moment in his life. This isn’t the first time California has seen viral moments involving public incidents, like when a Waymo robotaxi experienced a meltdown . One viewer on X wrote, “Hey, so instead of filming him for a video, maybe ask how you can help him or just do anything other than this.” “The help might come from someone watching this video. How many people would know if this video was not circulating? This might be the best thing she can do so that he can receive the attention he needs,” another argued.

Woman orders steak at Capital Grille and the server decides she belongs at the kids’ table after hearing one shocking request,"A woman attending her company’s annual holiday luncheon at Capital Grille in North Raleigh, N.C., got an unexpected surprise when her server joked about her order by bringing her a Disney Frozen coloring book, according to BroBible . That’s right, Danielle Boncella, who shared the story on her TikTok account @daniellaboncella, sparked a massive online debate about steak etiquette after she asked for a side of ketchup with her medium-well steak. Boncella recounted the whole awkward situation in a video that has already racked up more than 8,000 views. She’s pretty clear about her culinary preferences, even if they aren’t exactly traditional fine dining fare. “One thing about me, your girl loves a steak,” she said, adding that she likes it medium-well and “dipped in ketchup,” too. When she placed the order at the upscale restaurant, her request for ketchup immediately drew laughter from both her co-workers and the waitstaff. She recalled the server making fun of her, rolling her eyes as she said he suggested she “should probably sit at the kids’ table.” The joke didn’t end there, though, and what happened next was truly hilarious The server came back a little bit later and presented her with a plastic-wrapped, Frozen -themed coloring book. Boncella was laughing in disbelief as she held it up, explaining that he told her she needed the book for the kids’ table in case she got bored and wanted to color. I’m not going to lie, ordering ketchup for a steak at a nice spot like Capital Grille is definitely controversial, and you can see why the server reacted the way he did. Despite the teasing and the coloring book delivery, Boncella took the joke incredibly well. She insisted in the video caption that she’s just “a little kid trapped inside a 31 yr old body.” She also later confirmed that she wasn’t offended at all, calling the whole ordeal the “best dining experience” she’d had “in a long time.” Of course, it is much better than some snooping Michelin-starred restaurants for sure. She loved the entertainment, even if she was “the butt of the joke.” @daniellaboncella I promise I’m just a little kid trapped inside a 31 yr old body. If you’re ever in North Raleigh, Capital Grille is a must #raleigh #northcarolina #storytime #imjustagirl #singlemom ♬ original sound – Danielle Viewers were totally divided on whether the server went too far with his playful jabs. Many people defended Boncella’s right to eat her food exactly how she likes it, and I agree with them. It’s your steak, after all. One commenter wrote that people need to mind their own business, adding, “it’s your steak, they’re not eating it haha furthermore who doesn’t use ketchup lol.” Another user championed her preferences, saying, “Stand firm for what you want. You have every right. Nobody should be judging you.” Other viewers praised the server’s cleverness and Boncella’s good sense of humor. One person loved the commitment to the bit, writing, “I love this!! Color pack brought out to complete the joke. My kind of people.” Just like how the internet reacted to Joe Jonas’ reaction to his own public grilling , a commenter was glad Boncella wasn’t uptight, saying, “Glad to see you have a sense of humor. Most folks are so uptight these days.” Boncella made it clear that she didn’t mind the joke one bit, and she stressed that if you’re ever in North Raleigh, “Capital Grille is a must.”",2025-12-22T21:30:00+00:00,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/social-media/woman-orders-steak-at-capital-grille-and-the-server-decides-she-belongs-at-the-kids-table-after-hearing-one-shocking-request/,en,0.8853583335876465
"Santa and his elves just made the naughty list, as camera catches them filling carts at Montreal grocery store, but they weren’t shopping","A group of people dressed as Santa and masked elves were caught on camera filling up several grocery carts at a Montreal store on Monday night. They left the building without paying for any of the food. Montreal police are now investigating the incident as a shoplifting case. According to the CBC , the event happened around 9:15 PM on Monday on Laurier Avenue, near Chambord Street. Police spokesperson Caroline Chèvrefils confirmed that several masked and disguised people were involved. They left the store with the stolen food. An activist group called Robins des ruelles, which means Robins of the Alleys, took responsibility for the theft on social media. The group called it a “great food drive” and a political protest. They said the stolen food was worth about $3,000. The group defended their actions with a controversial statement The activists explained why they stole the food. They said supermarket chains are using inflation as an excuse to raise prices while making record profits. Meanwhile, regular people are struggling to afford basic groceries. A statement on their Instagram page was direct about their message. “A handful of corporations are holding our basic needs hostage,” it said. “For us, that’s theft, and they are the real criminals.” The group didn’t keep the stolen food for themselves. They gave it away under a Christmas tree at place Valois in Montreal’s Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve area. Any leftover food went to community fridges around the city. This kind of vigilante action isn’t new, as we’ve seen people step in to stop criminals in unexpected ways before. Report: A group of people 40 individuals dressed as Santas and masked elves robbed a Metro grocery store in Montreal’s Plateau-Mont-Royal neighborhood to protest rising food costs. They filled carts and bags with roughly $3,000 worth of groceries before leaving without paying. pic.twitter.com/eop2g8Zqzf — The Calvin Coolidge Project (@TheCalvinCooli1) December 22, 2025 The timing of this protest makes sense when you look at recent food price data. Statistics Canada’s Consumer Price Index for November showed that grocery inflation reached its highest rate in almost two years. While overall inflation was 2.2 percent, food prices jumped 4.7 percent compared to last year. Food costs have been rising faster than general inflation since August 2024. Public reaction on social media has been mostly positive, showing how frustrated people are with high grocery prices. However, Metro, the store that was robbed, strongly condemned the stunt. Spokesperson Geneviève Grégoire said theft is always unacceptable and is a criminal act, no matter the reason. Public safety concerns remain important, just like when strangers send warning signals to protect each other. Marc-André Cyr, a political science lecturer at Université du Québec à Montréal, noted the huge gap between institutions calling this a crime and the public seeing it as acceptable. He believes this action works because it forces people to talk about poverty, inflation, and grocery store profits. Police are reviewing videos of the incident, but no arrests have been made yet.",2025-12-22T21:15:00+00:00,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/true-crime/santa-and-his-elves-just-made-the-naughty-list-as-camera-catches-them-filling-carts-at-montreal-grocery-store-but-they-werent-shopping/,en,0.983223021030426
"VP Vance takes a bizarre dig at Jasmine Crockett’s nails and ‘street girl persona,’ but her brutal clapback instantly destroys him","Representative Jasmine Crockett absolutely demolished Vice President Vance after he took a bizarre and personal dig at her “street girl persona” and her appearance, as per The Hill . Vance launched the insult during a speech at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, prompting a brutal clapback from the Texas Democrat that instantly shifted the conversation to the most sensitive topic in Republican politics. Vance specifically targeted Crockett while rattling off a list of Democratic candidates he seemed to deem unimpressive. After receiving boos from the audience simply by mentioning her name, the vice president doubled down on the personal attack. “And Jasmine Crockett. Oh, Jasmine Crockett,” Vance said. “The record speaks for itself. She wants to be a senator, though her street girl persona is about as real as her nails.” Honestly, Vance walked right into this one, giving Crockett the perfect opening for a political counterpunch. She didn’t wait long, posting a response on X that immediately referenced President Trump’s high-pressure campaign against his first-term vice president, Mike Pence, following the 2020 election. Crockett reminded everyone that Vance secured his current position because his boss incited a violent mob to target his predecessor She directly questioned Vance’s priorities, focusing on the dark events of January 6, 2021, “Imagine commenting on someone’s nails while at the same time ignoring that the only reason you got your political ‘dream’ job was because your boss incited a violent mob who wanted to hang your predecessor for, oh I don’t know, honoring his oath to the Constitution?!” She was referring to the mob of President Trump supporters who famously erected a gallows and chanted “Hang Mike Pence” outside the Capitol. Crockett, who recently launched her own Senate bid in Texas, didn’t stop there. She urged Vance to focus on real issues instead of her nails. She challenged him to save the political mudslinging for the Senate floor, demanding that he work to stop his boss from “bankrupting our country while engaging in the largest corruption scheme we’ve ever seen?!” JUST IN: Jasmine Crockett is fuming over VP Vance saying that she has a ""street-girl persona.""

His overall message was urging conservatives to unite against the left rather than getting distracted by internal party feuds, even calling out Nick Fuentes for his wild statement against his wife, Usha Vance . Crockett’s entry into the Texas Senate race has actually been welcomed by the Republicans locked in their own fierce primary battle, which is an interesting wrinkle in the story. She is currently leading the Democratic primary field, according to a poll released last week, holding an 8 percentage point lead over state Representative James Talarico. The Texas representative has also made it clear that she is willing to cross party lines to gain support, announcing last week that voters in the red state who regret voting for President Trump are welcome to join her campaign.

‘My worst nightmare’: Mother speaks out after two teens allegedly killed her 14-year-old daughter in a crime so brutal they’re being tried as adults,"Two Florida boys will be tried as adults for killing 14-year-old Danika Troy. The boys, 16-year-old Gabriel Williams and 14-year-old Kimahri Blevins, are accused of shooting her multiple times and setting her body on fire. The murder happened near Pensacola in Pace, Florida, on November 30. According to the NY Post , the State Attorney’s Office announced on Friday that both teens were indicted on first-degree premeditated murder charges. Police say the boys lured Troy to a walking path where they shot her and then burned her body. Troy’s mother reported her missing the next morning, and someone found her badly burned remains on December 2 around 11:00 AM. The victim was identified only by her shoes and electric scooter, which she had ridden to meet the boys. The Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office arrested both suspects within days. They were first held at a juvenile detention center but were moved to the Santa Rosa County Jail without bond after the indictment. The motive behind this crime remains a complete mystery to investigators Sheriff Bob Johnson said the evidence pointed to the boys right away, which led to their quick arrest. He expressed shock at the violence, saying it’s bad enough to kill a 14-year-old, but shooting her multiple times and then setting her on fire is even worse. Police believe the attack was planned after the three teens had a disagreement on social media in November. Troy had allegedly called Williams worthless and a gang member. However, the sheriff said the motive they received “doesn’t fit the forensics or any facts of the case.” UPDATE: Florida “teens” accused of luring a 14-year-old girl into the woods before k*lling her and setting her body on fire will be tried as adults Gabriel Williams, 16, and Kimahri Blevins, 14, allegedly plotted to k*ll Danika Troy after one of them said his “feelings were… pic.twitter.com/Eumq51Lxpc — Unlimited L's (@unlimited_ls) December 22, 2025 This suggests there’s more to the story that hasn’t been discovered yet.

One of them allegedly pretended to have romantic feelings for Danika to trick her into meeting them. Ashley told reporters that Williams pretended to have feelings for her daughter, which is how she was lured to the walking path.

NBA Jam Deluxe Arcade1Up Cabinet Drops to All-Time Low Price,"NBA Jam is a 90s sports game that still hits just as hard today . Unless you grew up with the game, it may sound like a bit of a niche sports entry, which it absolutely was when it started out. However, it exploded to mainstream popularity very quickly, earning over $1 billion in its first year. Today, you can relive that glory by snagging the NBA Deluxe Arcade Cabinet from Arcade1Up. It’s currently $100 off on Amazon, and a whopping $150 off on Best Buy . In case you’re unfamiliar, Arcade1Up recreates 3/4 scales of home arcade cabinets for classic retro games. The company has an official license to do so, so you know the overall experience is authentic. They also have recreations of Pac-Man , Street Fighter , and Mortal Kombat . Needless to say, these make for really cool gifts for that gamer in your life who loves niche, nostalgic, and retro games. A Faithful Recreation Of Three Iconic NBA Games Something important to note here is that the “Deluxe” designation in this arcade cabinet isn’t just marketing lingo. Earlier Arcade1Up models required separate risers to reach a comfortable standing height, but this one has a single-body construction that’s approximately 5 feet tall. This gets very close to the authentic silhouette of a ’90s Midway cabinet. The cabinet also features a bright, crisp, 17-inch color screen. It captures the “On Fire!” moments and high-flying dunk chaos beautifully. You also get a gigantic NBA logo on the side, decent quality dual speakers, controls for two players, and neon lights throughout the body. Interestingly, it also features online multiplayer, meaning you can play against the few who also own a similar cabinet. The cabinet doesn’t just feature NBA Jam; it also includes NBA Jam Tournament Edition and NBA Hang Time . Many will be familiar with the first two, but not necessarily with Hang Time . This one had better gameplay, the class of ‘96 (Kobe, Iverson, Stephon Marbury), and tighter controls. It also captures the 90s boom-bap hip-hop era with its soundtrack. If you’ve never played the game, Arcade1Up’s deluxe cabinet is a truly premium way to experience it for the first time.",2025-12-24T20:00:00+00:00,Burair Noor,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/nba-jam-deluxe-arcade1up-cabinet-drops-to-all-time-low-price/,en,0.5462422370910645
Forza Horizon 6 Car Wishlist: The Vehicles We Want,"Let’s be real — going into 2026, the majority of the audience is hyped for just two upcoming bangers: Grand Theft Auto VI and Forza Horizon 6. This is because both are released once in a generation, capable of reshaping the entire gaming industry. While GTA VI caters to a different crowd, Forza Horizon 6 is for us — people who live for the sports and car culture. Today, the spotlight is on the major selling point of this franchise: the never-ending car list. No doubt that the next entry will feature absolute fan favorites; however, there are some must-adds that we can’t wait to floor across the stunning Japanese highways. So, without further ado, here’s our Forza Horizon 6 car wishlist. Forza Horizon 6 Car Wishlist The Holy Grails Image: Playground Games These automotive legends have been sitting in the community’s wishlist for quite a while now. Forza Horizon 6 is set in Japan, and the timeless aura that these cars have is only going to make them shine brighter in a Tokyo-like atmosphere. Here’s what we want in the next entry. Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren : Arguably the most requested car, this unicorn has been missing from the franchise for years. Hopefully, the licensing issues are resolved so fans can finally get a chance to drive it, once again. Bugatti Bolide: The Divo and Chiron have been the go-to speedtrap-breakers for many. However, getting behind the wheel of a track-focused Bugatti Bolide would be a treat for the enthusiasts. Ferrari Daytona SP3 : This monster came out in 2022, but still failed to appear in Forza Horizon 5. But in the Japanese urban setting, the cyberpunk-ish Daytona SP3 is only going to make the scene prettier. Toyota GR GT: This car is all over the car community. With a promising reveal and a planned 2027 global release, we expect it later in the game. Gazoo Racing (GR) is known for its automotive wonders, which makes the twin-turbo V8 Toyota GR GT a worthy candidate for the new Horizon car roster. The JDM Legends Image: Playground Games While Forza Horizon 5 featured loads of JDM legends , we have high hopes for its successor. As the game is now based in Japan, from Kei cars to icons, we want everything. The following JDM vehicles made it to our wishlist. Lexus IS300/ Toyota Altezza: We’ve got the LFA, SC300, and even the MK4, but the Altezza, a.k.a the JDM version of the IS 300, remains absent from the Horizon franchise. Hope it’s featured in the next game so enthusiasts can have a fun, 4-door Japanese legend to drift with. Toyota Century (V12): There’s no better game than Forza Horizon 6 to add the glorious Toyota Century V12. The car is a symbol of authority and was used by Japan’s CEOs and even the Prime Ministers at some point. We can’t wait for it to make an appearance. Suzuki Alto Works: Kei cars are the most significant part of the Japanese car culture. While the game is set to feature plenty, the underrated Suzuki Alto Works deserves a feature. Being a perfect combination of light weight and power, Ford Fiesta drivers will finally get a worthy replacement. Suzuki Cappuccino: Following the Alto Works, the Cappuccino is another must-add Kei car. Since the Forza Horizon 5 AZ-1 debut, the demand for this car has gone even higher, and the fans are looking forward to seeing it in the next entry. Everyday Heroes Image: Playground Games Sometimes players fire up the Horizon games just to chill and cruise around with their favorite music in the background. To make this experience as relatable as possible, Playground Games should add some daily drivers to the game. Toyota Prius: Instead of just the modern-day Prius, we want to play with various generations. This includes the famous second-gen that we still see on the streets almost every day. Honda Odyssey: Last appeared in Forza Motorsport 7, this famous “soccer mom” vanguard remains absent from the franchise. Honda Odyssey making a comeback in the Japanese setting would be lovely. Toyota RAV4: This would be one of the most appreciated additions, as the RAV4 hasn’t been to a Horizon festival since the original Forza Horizon. With that, our wishlist comes to an end. Currently, there are no confirmations or even leaks supporting the appearance of these cars in Forza Horizon 6. However, being a franchise known for its extensive car roster, odds are high that these might get featured in the next best Horizon game.",2025-12-24T19:30:00+00:00,Shahmeer Shahzad,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/forza-horizon-6-car-wishlist-the-vehicles-we-want/,it,0.44053027033805847
The Football Manager 26 Stadium Pack Mod Has Been Released,"Football Manager 26 is a game that relies on the community almost as much as it relies on the developers. Popular community mod creator BassyBoy has been working on a Stadium Megapack for months now, and the full release is finally out today. The pack features 120 stadiums from top European leagues, and even a couple from South America. BassyBoy also added a custom crowd-made system, while also adding some clever optimizations for performance. Despite being an intensive community-made mod, it runs incredibly well, even on older stadiums. In the short time since the mod has been out, there haven’t been any reports of game-breaking bugs, corrupt saves, or crashes either. Not a bad start. You can download the Stadium Megapack Mod from BassBoy ’s website. What To Expect From The Stadium Megapack This project is nothing short of a “mammoth effort,” as the creator himself describes. BassyBoy is also responsible for a realistic newgen faces pack, which fixes some of the uncanny character models in FM 26 . Here is the full breakdown of what is included in the initial V1 release: A roster of 120 stadiums that focus on the top 5 European leagues. There are also stadiums from Portugal, the Netherlands, and Turkey. The pack also features several iconic Argentinian and Brazilian grounds, including the Legia Warsaw stadium. The mod uses a unique “Crowd Inject” system. Unlike the base game, it uses real-time attendance data from your save. For example, if you have a 50,000-seat stadium but only 20,000 fans show up, the stands will realistically show empty seats. For players on lower-end systems, there are plenty of quality settings in the config files to ensure smooth performance. You do not need to start a new career. The mod is fully compatible with existing FM26 saves. Even saves from FM23 and FM24 can carry over. However, it should be noted that the mod itself isn’t compatible with any past Football Manager titles, just FM26 . While the mod is a breakthrough for the Unity-based FM26 engine, there are a few compatibility hurdles to keep in mind. BassyBoy has confirmed that the mod will not work on MacBooks with Apple Silicon at this time, and support for the Steam Deck is currently considered experimental.",2025-12-24T19:00:00+00:00,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/the-football-manager-26-stadium-pack-mod-has-been-released/,en,0.8288820385932922
NASCAR 25 Update Coming in January - Here's What to Expect,"iRacing has confirmed that new updates for NASCAR 25 are planned for January, as teams return from the usual Christmas and New Year downtime and shift their focus back to releasing new content. The update will add Portland International Raceway as a free addition on all platforms, making the track available in Quick Race and Online modes for the NASCAR Xfinity Series. Sonoma Raceway is also set to receive a full refresh, featuring updated racing surfaces and artwork built on iRacing’s recent ground-up rebuild of the circuit. Online multiplayer is getting some attention as well, with expanded car customization options planned based on player feedback. These changes will give players more freedom when setting up their online cars, including the option to select any car number they want. The team released the December DLC pack for NASCAR 25 a couple of weeks ago , adding 13 patriotic paint schemes across the top three NASCAR national series. The pack features designs for Chase Elliott, Ross Chastain, Brad Keselowski, Christopher Bell and several others. Altogether, the DLC includes 121 paint schemes and 32 fire suits that can be used throughout the NASCAR Cup Series, Xfinity Series, Craftsman Truck Series and the ARCA Menards Series.",2025-12-24T01:47:25+00:00,Steve Noah,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/nascar-25-update-coming-in-january-heres-what-to-expect/,en,0.9565175175666809
How to Get Super Wheelspins in Forza Horizon 5,"In the vast world of Forza Horizon 5 , Super Wheelspins are the undisputed bread and butter of progression. Many players focus on building a garage of the fastest cars , and Super Wheelspins are a great way of getting closer to that. Unlike a standard spin, a Super Wheelspin grants you three rewards at once, drastically increasing your odds of hitting the jackpot. You can win rare cars, large credit payouts, and even exclusive cosmetics. Now, you get normal Wheelspins for levelling up, completing accolades, and advancing through the story. However, Super Wheelspins are a bit rarer and are obtained by spending Skill Points on certain cars’ Car Mastery Trees. The way to farm hundreds of Super Wheelspins is a straightforward one: first, gain large amounts of Skill Points, and then, buy cost-efficient cars and redeem their Car Mastery perks. The Art Of Skill Point Farming The most essential part of getting Super Wheelspins is farming a stockpile of Skill Points (SP). These are earned by performing skill chains during normal gameplay, but for efficient farming, you need a high-multiplier car and a good location to farm at. You earn 1 Skill Point for every 50,000 Skill Score you bank. To be efficient, reach a 500,000 score as fast as possible for 10 SP. 1. The High-Multiplier Hoonigan Drift: Use a car that is famous for its high skill multiplier, preferably the Hoonigan Ford RS200 Evolution or the Hoonigan Hunicorn V1, as both can reach a 7x skill chain multiplier. Head towards the vast airfield and consistently drift up and down the runway, smashing fences, and using the massive area to build a huge chain. Again, the necessary part is that you bank your skill chain once you hit a score of 500,000 to earn the maximum 10 Skill Points per chain. If you choose to bank any higher than that, you will waste your time and score. 2. The 18-second Event Lab Blueprint For anyone looking for a semi-automated farming method, consider using the Event Lab. What you want to do is go to Event Blueprints and search for the title “18s”. With this search, you’ll be able to find user-created events to bank the 500,000 skill score immediately. If you’re looking for recommendations for what car to use, then go with the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento Forza Edition. Once you’ve done the above steps, just start the event and set the driving presets to ultimate. Make sure steering is set to Auto Steering and shifting is automatic. 3. The Peel Trident Now, for players with low credit scores, the best care to use is the Peel Trident. Anyone can get this car easily, and this is why this method is the cheapest and most skill-point efficient way to convert Skill Points into Super Wheelspins. The Peel Trident costs a mere 25,000 Credits in the Auto Show. The Trident’s Car Mastery offers a Super Wheelspin for a total cost of just 9 skill points. This way is the best value for new players or for anyone looking to maximise their Super Wheelspin acquisition, while also minimising credit spending. It’s really simple: just buy the car, redeem the mastery, then just discard or sell the car to get your credits back. Bulk Farming For High Rollers For players who have plenty of credits saved up, you can easily speed up the farming process by using cars that yield multiple Super Wheelspins at once. The most reliable choice for this would be the Porsche 918 Spider. This is a solid, cost-effective option for bulk farming. The car costs approximately 196,000 credits in the Auction House, and its Car Mastery costs 26 Skill Points and provides one of each Wheelspin. Now that the mid-range option is out of the way, here’s the fastest option. You can use either the Zenvo TSR-S or the Bugatti D.Va. These options are to be considered where credits are no object, and you’re looking for the fastest farming. The Zenvo costs 1.2 million Credits from the Car Collection. Its mastery costs 21 Skill Points and grants two Super Wheelspins along with one regular wheelspin. The Bugatti costs around 500,000 Credits and costs 21 Skill Points to unlock two Super Wheespins, one regular Wheelspin, and 50,000 Credits. These options are the most expensive, but are also the most time-efficient ones for players who have no problem with spending a high amount of credits.",2025-12-23T22:00:00+00:00,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/how-to-get-super-wheelspins-in-forza-horizon-5/,en,0.6569929122924805
Has Wreckreation Improved? A Look at the Game After Recent Updates,"Games like Wreckreation are hard to come by. You won’t often hear about a sandbox racing game that allows players to build their own tracks to race. And that’s why the direction in which the game is heading is disappointing. However, Three Fields Entertainment haven’t given up yet. Wreckreation has recently received its third major content update , and things may start looking up. After publishers pulled funding for the game, Three Fields Entertainment set up a Patreon to support future updates. While not at its max potential, the updates have still been positive overall. Let’s take a look at the state of the game following the mid-December update and what the foreseeable future holds. Breaking Down Wreckreation’s Mid-December Update Image: Three Fields Entertainment Before I give you my opinion on where the game stands, take a look at the mid-December update yourself. The update was the third major content update in the game and contained both gameplay-related and platform-related upgrades . The major crux of the update was the addition of new Live Mix buildings and objects. There are now 9 new Live Mix buildings and 22 objects to choose from when creating your racetrack of doom. A new area has also been opened up for use, Maccoll County. Three Fields Entertainment used this to announce the game’s update on X: “Maccoll County Planning Office has granted permission for the new Twining Woods Development – construction work has started and buildings are already starting to pop up ”. The story behind it is that a mountain had been cleared in Maccoll County, which led to the area being opened up. This is a major improvement, in my opinion, since sandbox games are continually expanding their maps. New areas help create a sense of intrigue amongst players. Finally, we have new video settings for both Xbox and PlayStation players. You can now choose between Quality and Performance mode. Quality mode improves the visual quality to 30 FPS and grants players better visual detail. It also targets consistent 4K resolution. Performance mode, on the other hand, keeps your system stable by lowering graphics, but providing smoother gameplay without any crashes. If you’re having trouble finding community content, Wreckreation now highlights the most played and highest rated challenges, with an additional community challenge filter available on the map. And that’s the gist of the mid-December update. State Of The Game: Has Wreckreation Improved? Image: Three Fields Entertainment/THQ Nordic It’s now time to talk about where the game stands, especially compared to its state on release. We have to take into consideration the financial constraints the studio is going through, considering THQ has reduced/stopped funding for the game. The game now runs on Patreon donations to keep making updates. I will say the game has improved quite a lot since its release. There have been a plethora of glitch fixes that have made gameplay more stable, but we have also seen great strides in gameplay. The update in early December introduced cross-play support between Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Crossplay increases the player base substantially and allows friends to easily play with each other cross-platform. They’ve also worked quite hard on visual improvements and minor details. Features with physics-related issues were fixed to increase realism, while different camera angles were also added and/or corrected. We see quite a lot more variation when it comes to building using Live Mix with all the new additions to the game. Both the Share Codes and the Current Games List were major updates to the game. Share Codes allows easy sharing of courses between friends for the user-created challenges, while the Current Games List helps players find more active sessions. These were necessary features following the release of crossplay. And last, but definitely not least, quality-of-life changes. Whether those were fixing game crashes, memory leaks, or simply AI behaviour, Three Fields Entertainment really went all out to keep this game afloat. While Wreckreation might not be everything we were hoping for, the game has improved significantly and continues to do so. The Future Of Wreckreation I understand the skepticism regarding the future of the game, given that it hasn’t fulfilled all its promises. The game is currently in a rocky state, not due to a lack of effort by developers, but rather a financing issue. Depending on how the Patreon situation goes and whether Three Fields Entertainment can find another publisher, we might just see the game’s revival. For now, nothing can be said for certain about the future. But if you were disappointed by the game at launch, I’d definitely recommend giving it another try.",2025-12-23T21:30:00+00:00,Shahmeer Shahzad,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/has-wreckreation-improved-a-look-at-the-game-after-recent-updates/,en,0.8348285555839539
When Will EA FC 26 Come To Xbox Game Pass?,"After the Madden 26 Game Pass prediction, football fans are hungry for more. This is because College Football and Madden games aside, EA FC also follows a similar tradition when it comes to joining the Xbox Game Pass catalogue. With EA FC 24 and EA FC 25 already available for subscribers to download, they can’t wait for the latest installment to drop as well. To satisfy their curiosity, here’s when we can expect EA FC 26 to arrive on Game Pass, according to the trend followed by its predecessors. Things To Consider Image by Operation Sports Before we start, keep in mind that whatever conclusion we reach is purely speculative. As of yet, no official update from Xbox or EA has dropped regarding the EA FC 26 Game Pass situation. Still, for Ultimate subscribers, who can’t wait to get behind the game of two halves, a 10-hour free trial giving a complete test drive is available. Without further delay, let’s start with our analysis. Pattern Followed By Previous EA FC/FIFA Games The data, which will help us estimate a promising Game Pass entry date for this game, comes from the pattern followed by its predecessor. From FIFA 23 to EA FC 25, here’s when each joined Xbox Game Pass after their release. EA FC/FIFA Title Game Release Date Game Pass Addition Date FIFA 23 30th September 2022 16th May 2023 EA FC 24 29th September 2023 25th June 2024 EA FC 25 27th September 2024 12th June 2025 Judging by the table, each game has been added to the catalogue 8 to 9 months after the original release date. When Will EA FC 26 Come To Xbox Game Pass? With all of the intel in mind, adding around 9 months to the EA FC 26 release date gives us its unofficial Game Pass entry date. By doing the math, the subscribers can expect the game on 26th June 2026, which is nearly 6 months away from today. With still plenty of time left, those who are not planning to buy the game separately have no choice but to continue enjoying EA FC 25. That’s all for now. As mentioned earlier, this is an unofficial prediction. If we are lucky, we might get an early Game Pass entrance; otherwise, waiting or buying the game are the only choices.",2025-12-23T21:00:00+00:00,Shahmeer Shahzad,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/when-will-ea-fc-26-come-to-xbox-game-pass/,en,0.6762996912002563
New Tease Sparks Speculation About AAA’s Presence in WWE 2K26,"As we inch closer to the WWE 2K26 release , there are quite a lot of questions around new wrestlers making their way to the game. For weeks, there has been a lot of speculation that AAA wrestlers will make their debut in 2K26 . Today, Adrian Butler , senior referee for WWE NXT and producer for Mexico’s Lucha Libre AAA, further stirred the pot with the following post on Twitter/X: The excitement and anticipation for @WWEgames #wwe2k26 has begun! Not a bad idea, @NutshellTheFan ! #LuchaLibreAAA pic.twitter.com/SayQy8s3mW — Darryl Sharma (@AdrianButlerWWE) December 22, 2025 The post shows a photo of Adrian Butler (Darryl Sharma) himself alongside other AAA referees. With the caption featuring the WWE 2K26 hashtag, this is a direct nod to the possibility of AAA’s inclusion in WWE 2K26. For years, the WWE 2K series has focused on the WWE umbrella exclusively. The developers occasionally dip into ECW or WCW for nostalgia, but anything beyond that remains to be seen. What The AAA Partnership Could Look Like For WWE 2K26 We previously talked about whether or not TNA stars can make an appearance in WWE 2K26 . The problem with that idea is that WWE doesn’t own TNA, so getting rights/licenses for wrestlers can be time-consuming and costly. That same problem doesn’t exist with AAA, as WWE basically owns them. Here’s what a user on the r/WWEGames subreddit thinks: “If I were gonna put money on it, I’d say you’ll probably get 2-3 AAA guys plus an arena as unlockables in the MyRise and anyone beyond that’ll be DLC.” Maybe we see a dedicated “Lucha Libre” chapter in MyRise. The mode could ask players to travel to Mexico and compete in a recreation of the iconic Triplemania area. This would allow 2K to introduce a handful of high-profile AAA stars — the likes of Mr. Iguana, Psycho Clown, and Pagano. However, given the technical hurdles of full-roster integration, the DLC route seems to be the most logical. By including a couple of marquee names as unlockables, they can test the waters for interest in a dedicated AAA DLC pack down the line. This might please the hardcore fanbase, but more importantly, give some variety to a series that lacks Mexican/indie wrestling influence and culture. If the tease we’ve seen today is any indication, that boundary may get erased soon.",2025-12-23T20:30:00+00:00,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/new-tease-sparks-speculation-about-aaas-presence-in-wwe-2k26/,de,0.3272746503353119
Review – Radiolight (Steam/PC),"If you go down to the woods today… you’re in for a fright Radiolight is a single player first person thriller, developed and published by Kryštof Knesl. Set in the fictional town of Ashwood Creek in 1980’s America, you play as police officer Ethan Collins who is investigating the disappearance of a 14 year old boy in the national park, and the possible disappearance of park ranger Harvey Waters. The game begins at your home. You wander around looking at various items and opening drawers to get used to the controls until you go into your daughter Mia’s room, where she will give you the radio that will become one of your main tools soon enough. After your conversation with Mia you hear the phone ringing downstairs, answering it will send you to the national park on the hunt for Harvey. When you arrive at the visitors centre at the entrance to the park, you notice several things out of place and use your walkie talkie to report to Rob, your colleague. A prompt will appear on screen when you need to report something, usually over the item, but sometimes a speech bubble will appear in the top right of the screen to tell you to get on your walkie talkie. During conversations you will have multiple choices of response, you can only pick one to advance the conversation and there is a limited time to choose. Once you are done looking around the visitors centre, you take the key to the park gate and enter the woods. Radiolight takes place at night and there are no lights in the wood, so you will rely heavily on your flashlight for most of the game, this helps make the world feel much bigger than it is. There is no map or compass to follow, but the game herds you in the right direction with natural barriers and the occasional sign pointing to certain places such as the rangers cabin or an observation point. One area Radiolight excels is in its music, sound effects and its use of quiet environments. At times when wandering the woods, ominous music will start. With the low visibility due to the darkness and concentration of trees, the woods become very creepy, the sound effects make the game feel tense and you expect to jump out of your skin frequently, but the game doesn’t make heavy use of jump scares or gore, so when it does happen make sure you have a helmet on as you will hit the ceiling. I would suggest playing the game with headphones as it really enhances the experience and makes the wood feel alive, it also increases the tension you feel at being alone except for Rob on the other end of the walkie talkie. Speaking of radios, you can walk around with yours on whenever you want and tune it to different stations. There is not much choice of what to listen to but there is a music station which isn’t bad, though I didn’t listen to it much myself as it seemed out of place to me in the setting. At certain points of the game when you tune the radio, the frequency indicator will turn red and a broken voice speaks to you. This voice reminded me of Bumblebee from the Transformers films in the way that it uses male and female voices for different words while speaking, what it says could be taken as a warning or a threat, you will have to find out. The story is very well done, what starts as a regular investigation soon takes a dark turn (no pun intended) towards the supernatural. Radiolight is a slow paced game, but that suits well with the story it tells, and you get as much out of your own observation as you do from what the game gives you. There is little action in the game, and it is unlike anything I have played before, based on your use of your radio to tune to the right signal before shadowy creatures can get to you.

Review – Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted (PS5),"Fresh from the 2010s, Plant vs. Zombies has made its return to the spotlight with Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. Available on PC, PS5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, developers PopCap Games and The Lost Pixels claim that the Replanted version of the game is “bigger, brighter and crazier than before.” Plants vs. Zombies was all the rage when it was released, even I was a victim of the game’s craze. Fourteen years later, here we are testing the remastered version – the circle of life. Let’s see how this tower defense game stands up against time. The graphics for Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted are good, as would be expected of a remaster. The small cyclical animations used for the game are smooth and well done, maintaining the old school style without seeming clunky. There’s not much to say for the graphics otherwise. The style maintains the simplistic and bright visuals of the original, just in high definition. There’s a fun toggle in the settings to give the plants and/or zombies a retro pixelated style. Completely unnecessary, but a bit of wholesome fun. Audio is the same as the original game, with jazzy little jingles and shooting sound effects. It’s minimalistic and aligned with the original but again, nothing noteworthy. Gameplay was fun, and could be addicting for some. For me, this tower defense style is too repetitive and gets old fast. The nostalgia of the game still made the playthrough entertaining. The gameplay style, however, does feel foreign on a controller, as the mechanisms were designed for mobile, but it is manageable and easy still. Perfect for children, or other adults looking for a hit of nostalgia. There are very few differences between the mobile version of Plants vs. Zombies and Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. This is because, as much as they might advertise “bigger” and “better”, it is still just a remaster. The new version includes cut content which, while not featured on the mobile game, was still accessible through other methods. Multiplayer modes have been ported from early console versions of the game, allowing vs and co-op play too. There are also two additional game modes. Cloudy Days reduces the amount of sunshine/points received and R.I.P mode is a perma-death mode where failing a level resets the player to the beginning, adding difficulty tiers to the game. For those who get addicted to tower defense style games, I can imagine the rage inducing pain of losing R.I.P mode. Overall, Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted was a fun way to pass some time, but nothing special. For those who had a true connection with the original game or love nostalgic games, its worth the time but £17.99 is a steep cost for what was essentially a free mobile game. I won’t judge you if you want to spend the money on an innocent bit of fun, as it it faithful to the original mobile game. However, for myself personally I don’t see it being a game I would return to except out of extreme boredom. The game code for this review was provided by EA .

Arcade Returns in Miniature with the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player,"PAC-MAN has hit the shelves once again, marking another resurgence of the iconic yellow glutton. First making an appearance in 1980, PAC-MAN continues to be a celebrity on the gaming scene. My Arcade has collaborated with Bandai to create a miniaturised version of the classic arcade game. The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is a portable retro arcade machine fitted with a 3.5″ screen and built-in speakers. This machine boasts two game modes and two-player play in one small package. Retro gaming has lasted the test of time and remained popular amongst gamers and hipsters alike, making this a potential hit for collectors. For this review, I combined forces with mum, a 70s baby who lived through the PAC-MAN hype first hand. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● First Impressions First impressions of the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player is the packaging. The packaging is simple and maintains the theme with a simple border design shaped like the machine inside. The classic PAC-MAN logo is featured and small enough that the Joystick Player remains the main focal point. Each package contains a My Arcade Certificate of Authenticity, confirming the product is officially licensed by Bandai. This is a cool little addition, making the Joystick Player seem more valuable. Realistically, there is no serial number attached to the certificate so one could be easily faked to up value knock-offs. Still, the concept is quite fun. Build and Durability The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is incredibly light yet still sturdy. It withstood a good shake and a few (accidental) tumbles. There’s a plastic cover protecting the screen that’s printed with the PAC-MAN game scene. The game interface is simple – a screen, four buttons, and the joystick. The joystick itself has the familiar clunkiness of a life-size retro arcade machine. It’s sturdy in its socket and feels durable, rather than the cheap tacky plastic most mini machines used. The same can be said of the overall machine. It feels sturdy and well-constructed, like an actual console instead of a mini-machine Nothing but the best for PAC-MAN I suppose. The battery compartment is on the rear of the machine. This PAC-MAN machine takes four AA-battery. I was briefly surprised and annoyed by this, as I expect most electronics to be rechargeable. I then looked down and saw the USB-C port, so this electronic is indeed rechargeable using a wire most people have in possession. Audio comes from the small speaker just above the battery component. The volume is adjusted using the plus and minus shaped buttons on either side of the power switch. An audio jack is available for sound output. The power switch requires a firm push and makes an audible click, giving it that clunky retro feel. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Performance There isn’t much I can say for performance – it’s PAC-MAN, just miniature. Fans of the original, or of similar retro games, will no doubt enjoy this PAC-MAN Joystick Player. It’s true to original with the gameplay and graphics. The only difference is the pixels are much, much clearer. Players start the game by adding ‘credits’ to the machine before selecting play-mode. I struggled with directing my little PAC-MAN with the joystick, but this was simply a skill issue. Handing the game to my mum, she smashed it. Two-player mode isn’t simultaneous play. With the size of the machine, simultaneous play would be near impossible. Instead, the second player begins when the first player dies and vice versa until all lives are used up. This adds pressure to keep the game out of your friends hands and claim the highest score. Speed Up mode is the same game with added anxiety. Everything remains the same but PAC-MAN picks up speed, flying across the map. Both modes are fun, but if I continued to play on speed-up mode the Joystick Player would also be flying… out the window. Audio comes from one small speaker, giving it a tinny sound reminiscent of retro arcades. This is a nice hit of nostalgia and, similar to real arcades, only fuels the game-induced rage. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Summary Overall, the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player was a great gadget for nostalgic fun. Its portable size makes it easy to take to parties and gathering for easy entertainment. I also found it to be a great shared experience between myself and my mum, and a way to introduce new generations to the classics. The certificate of authenticity gives it a sense of legitimacy that makes it feel more valuable than just a toy. More importantly, the Joystick Player is sturdy and durable, making it fit for travel or being manhandled by a toddler. I can’t speak for how it performs over time, but so far I’m more than happy with the product.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is Hideo Kojima’s “Masterpiece” Because it’s His Latest Game,"In a new video courtesy of Wired, Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima has referred to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach as his “masterpiece”. In the video, where he answers questions asked by fans of his works, Kojima clarified that he always looks at the most recent project he worked on as his best one so far. When asked “what do you consider your masterpiece,” Kojima responded by saying that he gets asked this question a lot, and “my latest work is my masterpiece. So that would be Death Stranding 2.” Throughout the video, he also went into more detail about various aspects of game development, including how he sees the interactivity offered by video games as a medium being its most important and interesting aspect. For instance, he is asked what makes a game “good” for him. To this he responds by noting that, along with the love of its creator, a game is often good based on how well it uses its interactivity. “First, the creator’s love,” said Kojima. “That’s key. Also, since it is interactive, say there’s an item with one intended use. But it doesn’t end there. The player thinks ‘Maybe I can use it this way too?’ and tries it out. It works, and they think, ‘Oh, cool!’ Then they try another way, and realize that’s prepared too. It’s about that level of freedom. The player discovers things for themselves, and finds those mechanics.” This answer is in turn summarized as: “You have to feel the creator’s love. A great game offers a high level of freedom, allowing players to discover their own unique ways to utilize items.” Another question asked by a hobbyist game developer revolves around how the developer can make a game that “never gets old, one you want to replay after completing it,” to which Kojima responds by noting that the important aspects of a game aren’t just their stories, but also their worlds, controls, and immersion. “You want to be there,” he explained. “It’s about making you want to stay and play. Say you stop playing for the night. You go to school or work. The key is wanting to return to that world. Making the player want to dive back in is crucial for games. There’s a unique world inside that space, where you can be different from your ordinary self. It lets you do things you can’t do in real life. That’s vital.” In the same Q&A video, Kojima had also spoken about what kinds of projects he would like to work on in the future . When asked about new genres he wanted to take on, Kojima responded by saying that “I want to pioneer a new genre, so I don’t focus much on existing ones.” This project, according to Kojima, would be based on “maybe hard sci-fi,” because “I love space settings, so I’d like to try that. I’m also a fan of Westerns, so maybe that. Or a period piece, but those exist already.” After having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach earlier this year, Kojima’s studio—Kojima Productions—is currently working on two projects: horror title OD and espionage game Physint . In the meantime, check out our review of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach , which is currently only available on PS5.",2025-12-24T12:55:40+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-hideo-kojimas-masterpiece-because-its-his-latest-game,en,0.6485784649848938
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Director Explains How Studio Experimented With AI But Didn’t Like It,"In light of recent controversies surrounding Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 having gotten its Indie Game Awards wins revoked due to its undisclosed use of generative AI, director Guillaume Brioche has now confirmed just how developer Sandfall Interactive had experimented with using the technology when the RPG was being made. In a Q&A session with YouTuber Sushi (which you can check out below), Broche spoke about how everything we can see in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is human-made. However, generative AI coming out in 2022 led to the studio experimenting with the technology as a potential tool. “Yeah, we’re aware of what’s been going on with [ Divinity director Swen Vincke’s statements about AI use ],” explained Broche in response to a question about the studio’s use of generative AI and how it will be used in the future. “But I can say, everything in the game is human made. When AI first really came out in 2022, we’d already started on the game. It was just a new tool, we tried it, and we didn’t like it at all. It felt wrong. We had originally used it as a placeholder for textures we missed, but we took it out as soon as we found it.” “But yeah, the concept art, voice actors, everything is human made. It’s pretty hard what the future [of the industry] will look like, but everything will be made by humans from us.” Broche was referring to Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke’s statements about the use of generative AI at the studio from earlier this month. His statements about how generative AI was being used to “explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text,” drew quite a bit of controversy among fans of Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 , who noted that using it in concept art would taint the rest of the art that was built on top for the game. This criticism had prompted Vincke to issue another statement later where he spoke about how the tools were working as “additive” to the talents of the creative teams rather than generative AI serving as replacements to artists themselves. “We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse,” said Vincke. The use of generative AI in the gaming industry has been a hot-button issue for a while, but discussions have largely picked up over the previous month, with Warhorse Studios’ Daniel Vávra writing his own lengthy statement about how the world should stop resisting the rise and proliferation of generative AI. In his statement, he noted that “AI is here to stay with us.” “As frightening as it may be, that’s the way it is,” he continued. “Personally, it scares me the most in the music because you can’t even recognise AI there anymore.” Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima also spoke about AI, and how we can’t go back to a world without it, comparing the technology to smartphones .",2025-12-24T12:25:21+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-explains-how-studio-experimented-with-ai-but-didnt-like-it,en,0.6804551482200623
"Squadron 42 is Now Fully Playable, Will be Over 40 Hours in Length","With 2025 coming to an end, Star Citizen and Squadron 42 developer Cloud Imperium Games has provided an update on the development of both titles through a new Letter From the Chairman post by creator Chris Roberts. In his post, Roberts reflected on the number of updates that were made to the alpha builds of Star Citizen throughout the year, while also confirming that all chapters of Squadron 42 are now playable. Roberts also noted that Squadron 42 measures in at over 40 hours in length, and that the developers are now working on “remaining polish, optimization, and bug fixing.” He also wrote about how Cloud Imperium Games had worked throughout 2025 to build on the development progress it had made on Squadron 42 back in 2024, with a focus on “bringing the game to content complete and closing out remaining core tasks in preparation for Beta.” “A big part of what makes this possible is the technology we’ve built at CIG over many years,” wrote Roberts. “The ability to move seamlessly from on foot, into a vehicle you can fly and move around inside, down to a planet or across star systems, all without loading screens, creates a level of immersion that’s very difficult to replicate. That combination of close-up interaction and galactic scale is at the core of what will make Squadron 42 so unique.” “Equally important is the quality of the content itself. From writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design, the level of care across the entire game is something I’m incredibly proud of. Combined with deeply interactive systems, it creates an experience that pulls you into the world and keeps you there.” As for Star Citizen , Roberts also wrote about a recently-released experimental update released for the game’s Alpha 4.5 build which brings in support for VR headsets. He noted that this “Christmas Surprise” originally started as a passion project and started getting the attention of developers as well as fans of Star Citizen . As part of this VR mode, “almost everything” has been physicalized, which means that it can be interacted with by players with their own hands regardless of whether they are playing in first or third-person views. The VR mode, he noted, also helps further justify the work that Cloud Imperium Games has put into detailing its various environments, props, ships and gear, since players can now experience these things at true scale. The VR mode is still considered “an early and experimental step,” however, and the developers are still working on more ways to improve it. Looking to the future, the studio plans on bringing in a number of improvements to the technology it has already introduced to Star Citizen and Squadron 42 . Among these making Server Meshing—first introduced to Star Citizen through an update earlier this year , allowing the server meshes to automatically reconfigure themselves in real-time based on player activity and server load. There will also be more in-game content introduced over the next year to Star Citizen ’s alpha. Squadron 42 , on the other hand, is currently moving towards its Beta release. However, Cloud Imperium Games hasn’t confirmed when this Beta release is slated to happen.",2025-12-24T11:33:37+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/squadron-42-is-now-fully-playable-will-be-40-hours-in-length,en,0.9779782295227051
The Witcher 3 to Get New DLC in May 2026 as Lead Up to The Witcher 4’s 2027 Release – Analyst,"While CD Projekt RED has been working on The Witcher 4 , and Fool’s Theory is working on a remake of the original The Witcher , analysts believe that the two studios are also working together for a brand new DLC for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt . According to Polish publication Strefa Inwestorów , Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski is predicting a major new DLC that would bridge the gap between the story of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and The Witcher 4 will be coming out in May 2026. Chrzanowski’s predictions indicate that the DLC will be priced at $30, and that it will come to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt —which originally came out on PC, PS4 and Xbox One all the way back on May 18, 2015. This DLC is also expected to properly kick off the marketing push for The Witcher 4 , which is expected to come out in late 2027. It is worth noting that the two major DLCs released for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine —have already wrapped up the majority of the story arc for protagonist Geralt of Rivia. With that in mind, as well as the fact that The Witcher 4 will feature a brand new protagonist in the form of Geralt’s adopted daughter Ciri, this rumoured DLC will likely give us a deeper glimpse at her story, including the kind of training she goes through to become the hardened witcher we saw in the reveal trailer for The Witcher 4 . Fool’s Theory is rumoured to be taking lead on the development of this DLC, since the studio also has several developers that have previously worked on games in The Witcher franchise in the past. CD Projekt RED itself is yet to make any announcement or offer any confirmation about this DLC, however. As for the remake of the original The Witcher , CD Projekt RED has confirmed that it is slated for release some time after the release of Polaris —the studio’s internal codename for The Witcher 4 . In an earnings call, president and joint CEO of CD Projekt Group Adam Kiciński spoke about how the remake will make use of Unreal Engine 5-based technology that was also used in The Witcher 4 . “Coming back to The Witcher Remake and when it will come,” said Kiciński. “Yes, it will come after Polaris , which is a consequence of how we think about this project. I think The Witcher Remake will be based in big part on technologies from Polaris , so it will be developed partially in parallel to Polaris . But once Polaris is launched, everything for Polaris will be then in the final shape, and it will be partially reused in the remake.” Fool’s Theory CEO Jakub Rokosz has also spoken about the studio’s work on The Witcher remake back in January 2024, where he noted that the studio will be taking out parts of the original title that are considered bad, outdated or “unnecessarily convoluted” by modern gaming standards .",2025-12-24T11:08:42+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/the-witcher-3-to-get-new-dlc-in-may-2026-as-lead-up-to-the-witcher-4s-release-in-2027-analyst,en,0.9676143527030945
"007 First Light Delayed to May 27th, 2026","Grand Theft Auto 6 has some company in the delay department as IO Interactive has announced it’s pushing back the release of 007 First Light . Don’t worry, though – the action-adventure title will now be releasing two months later on May 27th, 2026. In a Bluesky post, studio CEO Hakan Abrak revealed that the project is “fully playable from beginning to end,” and that the additional time “will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch.” As the company’s “most ambitious project to date” with far more systems than its Hitman franchise , Abrak also feels that the decision “allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.” Of course, there will be more updates on the title early next year, so stay tuned for that. Besides, with Crimson Desert, Replaced, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection and more launching in the same month, shifting to a less busy month could pan out better. Unless other big games are announced for the same time, that is. 007 First Light is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Check out the latest trailer , which showcases Lenny Kravitz as Bawma, one of the antagonists.

Ubisoft Working With Nintendo to Improve VRR Support in More Games,"While it’s no secret that Ubisoft has maintained a close relationship with Nintendo over the years, going as far as making exclusive games for the latter’s consoles, in a new interview, the company has revealed that it is helping Nintendo with improving support for variable refresh rate (VRR) across other games on the Switch 2. While Ubisoft had already spoken about how it achieved VRR support in the Switch 2 version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows , the studio went into more detail with FRVR about the techniques used, including a dedicated algorithm. Ubisoft noted that “both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws use a similar technique to take advantage of Switch 2’s Variable Refresh Rate, even below 40Hz”. “Since Shadows targets 30fps, and the console’s VRR currently only works at 40Hz or higher, we use a clever workaround,” explained the company. “The same frame is effectively presented twice, once in the middle of the frame and again at the end, so the hardware outputs at a 60Hz interval while maintaining smooth visuals”. Ubisoft went on to confirm that this same technology that allows its titles to support VRR on the Switch 2 is now part of the company’s in-house Anvil Engine, which powers all of the company’s modern games. This means that it can also be used for future titles, including the rumoured upcoming Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag Resynced , which will likely also make its way to the Switch 2. Along with this, Ubisoft is “continuing to work with Nintendo to improve VRR support going forward.” While Ubisoft has already released both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws on the Nintendo Switch 2 , it is currently unknown whether the company will bring its other major title— Rainbow Six Siege X —to the platform. Speaking about this, creative director Alexander Karpazis had noted back in October that it wasn’t currently focusing on bringing the competitive shooter to more platforms. However, he also said that it doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t come to Nintendo’s console, using the adage “never say never” . “For us, the focus will always be on the platforms we’re on right now, making sure that it’s the best experience, and when we do new gameplay [that] it makes use of the platforms that we’re on. So right now, any new platform isn’t necessarily a focus for us. But again, we’re a live game, it’s 10 years. I learnt a long time ago to never say never, so we’ll see as platforms grow and new opportunities come up too,” he said in an interview. As for Assassin’s Creed Shadows , Ubisoft revealed in its recent earnings report last month that the open-world action adventure title has been overperforming . In its earnings report, the company noted that the title benefitted from post-launch updates, including the free update that brought in New Game+, as well as the release of the Claws of Awaji expansion. The Assassin’s Creed franchise as a whole has also managed to generate “211 million session days,” which Ubisoft noted was 35 percent higher than the average from the last few years.",2025-12-23T13:24:15+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-will-work-with-nintendo-to-improve-vrr-support-in-more-games,en,0.8507245182991028
"Grand Theft Auto 6 Will Not See Another Delay At Risk of Losing Hype, Says Former Animator","While Rockstar Games has already had to delay the highly-anticipated title Grand Theft Auto 6 , former animator for the studio, Mike York doesn’t believe that the game will face any more delays. Speaking to Esports Insider (via Dexerto ), York noted that the currently-planned November 19, 2026 release date for Grand Theft Auto 6 is a good time for the game to come out thanks to it being just a month before Christmas, which tends to be a popular time for shopping. “I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas,” said York. “Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time.” As for the reasons behind the delay— Grand Theft Auto 6 was originally planned for release in May 20260—York believes that the studio has been hard at work to ensure that the game is as good as it possibly can be. This includes the need for polish as well, since the studio also has quite a bit on the line in terms of its reputation and potential revenue. “If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be,” he said. “They’re polishing stuff. I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.” At this point, York also doesn’t think there will be any more delays for the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 . According to him, this largely comes down to the current hype behind the game. However, constant delays will likely end up with people having stopped caring about the game. “If Rockstar Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6 ,” said York. “Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.” “People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it,” he continued. “They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’” While there has undoubtedly been plenty of hype behind Grand Theft Auto 6 , developer Rockstar Games has also recently come under fire for having fired more than 30 of its employees for what it called “gross misconduct.” The employees themselves, along with the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) have been protesting the company, calling its acts union busting .",2025-12-23T12:37:02+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-not-see-another-delay-at-risk-of-losing-hype-says-former-animator,en,0.6854504942893982
Doom Co-Creator’s New Game Will be Great For Fans of Classic id Software Shooters – Rumour,"While Romero Games’ at-risk shooter has seemingly been rescued from being scrapped, few details have been officially revealed about the title so far. A new report, courtesy of Insider Gaming, however, reveals quite a bit of information, including the fact that it was originally going to be titled Hellslayer , and would have several inspirations from games like Hotline Miami in terms of its mechanics. In a new episode of the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast, Mike Straw has revealed that the title would involve players taking on the role of a priest that is fighting demons. “The new game is not what was [being made] in a partnership with Microsoft,” said Straw. “That game is gone, but they’re taking elements from it.” He went on to discuss the fact that the original version of the game was titled Hellslayer . “It was a first-person shooter inspired by Hotline Miami , meaning that if you die and would just come to life right away,” he continued. While Straw wasn’t able to reveal what elements of this older title were being carried over into the new game, he expressed quite a bit of enthusiasm about what he has learned, especially for players that are already fans of classic id Software titles like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D . As for why only parts of the original iteration of the game are being brought over into the new title, Straw speculated that it likely came down to the developers taking the time to see what they had and making a decision to narrow down the scope of the game. Doom co-creator John Romero himself had confirmed that this shooter project had been saved after having gone through some major changes. In a discussion at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid earlier this month, Romero said that the title had “been basically completely redesigned,” while also noting that it “incorporates a lot of the elements” from the original incarnation of the game. “We’re not starting at ground zero,” explained Romero. “We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.” As part of this redesign, Romero has also confirmed that the scope had been changed, making the newer incarnation of the title a “much smaller game” than what it used to be. This, he noted, also had the added benefit of revitalising the development team. He said, “the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn’t actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that”. “[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that’s why small teams are great,” he continued. Romero had confirmed that this project had been saved a few months after Romero Games CEO Brenda Romero had announced its cancellation from investors having pulled out . At the time, development on the game was noted as going quite well, with the studio being able to hit all required milestones.",2025-12-23T12:00:00+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/doom-co-creators-new-game-will-be-great-for-fans-of-classic-id-software-shooters-rumour,en,0.4094577133655548
EA’s Board Approves $55 Billion Acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s PIF and Other Investors,"The planned acquisition of EA by a consortium of investors made up of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Affinity Partners and Silver Lake Partners has now been approved by EA’s shareholders. As caught by Stephen Totilo, the deal is valued at around $55 billion, and the next major step for this acquisition will be for all of the companies involved to get approval from the appropriate government regulatory bodies. “As of 2:03pm PT, EA’s shareholders have officially approved EA’s $55 billion sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund,” confirmed Totilo on social media. “The deal will next need to receive approval from government regulators.” The deal was originally announced all the way back in September, and involves a complete buyout of EA that will make the company a privately-owned one. As part of the deal, the current shareholders of EA will be paid $210 per share in cash, which is noted as being a premium of 25 percent over EA’s share price as of the market closing on September 25, 2025, when each share was priced at $168.32. “Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said EA CEO and chairman Andrew Wilson in a statement announcing the deal. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.” According to a more recent report, the deal will end up with Saudi Arabia’s PIF owning 93.4 percent of EA . Silver Lake Partners and Affinity Partners will end up with ownership of 5.5 percent and 1.1 percent of the company respectively. Before this acquisition, the PIF already had a 9.9 percent stake on EA. “This investment embodies Silver Lake’s mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” said Silver Lake co-CEO and managing partner Egon Durban.. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.” Proceedings surrounding the acquisition are expected to get completed in Q1 FY2027, and will result in the company’s shares no longer being listed on any stock exchange. Wilson will also continue in his role as EA’s CEO, with the company’s headquarters continuing to be based out of Redwood City, California.

The PSN January Sale is now on with big savings,"As tradition, the PSN January Sale has kicked off before Christmas so it can tempt you to spend those PSN Gift cards straight away. Also as tradition, the savings depend on where you are in the world so there’s no easy way to collate them all but hopefully this should give you an idea of what’s on offer. The final tradition is that the banner adverts on the store lie, you can actually save up to 90%, not 75%. There are some really good offers this time, especially if you are picking up older games. Control: Ultimate Edition is cheaper than a pint and under £6 so if you have not played that, then you really should grab it, and I can also recommend Still Wakes The Deep: The Complete Edition , which is a few pennies over £13. You are also completely mad if you don’t pick up Limbo AND Inside for £2.19. A word of warning, the store is still packed full of rubbish shovelware, but if you really want to jack up your Platinum trophy count then Beanball is on sale for seven pence – yes, 7p – and you can get the Plat in 5 mins. More recent games with savings include Silent Hill f , Battlefield 6 , and ARC Raiders. I think I am going to grab Dispatch. Here are our top picks from the UK Store.

007: First Light has been delayed by two months to May 2026,"IO Interactive has announced that 007: First Light has been delayed by two months to 27th May 2026. In a classic text image announcement on social media, IOI CEO and game director Hakan Abrak writes: “007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one. “The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game.” What’s a bit daft is that they only announced the previous March release date back in September , and just had a splashy cast announcement at The Game Awards, with Lenny Kravitz playing the villain Bawma . And then they’ve waited right up until Christmas Eve Eve to confirm this latest delay… I’ve no doubt that IO are very, very thankful that GTA 6 was recently delayed to the back end of 2026 , having previously been slated for 26th May 2026 . Otherwise the studio would have really painted themselves into a corner with 007: First Light wanting more polish. They’re pretty lucky to now have this extra breathing room. Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview , with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise. So… 007: First Light is coming out on 27th May 2026 across PS5 , Xbox Series X|S , Nintendo Switch 2 and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Racing Game,"As we speed towards the close of the year, we’re going to take a handbrake turn into our award for best racing game, so pop your seatbelt on (and let’s be honest, you really should be wearing one if you’re pulling a handbrake turn), ease off the throttle, and enjoy a drive-by of our top picks. It’s been a decent year for racing games, particularly in the arcade and kart racing genres, with the lighter end of the racing spectrum proving to be a big hit with our team, and the community at large. What can we say? The Nintendo Switch 2 needed a killer launch title, and Nintendo delivered it with Mario Kart World . That ‘World’ in the title is doing a good chunk of tone-setting, because it’s the first open-world Mario Kart game, and you can tootle off, driving across a huge island, and find the answers to all sorts of unknowable questions, like, where do Toads like to go for breakfast? And how long can I follow this Shy Guy for? It’s easy-going, and genuinely likeable, and you can explore the tracks and the larger world to your heart’s content, with Nintendo having filled the place with interesting little visual treats and gatherings that you can ruin by barrelling through them. Thankfully, the racing action itself is as tight as ever, and Grand Prix now see you racing between the different track locations, adding a new feel to each event. It is familiar, but when Mario Kart 8 gave us a decade of incredible racing, we probably shouldn’t feel too hard done by when Nintendo has chosen to do a bit of inventing too. The biggest and freshest highlight has to be the addition of Knockout Tour, bringing a Battle Royale flavour to Mario Kart’s already-brutal karting combat by whittling a larger-than-ever field of racers down through a series of areas, before ending in a four-racer battle to first place. It’s thrilling, frustrating, and unmissable, and you’ll keep coming back time and time again. Fast Fusion – Runner Up The Nintendo Switch 2 didn’t just get one arcade racer at launch, it got two, and Fast Fusion found its way into nearly as many hearts as Mario Kart World did at launch. How did it manage that? Well, it was priced incredibly competitively, an indie game that proved to be the cheapest game at the new console’s launch – no, we’re not including Welcome Tour here – and on top of that, its sci-fi racing was utterly brilliant, winning plaudits from critics and gamers alike. Framed within the same sub-genre as Wipeout or F-Zero, Fast Fusion is actually the latest entry in the Fast series from Shin’en Multimedia, who’ve continually rung both incredible performance and visuals out of Nintendo’s humble systems. Its colour-changing mechanic for boosting means you can never switch off through races, and the Fusion aspect that lets you combine vehicles means that you can create something that truly feels like your own craft. Fast Fusion looks and feels so good, you could almost mistake it for a AAA title. In our minds, it is one. Tokyo Xtreme Racer – Runner Up Here’s where the resurgence of arcade racers became clear in 2025. Alongside JDM, Tokyo Xtreme Racer returned us to the kind of racing game that epitomised the Dreamcast and PS2 era. In Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s case, that was the last time we had an entry in the series, with the most recent entry arriving all the way back in 2007. The brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer put us on Tokyo’s highways and byways let us loose, allowing you to challenge anyone you like to a race, beating scrubs, upgrading your car, and working your way through every possible rival. The racing is fundamentally unique too, built on a ‘stamina/tug-of-war’ system where the race is won by finding and maintaining a lead on your rival for a certain amount of time, and not just reaching a clear finish line. It’s got heaps of content, feels completely different from eveything else this year, and reminds us of a time when everything was simpler. In 2025, that’s as good as it gets. Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) NASCAR 25 Sonic Racing: Crossworlds Alright, that’s it for this award, and you’ll excuse us for not stopping before we race off to the next one. For some reason, we’re not allowed to drop below 50MPH, which would be rather scary if Keanu Reeves wasn’t on the bus with us.",2025-12-23T16:30:43+00:00,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/game-of-the-year-2025-best-racing-game/,en,0.5455463528633118
Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties adds a new Bad Boy Dragon mode,"Ryu Ga Gotoku studio and their English localisation team are treading a very fine line with some newly revealed features and game modes for Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties . Revealed in a newly streamed showcase for the game are the Bad Boy Dragon mode for Kiwami 3, and Hell’s Arena in the Dark Ties bundled spin-off. Yakuza Kiwami 3 is a remake of the third game in the popular crime drama series, recreating the PS3 original with some modernisation and new additions. As Kiryu has to save Okinawa’s Morning Glory Orphanage from those looking to force him and the children out of their home, he’ll be able to jump into a new Bad Boy Dragon mode. Morning Glory and Bad (Boy) Dragon? Ahem! So, what do you do in Bad Boy Dragon? Well, basically, Kiryu joins and leads the Haisai Girls gang to dominance. You’ll gather allies and train them up until they can take on the toughest gangs in the country, fighting in turf wars for territory, jumping into Baddies Battles with a small party of five, or going for a 20-member battle in Rumbles. You can also hop onto your motorbikes and raid enemy bases. There’s a ton of customisation here that looks like it could be a fun timesink. Then there’s Dark Ties, which sees Yoshitaka Mine trying to bolster his reputation and rise through the ranks. This is a fresh side-story to the main Yakuza 3 tale, but RGG has now revealed the Hell’s Arena underground fight club that you can dive into. Your goal is to dive into 1v1 Hellish Brawls and perilous races to avoid hunters through a treasure-filled dungeon in Survival Hell. Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties is set to launch on 12th February 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S , Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.

Persona 3 Reload update 1.03 brings better Switch 2 frame rates,"Atlus has released an update for Persona 3 Reload on Nintendo Switch 2 , with version 1.03 promising improved frame rate stability and a new docked performance mode. One of the main criticisms of Persona 3 Reload for its Switch 2 release surrounded the performance of the game on Nintendo’s new handheld. Targeting 30FPS made sense, but with both the game’s demo and the full release, fans and reviewers alike noted that there were frame rate drops. Version 1.03 is the answer to this, and it promises to boost frame rate stability across both handheld and docked play at 30FPS. However, if you pop your Switch 2 into a dock to play on TV, then a new performance mode is available to target 60FPS, which is a pretty impressive jump up. This update will also be rolled back to the demo of the game, to help give a new and correct impression of what performance will be like. That’s expected in the coming days, but Atlus had better hurry, because they’ve put the game on sale with a 15% discount on the eShop through 4th January, and people will certainly want to wait and see how it holds up now. Here’s the brief patch notes for Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03: Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability In our review of the Switch 2 release of Persona 3 Reload, Nic said, “Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.” Source: press release",2025-12-23T13:56:03+00:00,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/persona-3-reload-update-1-03-brings-better-switch-2-frame-rates/,en,0.491664856672287
Pokémon Legends: Z–A Mega Dimension DLC Review,"Given how much I enjoyed Pokémon Legends Z–A — more than most people, if some parts of the internet are to be believed — I was really looking forward to the Mega Dimension DLC. The good news is that the best bits of Z–A are still there, along with a bevy of Pokémon missing from the base game and a slew of brand-new Mega Evolutions to keep things interesting. The problem is that getting between the exciting new bits is a bit of a slog. So, what is this DLC in a nutshell? Basically, after the near-apocalyptic ending of the game, a young girl called Ansha shows up with her friend, Hoopa, and asks for your help making some donuts. Being the do-gooder that you are, you accept — it’s honestly not the weirdest request you’ve had since getting to Lumiose, so you set about getting the one missing ingredient you need. Events transpire and you wind up in Hyperspace Lumiose — a sterile-looking pocket dimension mirroring a small chunk of the city you have just come from. The main difference between the real world and Hyperspace Lumiose, other than the very muted colour palette, is that the Pokémon here aren’t native to Lumiose. Oh, and they’re all over Lv100. Your first foray here sees you getting absolutely wrecked by a gang of over-levelled Mankeys. If you’re not already at or around Lv100, you’re going to really struggle, and thus the grind begins. Your goal now is to research Hyperspace Lumiose, use donuts to open hyperspace rifts, jumping in and doing three of a limited pool of missions. Pick up 10 shiny items, destroy 5 floating Poké Balls, catch 3 Pokémon, etc. The kicker is that you have a very short mission timer based on the quality of the donut you used, meaning that you have to work fast to finish the randomly generated map. Within each pocket you will find three different Pokémon, two of which you’re likely to have already, and the third being something unique to the DLC’s hyperspace Pokédex. Finding and catching these new Pokémon is, of course, exciting. It’s a little rough though that you fight them at over Lv100 and they’re reduced all the way back to Lv20 when you catch them. Sure, a lot of the thrill of Pokémon is in the chase, but when your Lv100 Feraligatr needs to use multiple attacks to take them down, you want to catch a Pokémon with some of its bulk remaining. Do enough research and you unlock the boss fight — a brand new mega evolution to call your own. These fights can be incredibly tough. While it’s 3-on-1, rather than the 2-on-1 of the base game, you still have the mission timer, alongside the fact that these things hit like a truck (no surprise when you’re fighting a creature at Lv140). Sure, your donuts give you a temporary level boost, but you’re not going to be matching their level. Fortunately, if you run out of time you can simply pick up where you left off with zero penalty, removing the difficulty of the actual boss fight. It’s obvious why this is the case — the game is tough as nails in these fights — but to me it underscores that the developers knew how frustrating these could be. Beat the boss and you unlock a new tier of pocket dimension, offering more Pokémon of higher difficulties, as you might expect having played the main game. Outside of this gameplay loop, what else does the DLC offer? There’s a string of new side missions using the new Pokémon you caught, but other than that, not much. So… is Mega Dimension good? Honestly, it feels like it would have been post-game content a generation or two ago, rather than a paid DLC. We’re no strangers to the grind in the world of Pokémon, but I’m struggling to find a time when the struggle felt like such a chore. The idea of randomly generated dungeons is cool, but we need a less intense timer and more variety (and colour) inside each one. Doing the same missions again and again in order to get to the next boss (and eventually the chance to try to find a Legendary Pokémon) gets a bit stale, pretty quickly. If you miss the chance to catch the Legendary, it’s worse still. The difficulty spike could also benefit from being toned down a notch.",2025-12-23T13:34:25+00:00,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-review/,en,0.41340482234954834
Vince Zampella has died following a car crash,"Vince Zampella has died in a car crash, as has been confirmed by EA after initial reporting by NBC Los Angeles . According to the reports, Vince Zampella and a passenger were travelling along the Southern California’s Angeles Crest Highway in a Ferrari when the car came off the road and hit a concrete barrier, ejecting one of the passengers from the car while the other was trapped in the vehicle which caught fire, dying at the scene. The ejected passenger died of their injuries at the hospital. Vince Zampella has been a hugely influential figure in the games industry and is credited as one of the major creators behind Call of Duty, having founded Infinity Ward, releasing Call of Duty 2, and the breakout hit of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare which catapulted the series to being a household name. This was followed by Modern Warfare 2. Vince was fired from Infinity Ward by Activision along with Jason West, going on to form Respawn Entertainment, releasing Titanfall, Titanfall 2, Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. In 2020, Vince was put in charge of DICE Los Angeles and then in 2021 the entire Battlefield series. Leading tributes from studios, companies and people he worked for and alongside, EA issued the following statement to IGN : This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come. Our thoughts are with Vince’s loved ones.

Cronos: The New Dawn is getting an easier Temporal Diver Mode difficulty,"Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn is going to get a new Temporal Diver Mode, which will allow players to experience the game on an easier difficulty. Not much more detail has been given regarding exactly what this will do in terms of gameplay, with Bloober Team confirming more details will be provided in early 2026. A trailer for the Temporal Diver Mode has been released. Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people. Cronos: The New Dawn Review – Such is our calling In our Cronos: The New Dawn review, Steve said, “Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future.

The intriguing narrative, the enjoyable progression, and the challenging combat all combine to make an experience that cements Bloober’s place as horror specialists.” Source: YouTube",2025-12-22T20:41:25+00:00,Aran Suddi,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/22/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-getting-an-easier-temporal-diver-mode-difficulty/,en,0.7416005730628967

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Strategy & Simulation Game,"The first rule that you learn in business school is probably that you need to make sure to file your taxes on time, and while I’m sure there’s management games out there that do force you to do that, I’m rather glad that most strategy and business sims take a more lax approach. That really lets you focus instead on making your dreams come true, to see the birth of a nation and its rise to dominance, to build the very best museum for ghosts, to guide customers to their perfect book, and to hatch little baby dinos. All of which lead us to our winner… When I was younger I had two loves, the Jurassic Park film and the Zoo Tycoon video game. Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that later in life, Frontier would combine both of my biggest fandoms into one glorious park-builder video game where the player gets to create their own unique dinosaur theme park on an island just like Isla Nublar. What can I say? Life finds a way. What’s more, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is the best iteration yet. It refines and enhances every aspect of the previous two games, whilst also adding in new features like natural dinosaur breeding and improved terrain tools to keep things fresh. Whether it’s protecting the park from devious hackers or delighting your guests with exciting new tour options, Jurassic World Evolution 3 brings us a vibrant and fully realised simulation. It goes deep into the park management genre whilst still providing an accessible strategic experience that will delight old-school fans and newcomers alike. Also, there’s nothing better than adorable baby dinos. – Laura Europa Universalis V – Runner Up Releasing a new game in any big and well-supported strategy or management series is a bit like reading up on the endless sequence of patricide in Greek mythology. It’s not so much the rest of the genre that a new game has to compete with, but all the years of updates and expansions that went before. For a game like Europa Universalis V , it had to compete with and succeed a game that was over a decade old! But that provided Paradox Tinto with a huge opportunity to return to the game’s foundations, to reconsider many aspects of how things like population, government control and influence, market dynamics and wars all work. Importantly, they managed to do this while also still keeping a lot of the breadth and detail that had built up for EU4. There’s still plenty of room for expansion, but where it’s easy for a 1.0 launch to stutter and stumble, EU5 gets off to a great start. Two Point Museum – Runner Up If there’s one thing you know you’re going to get with a Two Point game, it’s bad puns, and if there’s a second thing, then it’s a charming management sim that’s been adapted to each new setting. From hospitals and universities, you now find yourself in charge of the museums of Two Point County, dusting off relics and old bones, gathering unusual flora and underwater fauna, and looking to build the best exhibits to draw in as many inquisitive minds as possible. And hopefully they’ve got some loose change to make a donation or two!

"No Rest for the Wicked co-op update comes in January with persistent realms, but you can play the beta now","Moon Studios has revealed what’s in store for their ambitious action RPG No Rest for the Wicked and the addition of co-op multiplayer. The studio is forging a rather unique path compared to other top-down action RPGs and Soulslikes, with persistent realms you can share with other players. The No Rest for the Wicked co-op update will arrive on 22nd January in full, but is currently in an open beta on Steam . That beta has now been extended to conclude on 5th January , so you can play all through the holiday. So what’s the benefits and reason to Moon Studios’ approach? Well, as outlined in the latest dev diary, there’s a distinct lack of permanence to a multiplayer session in many Soulslikes, and shared online spaces in games like Diablo 4 and Destiny have little meaning to them, just other people running around. But there’s something special about having clanmates to hang out with in an MMO, and so No Rest for the Wicked is blending all of this together. No Rest for the Wicked will let you convert any single player realm into a multiplayer one, making it a fully online and persistent instance of the game world. Within this you can have up to four players, and you can share this space fully with characters tied to the realm, or bring characters in from other realms. Being persistent, you don’t need a host player to be online, and so anyone can hop in, harvest materials, level up their character, buy property, and go to complete main quests. That obviously means that you do need to have a trusting relationship with the other players in your realm. The video showcases some of the shenanigans you can get up to, as studio director Thomas Mahler buys up a ton of property through farming progress and then trying to flip the property to the others, and then those others getting a little bit of revenge. For the more moment-to-moment action, Moon Studio also outline how you can really work together in play, having front line character, ranged builds and healers that can be great for tackling an imposing boss together. At the same time, enemy AI has been adapted to understand more about player positioning, able to react to flanking moves, or exhibiting some new attacks that you won’t see in single player. For the game as a whole, vendors will now have fresh gear to sell cycling in and out of their shops. Enchantments have been overhauled and higher level items get better rolls – but you now have limited rerolls – while weapons can now deal crit damage, and have random Facets to provide different stats. Socketing gems will now give fixed improvements, but there’s now higher tier gems. Exhalting (a bit like prestiging an item) needs you to have completely maxed out your item first, boosting a random item in a particular category multiple times. All enemies are now back-stabbable in combat (if you’re good enough), and bows have been enhanced with a new off-hand Quiver to introduce different arrow types (like blasting, explosive arrows). Oh, and for the high difficulty sickos out there, the highest difficulty now has more enemies than before. The game has come through a difficult year, with Moon Studios having to split off from publisher Private Division and go it solo , and with Mahler having a weird moment on social media . Since entering Early Access in early 2024, progress has also been steady as opposed to blistering, but with a big update earlier this year , and now the imminent addition of multiplayer (which will certainly have been a mountain to overcome), the future for this game is rather encouraging. No Rest for the Wicked is out now in Steam Early Access, with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions planned for when it’s good and ready.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Original Soundtrack,"Music really has become a huge part of modern gaming, the best examples not just elevating the game as you play it, but sticking with you as the original compositions lodge themselves in your mind to emerge while you’re doing the dishes, waiting in line at the supermarket or other incongruous moments. The difficulty with game music is just how varied it is. There’s sweeping orchestral scores, there’s jazzy chip tunes, there’s songs, there’s ambient music, regional influence and soundtracks that look to encompass hundreds of years of history. For us, as we tried to consume as many soundtracks as we could this year, there were some clear standouts, but we had to pick one. Of all the great video game music created this year, Ghost of Yotei’s really hits the high notes – this lacklustre pun absolutely intended. Composed by Toma Otowa, a multi-award-winning film and video game composer, the sweeping and beautiful compositions that accompany the player bring to life the world of Ghost of Yotei through a rich and culturally textured score. What sets Tomo’s work apart for Ghost of Yotei is the attention to detail, seamlessly blending traditional Japanese instruments (like shamisen, shakuhachi, biwa, and Ainu instruments such as tonkori and mukkuri) with Western influences. There’s even a delightful smattering of spaghetti western-style elements to the score, a perfect fit for the revenge story of protagonist Atsu. Overall, a unique cultural fusion is blended, managing to complement the bombastic gore-soaked action whilst also providing the quiet melancholy that underpins the sorrow-tinged beats of Atsu’s emotional journey. – Ade Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up It’s rare that I listen to a game’s soundtrack when I’m not actively playing the game, but then again Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a rare game. If you were to listen to the somber, melancholly of “Gustave” or the beautiful violins of “Firecamp – Sciel,” you might be surprised later when you hear “In Lumiere’s Name,” a tango for a battle with a mime, or “Is it a Gestral or a Volleyball?” which is at least as silly as it sounds. They could be from completely different games – though both French, obviously. Or perhaps the epic distorted guitars of “Une vie à peindre” would be more of a surprise? Much like the rest it, the soundtrack of Expedition 33 is emotional, whimsical, silly, heavy, and French all at once. The soundtrack is as varied as it could possibly be, from slow, morosely beautiful, smaller tracks perfect for the dramatic brooding over the most recent unbelievable revelations, all the way up to the huge heavy hitting boss battles that really get your heart pounding when you need to try and keep focused on parrying and dodging. Frankly, it’s a delight all the way through. It’s clear that composer Lorien Testard poured a lot of love into this soundtrack and it shows as, truly, one of the best I’ve experienced ever. – Gamoc Skate Story – Runner Up How do you soundtrack a game about a glass skateboarding demon on their way to eat the moon? If you’re Sam Eng and you’re making Skate Story , you draft in an entire indie band and let them loose on your gorgeous, existential exploration of the underworld. There’s a lot of leeway in what that might sound like, but with the neon, crystal-infused, ephemeral visuals, it made sense to bring electronica, synth, and a retro-modern outlook that speaks to the 1980s as much as it does the 2020s. This is a true album too. Skate Story Vol.1 is an auditory journey that’s as essential as the game it soundtracks, and you’ll find yourself travelling back to the half-places and looming edifices of the demon’s journey as you sink ever further into Blood Cultures’ retro-pop. – Dom Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) Europa Universalis 5 Fresh Tracks South of Midnight That’s this weekend’s awards wrapped up.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Multiplayer Game,"2025 has been a huge year for multiplayer gaming. From big budget sequels in major franchises, to emerging genres like the extraction shooter breaking into the mainstream, and smaller, more experimental indie games, there’s been a little bit of everything for everyone to enjoy – so long as you enjoy other people, I guess. So, of all the headline-grabbing multiplayer games, both expected and unexpected, which came out on top? When Lethal Company exploded in popularity back in 2023, it triggered a major shift in the culture around multiplayer gaming – competitive argument-simulators like Jackbox and Among Us remain popular, but a new crop of games focused on chaotic co-op shenanigans emerged out of the woodwork. PEAK represents not only the best of that new genre we playfully refer to as “friendslop” – it represents the most fun you can have with a new multiplayer game this year, and it’s a major achievement in online gaming. The concept is simple: it’s a co-op game about climbing, and if you and your three friends have to try to scale the massive multi-biome summit laid out before you. Fail to do so and your run is over. The fluid, physics-based absurdity of the game generates a million laughs a minute, but even in downtime and defeat there’s fun to be had. The game smartly lets dead players not just spectate the remaining crew, but float around as adorable ghosts, berate the surviving climbers, and even get in their face and distract them a little bit. It’s a wonderful blend of friendsloppy chaos and genuinely well-designed systems that has made it the best multiplayer that money can buy in 2025. – Miguel Mario Kart World – Runner Up How do you follow up from near perfection? It’s a problem that you could argue Nintendo has faced many times over the decades, but was definitely true for creating a sequel to Mario Kart 8 . That kart racer had sat atop the genre for a decade, presiding over both Wii U and Nintendo Switch as the best-selling game, and being exceptionally well supported with DLC through the years. So how do you top that? Well, you don’t, really. You turn right and just go for a drive through the countryside for a while. Going open world is a huge part of what makes Mario Kart World feel new and different. In addition to having the many themed race circuits, they’re all joined up by a network of roads and environments that you can also race through – OK, that you have to race through because Nintendo decided to put really emphasise this. With larger lobbies, wider roads and more items, Mario Kart World is even more of a light party game than before. But then there’s the Knockout Tour, the Battle Royale racing mode that features huge map-wide races, eliminates players at regular intervals, and builds up to a real pressure moment to survive to the very end. It’s a lot of chaotic fun, perhaps a touch too chaotic, and with Nintendo’s typical quirks like not letting you party up for matchmaking (that they’ve thankfully tweaked in patches), but it remains an essential purchase for any Nintendo Switch 2 owner. Battlefield 6 – Runner Up 2025 was the year that Battlefield finally, well and truly, stuck it to Call of Duty . EA placed a huge bet in assembling a collective Battlefield Studios around DICE, and while some parts of Battlefield 6 have been a miss, the core multiplayer brings back a lot of the tone, feel and action that defined this series through the early 2010s. 64-player matches, defined classes, vehicular warfare are all here, and it’s great to get back to basics alongside some new and inventive game modes. Through launch and its first season, the main complaints to lodge against Battlefield 6 have been a lack of large-scale maps that defined this franchise, and Battlefield Studios’ annoying tinkering to shorten match lengths and reduce player counts, and (of course) some rather silly looking skins in the battle pass, and then backtrack when the community complains that this is stupid and not what they want. But the core is still there, and we hope that 2026 sees Battlefield Studios build and grow around that.

REPO’s next update will let you use a walkie talkie,"REPO has given been one final development update before the year is up, and developer Semiwork has listened to the feedback of what a lot of players wanted. Yes, players will be able use a walkie talkie to communicate when the next REPO update is released. Additionally, there will also be a leaf blower so you can blow away enemies and allies alike. The walkie talkie and leaf blower will not be the only things coming to REPO in its next update. Semiwork has confirmed that it will be overhauling the in game shop with a new visual design and new features including an Upgrade Re-Roller that lets you re-roll upgrades for a fee. The team is also working on improving vehicles and making them more intuitive to use across the maps. One of the changes will include adding drifting to the semiscooter. There was also confirmation that Semiwork is targeting 2026 to release REPO into version 1.0. R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract & Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.

"The Division – yes, the first one – gets a PS5 update","Ubisoft have released version 1.23 of The Division, a game released ten years ago and superseded by the cunningly named The Division 2. The new patch does absolutely nothing apart from give PS5 players a 60fps mode. That’s it, nothing else, just a nice 60fps update for the *checks notes* five people still playing the game on PS5. The Division Heartland was meant to be the next game in the series but was cancelled by Ubisoft in 2024, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to IGN . The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects. That didn’t work out too well as XDefiant, Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter, officially shut down on June 3, 2025, just over a year after its May 2024 launch. Since then Ubisoft have been busy restructuring their business, starting by selling off five games to Atari, the games being Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. They have also delayed all their “big” games to allow them to be more polished, although they did not say which games these were, They have also been cuddling up with Tencent to create a subsidiary that will look after three of it’s biggest franchises, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry..

Greedfall: The Dying World is on the right track but still has a way to go,"It’s often said that you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, but this is precisely what developers Spiders are hoping to do with the most recent overhaul to their prequel to the cult favourite RPG, Greedfall . When it first launched in Early Access late last year the initial response was fairly negative, with many players left confused by its title suggesting a sequel, and many others left underwhelmed by the switch to a tactical turn-based combat system. To their credit, Spiders took this criticism on board and suspended their proposed roadmap in order to address the most pressing issues raised by players. I got the chance to have a hands-on look at the most recent build and can report that it is definitely improving. First up, I have to confess that my time with the new build was not the most optimal of experiences, playng remotely and with my connection suffering from frame rate drops and technical issues. I’m obviously looking past these hiccups, but it did mean that I didn’t really get to enjoy some of the later parts of the demo. That being said, I got to see enough to be cautiously optimistic that The Dying World can find an appreciative audience. The demo build contained three main areas for me to explore, with the opening section and two saves at crucial later parts in the story. The opening section of the game plays out similarly to the original version, with you playing the role as a native Teer Fradee. You get to familiarise yourself with the basic mechanics and immerse yourself in the traditions and beliefs of the tribes before coming into conflict with the colonial forces that are just starting to exploit the land. This introduction works well as a tutorial and my second time experiencing it highlighted the more streamlined and intuitive combat system. The most important change here is that you can now control your companions in a far more traditional style and queue up attacks to take advantage of their skills and abilities. Each character and class has a distinct set of skills, but it looks like you can diversify or specialise to your heart’s content as you level up. The setting and atmosphere of The Dying World are one of the real highlights as there is a rich and detailed sense of world-building here. Reams of optional lore and conversation choices are available for those who want to explore as much as they can and the game is not shy in highlighting the contrasts between the tribal traditions and the colonial powers that invade. This contrast comes into direct conflict at the end of the opening section and your player character is thrust into an entirely new environment. The two later sections showed different areas and recruited companions that really emphasised the game’s focus on cultural conflict and exchange. Each companion seemed to have an interesting set of characteristics and motivation for joining your adventure. Obviously the finer details were not available as I was thrust into the middle of quests and storylines, but it left me intrigued as to how the story would develop. Deeper into the game, combat felt more developed as the characters were appropriately levelled and had more abilities to balance and tactical approaches to take. The final section in the demo saw me return to the lands in which you grew up and this seems to suggest a clear connection between the conclusion of this game and the world of Greedfall. Unfortunately it was here that my connection to the stream became untenable, but in retrospect this wasn’t a bad thing since it leaves me itching to find out how the story develops. All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.",2025-12-19T16:00:18+00:00,Steve C,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/greedfall-the-dying-world-is-on-the-right-track-but-still-has-a-way-to-go/,en,0.979183554649353
Game of the Year 2025 – Best Independent,"The indie game scene is where you will always find the more experimental titles that big publishers may not feel comfortable funding. It is such a vibrant scene that allows smaller teams and individuals to really go all out. There were a number of outstanding independent games released in 2025, and it was tough to decide on a top three, especially with how muddy the waters can be when trying to determine what counts as “indie” and not, but having made our decision, it’s time to lick the stamp and send it. After coming up as runner up in our Best Narrative Award, Dispatch has taken the crown to be the best Independent game of 2025. It blends great classic Telltale like storytelling with an excellent visual presentation, and fun superhero management gameplay. AdHoc Studio’s debut title has managed to set a new bar for episodic games, the likes of which we have really not seen for years. Dispatch manages to take a rather normal segments of life, office politics and a dispatcher job, and turn them on their heads to provide a fun spin. Office politics are a lot harder to handle when you are dealing with beings that could cause you all sorts of problems without breaking a sweat. AdHoc has managed something many studios have struggled to do in the past, and that is balance fun gameplay with a great story, and a memorable look. Hades II – Runner Up It would be remiss of us not to have the sequel to our Best Independent Game 2020 winner as part of this list. While it can be argued that Hades II does not quite meet the same heights as the original Hades, very few games could do that. What we have in Hades II is a stellar sequel which saw resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths, and a more mechanically involved combat system all added to expand the system. Hades II also brought us a new protagonist, Melinoe, and a story which sees the Titans declare war on Mount Olympus. Everything is absolutely solid in Hades II and it is only that the story was slightly less engaging than the original for why this has game has not climbed to the top of our Best Independent mountain. Hades II didn’t beat what many consider the perfect game, but it came near close to matching its predecessor. Ball X Pit – Runner Up Ball X Pit is what you would call a mad mashup of ideas that works really well. Developed by Kenny Sun and some friends, it takes brick breaking, base building, and ball attacks to mix it all up into one of the most entertaining roguelikes of the year. It is a fast paced and intense experience with balls flying everywhere as you fight off waves of monsters. Balls can be fused to make new ball loadouts that have various effects, and you also need to rebuild Ballbylon so you can get even more power ups in your fight to beat the monsters. Ball X Pit is a game that is very hard to put down once you have started your run, the action and need for quick thinking definitely grabbing your attention. Add in the colourful and bold action on the screen with the engrossing gameplay, Ball X Pit is an indie game that has captured a huge audience that just want to unload their balls. Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) Cloverpit Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo Hollow Knight: Silksong Phew! That’s a pretty big one out of the way.

Mintrocket reveals new details for Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC,"Mintrocket has released a new developer diary to mark the end of the 2025, with game director Jaeho Hwang giving details on what has been happening at the studio and what to expect going forward. We get a look at Mintrocket’s new office, but the main area of concentration is Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC which is due out in early 2026. Dave The Diver Into The Jungle is expected to have around 10 hours of new content for players to experience in the jungle village of Utara. Here Dave can spend his day helping villagers with their requests, or gathering fruit and minerals. If that doesn’t take Dave’s fancy there’s a new restaurant to visit that is run by Bancho. Here Dave can help serve multiple customers, with these customers being people Dave has built relationships with. The restaurant is not called Bancho Sushi, as the fish in the freshwater lake cannot be served like that, so instead the restaurant is Bancho Grill. When Dave The Diver goes diving in the jungle lake he will have to watch out for threats like crocodile, catfish, electric eels, and piranhas. However, Dave is not an easy snack for these predators as he comes armed with the new Jungle Gun, which has multiple forms including shotgun, netgun, sniper rifle, and a regular gun depending on the danger. On land, Dave can wander the jungle with friends and experience different jungle themed minigames including what seems to be a guitar hero style rhythm game. In addition, there has been confirmation there will be guest characters from other games in the Into The Jungle DLC, but Mintrocket has not said who. Furthermore, Mintrocket has announced it has partnered with XD to bring Dave The Diver to mobile devices. The mobile version is not going to be a straight port of Dave The Diver, with the UI and controls redesigned for the mobile experience. Dave The Diver Mobile will be released in China first with a global release to follow soon afterwards.

"Cleared Hot Chapter 1a is out now, adding the RAH-66 Comanche","Not Knowing Software has released Chapter 1a for Cleared Hot, its take on the classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The major addition as part of the Chapter 1a release is a brand new helicopter, the RAH-66 Comanche, which is an agile craft but is susceptible to taking damage rather quickly. That is not the only addition, with a new test flight area, and more fixes. Plus Cleared Hot is now confirmed as Steam Deck Verified. Cleared Hot Chapter 1a update Survival Mode This area has a handful of small mini-game modes that we are exploring. In survival mode you defend a building from waves of enemies, with health and ammo dropped in between waves. You get a cash reward for reaching the half way point and for completing the stage. Defense Simulation This just sends waves of enemies straight at a target. The enemies don’t progress and there is no ending. Standoff Range Spawns both friendly and enemy NPCs and sends them into a battle. Other Areas There are a lot of other areas for you to play with. Demolition Playground Physics Playground Standoff Range Shooting Range Vehicle Range Turret Range Radar Turret Range New Options Screen Shake – You can now adjust how much screen shake is applied (in game options) No Blood / Gore / BBQ Meat – You can now disable blood and gore. The NPCs will no longer explode into various cuts of meat after being killed by rotors or certain weapons. Active Debris Limit – Added a slider for the maximum number of physics debris pieces that can be active at a time. Lowering this will help performance in certain CPU bound situations, or really destruction heavy levels. UI FPS Limit – We’ve added an option to limit your FPS while in the game UI, to prevent melting any graphics cards unnecesarily :) Cloud Save -We also added cloud save. So you can keep synced between your various devices. Keep in mind that with the current implementation, the game syncs on quit.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Puzzle Game,"As Dr. Kawashima’s low polycount face reminded us all in the early 2000s, working out the brain is important to keep it sharp, and there’s one genre that works out your brain more than others. At least you would hope so, and that is the puzzle genre. The puzzle genre is wide in scope, with experiences that range from simply putting pieces together to other experiences where you need a notebook to write down everything so you can refer back them as things get more complicated. Our winner is definitely on the complex side of the puzzle genre. Blue Prince is a massive achievement in the puzzle genre, providing an experience that just has so many layers to it. What seems to be a simple premise of finding a way to a secret room in a mansion, eventually spirals into a major multiroom and multirun experience where anything in the environment could be a clue for something else. Blue Prince is a game that has spawned whole communities working together to figure out the different conundrums that pop up, from uncovering switches to open new areas, to working out what certain objects across different rooms actually mean and deciphering their importance. Blue Prince is the ultimate puzzle game of 2025, and it will be one that confounds new players for years to come. Lumines Arise – Runner Up Enhance and Tetsuya Mizuguchi have seemingly made it their mission to make games about making blocks disappear in a sense overloading explosive celebration. The team smashed it out of the park with Tetris Effect in 2018 and has now shifted focus back to Mizuguchi’s own Lumines to revolutionise it for a new generation. Lumines Arise takes the puzzle element of building up your score by repeatedly forming blocks of matching colour, and presents it in such a way that you become utterly engrossed in the action. Lumines Arise is a stunning audio and visual package which doesn’t just provide an environment in which to solve the puzzles, but pulls you to be enveloped by music and art which are as essential to each puzzle as the blocks themselves. Lumines Arise is proof that puzzle games can be some of the most breath-taking games imaginable. Is This Seat Taken? – Runner Up One of the biggest social challenges we face pretty early on in life is finding a place to sit, be it at school or family gatherings. Choosing a seat is more than just finding a comfortable place to plonk yourself, it determines who you could be interacting with for the duration of being seated. And what if you sit somewhere when the person already sitting there wants to be left alone? Is This Seat Taken? takes that situation and makes a game of putting people in the correct seats while they go on a journey. Is This Seat Taken? is a nice and simple premise that creates ever increasing challenges as you figure out where people should be seated, while keeping everyone happy. If you have ever done a seating plan for a party or wedding, you know how difficult that is. The game gives you different issues to deal with. Someone might be very chatty and want to sit with someone who will indulge them in conversation, while someone else might be a bit smelly so hardly anyone wants to sit by them, and some people will want to be left alone. While not the most difficult of puzzle games Is This Seat Taken is certainly unique, taking a relatively normal part of human life and turning it into an engaging experience.

Neon Inferno Review – The new run ‘n’ gun king,"If you’ve been gaming for as long as I have, there’s now a period of your gaming life that falls into the ‘classical’ era. The 8-bit and 16-bit consoles forged gaming as we know it today, with 2D sprites and burgeoning 3D techniques transporting us to worlds we’d previously only imagined. Zenovia Interactive want you to remember those days, with their latest title, Neon Inferno, set to revitalise the 2D run ‘n’ gun genre, while leaning on modern technology to make this one of the best-looking side scrollers of recent years. Angelo Morano and Mariana Vitti are assassins waging a war for The Family. This conflict has you facing off against the Yakuza and the corrupt NYPD, working your way through the enforcers and low-level cops, on your way to the people at the top. As a run ‘n’ gun game, the overarching gameplay is instantly recognisable: run from left to right, shooting in eight directions, while ducking and jumping out of the way of the blizzard of incoming bullets. Neon Inferno has a keen eye for where to update the classic tropes, though, adding in a slick parry ability that sends bullets hurtling back to where they’ve come from, as well as an all-new feature that lets you fight on two planes. You’ve got one standard button for shooting, while the secondary one shifts your focus to the back of the screen, altering the gameplay to a shooting gallery. You move your reticle around to dispatch all the villainous bad guys, and it becomes a real challenge shifting focus back and forth between the two. It’s a clever idea, not only breathing new life into the genre, but taking familiar concepts and merging them into something new. Well, new-ish. Layered on top of that is bullet time. Using your ability to parry bullets, you can then hold the button down and enter a slow-motion state where you can utterly redirect those bullets in any direction you want. These redirected bullets also deal more damage, so it becomes a crucial technique in your arsenal, slowing the action, and sending bullets careening around towards different enemies. Where Terminator 2D: No Fate aims to be a ‘lost’ licensed game from the era, Neon Inferno takes the classic run ‘n’ gun form and gives it a modern refresh, throwing a variety of gameplay mechanics in, and somehow, making them work as a cohesive whole. The different stage ideas are effortlessly cool, with early highlights including a motorcycle chase, and a club battle where civilians are getting in the way, leading to a showdown on a smoke-filled dancefloor. These consistent, exciting shifts give Neon Inferno a cinematic, action-packed feel. It’s all just so damn stylish. The animation and art direction are absolutely brilliant, with Cyberpunk vibes and neon-infused 2D styling that riff on elements of Streets of Rage , all the way through to Cyberpunk 2077 . It perfectly ties in with the engaging, if straightforward, storytelling, digging deeper into the criminal underworld you’re part of. I love the way it’s undoubtedly fooling you into thinking this is how games used to be, but while I can categorically say that they weren’t, there are perfect nods and callbacks to games of yesteryear. Add in the energetic soundtrack from Gonzalo Varela and Qwesta, which blends old-school Blade Runner synth tones and sax with aggressive guitar riffs and the occasional high-quality vocal, and you’ve got one of the most surprising games of the year. It is fair to say that Neon Inferno isn’t messing around. The standard difficulty selection is on Hard by default, and this gives you fewer checkpoints and lets you take fewer hits, making sure you don’t misunderstand how tough games like this used to be. There are two easier-going options, for those who want to experience the game without the risk of snapping your controller in half. The middle option gives you a decent challenge, without feeling unfair.",2025-12-18T16:20:08+00:00,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/neon-inferno-review-the-new-run-n-gun-king/,en,0.6107968688011169
Helldivers Movie Lands Fast & Furious Director Justin Lin,"Helldivers is preparing to launch a dropship to a theater near you via an upcoming film adaptation, and it just landed a big-time director. Justin Lin, best known for directing several installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, will helm the project. Per The Hollywood Reporter , the Helldivers movie comes from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with Justin Lin’s Perfect Storm Entertainment helping produce. Lin’s credits include directing most of the installments in the Fast & Furious series, starting with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and continuing with Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), F9 (2021), and Fast X (2023). According to THR ’s sources, Lin is not a gamer and is leveraging this in his pitch to “find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.” The script for Helldivers is penned by Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the It and Annabelle franchises, as well as The Nun . Dauberman also wrote this year’s Until Dawn , so Helldivers will be his second video game adaptation. Helldivers 2 Given that Helldivers is essentially a video game version of the cult classic film Starship Troopers , turning it into a movie does feel like the snake eating its tail. Helldivers centers on soldiers hailing from Super Earth, an uber-patriotic managed democracy, who defend the planet in an intergalactic war against alien bugs, as well as killer robots and other threats. The first game was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, and Helldivers 2 arrived on PlayStation 5 in 2024 to widespread acclaim and popularity. The Helldivers movie does not have a specific release date or window. In the meantime, check out our reviews for Helldivers and Helldivers 2 .

Paramount Announces A New 'Sonic Universe' Film For Holiday 2028,"Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel. Per Deadline , all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively. Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4 , scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it’s not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion. Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ Knuckles series? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Game Director David Grivel Rejoins Splinter Cell Remake After Leaving In Late 2022,"It's been nearly four years since Ubisoft announced its Splinter Cell remake , but the developer doesn't have much to show off quite yet, outside of a few pieces of concept art . Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA. “Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I’m rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!” Grivel’s LinkedIn post announcing the news reads . “A very special team and project to me,” the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji. (Thanks to GamesRadar , which noticed this post before we did. ) According to his LinkedIn profile, Grivel worked at Ubisoft from 2011 to 2022, spending most of his time at the Toronto offices as a senior or lead game designer, with credits on projects like Assassin’s Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, 6, and Primal, and most importantly, Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting. Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it’s unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it’s a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here’s hoping we’ll see a more concrete update sometime soon.

Dragon Quest Reimagined Producer On Remaking A Classic: 'We Rebuilt Everything From The Ground Up',"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the latest game to grace the cover of Game Informer , and to learn more about this game for the cover story, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to play two hours of the game and interview the team behind it, too. With this being the second remake of Dragon Quest VII, following the 2016 Nintendo 3DS remake, I was curious about where you even start with a project like this.&nbsp; So I asked producer Takeshi Ichikawa and director Masato Yagi about their thought processes behind developing the game, which elements are sacred ground in Dragon Quest VII, if there’s any pressure involved, and more. Here’s what I learned. “To be honest, I did feel some pressure, but for the most part, I felt the same as Ichikawa here,” Yagi tells me. “I was excited with the idea of bringing these new changes.” Ichikawa, on the other hand, didn’t feel much pressure. “I was certainly excited with the prospect of bringing these changes,” he tells me. “When we first kicked off the project, we had in mind three main components that we really wanted to reimagine for this version; the first one being the visuals, the second one being the scenario or the story, and the third one being the battle. […] It is one of the most popular installments in the series, but our goal was to offer a reimagined experience to players all around the world. But again, I didn’t really necessarily feel pressure.” When I ask where the team started with Reimagined, Ichikawa explains it’s a remake focused on showcasing what makes Dragon Quest VII so great to modern audiences. That means keeping the story intact, although lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi explained to me in a different interview how the team streamlined the main scenario; you can read about that here . “I really thought that the story of the original was essential to keep,” Ichikawa says. “When you look at [all of the] mainline installments, Dragon Quest VII’s story is quite unique and not really like the others. These characters […] go through a lot of struggles, and it is, overall, kind of a bit darker. That [darkness] is the one thing that I wanted to retain for sure in the remake.” Yagi agrees with Ichikawa, telling me in a series full of lighthearted stories with a more loving tone, Dragon Quest VII is darker. He remembers asking, “Is this actually a Dragon Quest story?” while playing the original game on PlayStation. Retaining this tone was important for Reimagined, he adds, lightly dipping into spoiler territory to discuss Prince Kiefer, a party member of the game. I won’t spoil anything here, but if you’re familiar with the game, Kiefer makes a crucial decision in the story, and though in the initial stages of development the team pondered keeping it (and other narrative moments) in the game, it remained. “That’s definitely one thing that we were debating if we should keep or not, but in the end, we decided it’s just too essential for the story,” Yagi says. “There are a lot of areas where we debated to keep or not keep, but in the end, for the most part, we decided to keep [things in place]. But it’s not keeping them as is. We did end up making some little adjustments and arrangements here and there.” Speaking more broadly, Yagi says the team behind Reimagined “really wanted to make the overall game experience more immersive for our players [and that’s why we streamlined the story. It’s also why we made some adjustments to the combat.” Closing out our conversation on the philosophy behind this remake, Ichikawa tells me, “Reimagined” implies everything is new. He says, “We really built everything from the ground up. We rebuilt everything, aside from the scenario, from scratch. In order to convey that sentiment, we felt that ‘Reimagined’ would be the most adequate title instead of ‘Remake.'” Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.

Bungie Shares Deep Dive On Star Wars-Inspired Destiny 2: Renegades,"Bungie today offered a deep dive look at the new Destiny 2: Renegades release, which is scheduled to arrive for players next week, on December 2. The new major release for the game is an unusual one, as it’s rooted in a partnership with Star Wars. A quick look through the early visuals of the game don’t leave much room for doubt on that, as there are lots of things that look like lightsabers, stormtroopers, and villainous Sith. But as today’s vidoc makes clear, Bungie is trying to thread a more nuanced line with this release that it first appears. While plenty of features may look like Star Wars, the team is going to great pains to make sure it remains a true and canon Destiny experience. Those aren’t lightsabers but rather Praxic Blades. Those aren’t stormtroopers but instead members of the surging Barant Imperium. And that’s not a Sith – it’s a dangerous new big bad named Dredgen Bael. Whether the developer can pull off keeping those distinctions or not will be a matter to decide once we can play the game, but the early descriptions and footage offer good reason to be excited. The storyline appears to focus strongly on Drifter as a central character, acting as a conduit into some of the criminal underworld of the solar system. With his scoundrel demeanor, Drifter pretty clearly nods a bit toward characters like Han Solo in the Star Wars fiction. We also get to know a character that has been mentioned in the past in written lore entries for Destiny. Aunor Mahal is about as close as the game is likely to have to a Jedi, with her Praxic Blade that she is using to fight against Dredgen Bael. Players will pledge to a faction and build up reputation as they fight across the Lawless Frontier, an explorable space with a dedicated social hub in the form of Tharsis Outpost. Factions include the anarchist Eliksni biker gang called The Pikers, the group of sentient Vex call the Tharsis Reformation, and the rogue Cabal called Totality Division. You’ll run jobs for these factions like smuggling, bounty hunts, and sabotage-focused missions. While Aunor is shown in some pretty slick lightsaber-esque battles, NPCs aren’t the only people getting fun new Star Wars-themed toys to play with. Players will also be able to wield Praxic Blades, and will even be able to try out different fighting styles, very much like a Jedi. With the exotic primary, kinetic Praxic Blade, you can deflect attacks, melee attack enemies, and even throw. And, just to set clear expectations, Bungie has shared that the Praxic Blade won’t be unique to this content drop; it will continue to be a relevant weapon in future expansions to the game. Renegades also introduces new Blasters inspired by Star Wars, including several distinct variants, from dynamic blasters that hit harder with brute force, to more fast-firing balanced blasters. Blasters overheat and must cool down, rather than have a traditional magazine reload. We also learned about a special solar exotic crossbow called Heirloom, inspired by Chewbacca’s weapon in the movies. Players will also be able to pick up different “renegade abilities,” that seem in some way to tie together with the faction you work for. Across all the new content Bungie showed off today, one of the features that stood out the most was the music. By drawing direct inspiration from the Star Wars scores, arguably some of the most extensively varied and beloved of all film music, the new Destiny themes that were part of this preview presentation were, quite simply, riveting. The Renegades experience may be worth returning to play if only to hear more of that great music in action. There’s plenty more to learn in the complete rundown. Check out the full vidoc below to get a comprehensive look at what Bungie is cooking up. Destiny 2 continues its march into the future with Renegades on December 2.

"Yuji Horii On Final Fantasy: 'When I First Saw Final Fantasy X, I Recall Feeling This Was The Ultimate Perfection'","Dragon Quest launched in Japan in 1986, and a little over a year later, Final Fantasy launched in 1987. Though the two are now sister RPG franchises at Square Enix, before the 2003 merger between Square and Enix, these series were competitors. And if you ask fans, they might use a word like rivals.&nbsp; I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, last month to visit Square Enix’s Shibuya offices, play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined , and interview the team behind the remake for Game Informer’s latest cover story . But as part of this trip, I interviewed Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii for 90 minutes about all kinds of topics, including the aforementioned competition between his franchise and Final Fantasy. He didn’t call it “competition,” as I did, but admits, “I was definitely paying attention to it.” “Way back then, when Final Fantasy originally came out, I was definitely paying attention to it because it was something we needed to look out for,” Horii tells me. “But there’s one key difference that I really saw back then: the protagonists in the Final Fantasy titles, they speak a lot. Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves. “In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you’re not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games. So I thought that was a really interesting and stark difference between Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, but I didn’t necessarily see them as a rival back then.” Horii says in Dragon Quest, protagonists don’t “just start talking on their own.” “Final Fantasy, again, [the protagonists] just talk a lot,” he continues. “I do like Final Fantasy, though. When I first saw Final Fantasy X, I recall feeling this was the ultimate perfection of Final Fantasy.” Great taste, Horii. Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.

FX Announces Far Cry Anthology Series Coming To Hulu From Alien: Earth And It's Always Sunny Creators,"FX is developing an anthology TV series adapting Ubisoft’s Far Cry franchise. The upcoming show will stream on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally. According to a press release, the series will “retain Far Cry’s signature standalone storytelling format” and each season will take place in a new setting and star a different cast. Far Cry is being helmed by executive producers Noah Hawley, creator of FX’s Fargo and Alien: Earth , and Rob Mac (formerly McElhenney after a legal name change this summer), creator of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia . Mac, who also co-wrote and stars in the FX docuseries Welcome to Wrexham and Apple TV’s Mythic Quest, will join the cast of Far Cry in the starring role. “What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley in a press release. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.” “Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” said Rob Mac in a press release. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.” Far Cry 6 Far Cry ’s executive producer credits also include names from various production companies, such as Emilia Serrano (26 Keys), Nick Frenkel (3 Arts), Jackie Cohn (More Better), and John Campisi. Ubisoft Film & Television executives Gerard Guillemot, John Campisi, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill are also involved. FX’s Far Cry has no premiere date or announced cast besides Rob Mac. Whether it’s the 2010 Prince of Persia film or the 2016 Assassin’s Creed film, Ubisoft has never been shy about bringing its franchises to the big and small screens. Far Cry already has a TV show to its name in the form of 2023’s Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix , an adaptation of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. There is also the terrible 2008 Uwe Boll Far Cry film, but perhaps that is best forgotten. Other recent Ubisoft adaptations include a live-action Assassin’s Creed series currently in development by Netflix, and the animated show Splinter Cell: Deathwatch , which premiered on Netflix in October, is nominated for a Best Adaptation trophy for this year’s Game Awards . For more on Far Cry, you can read our review of its most recent entry, 2021’s Far Cry 6, here .

Can PS1 Controllers Work On PS2?,"With PlayStation, Sony introduced a revolutionary way to enjoy games that were now in full 3D and featured huge FMV cutscenes for a more cinematic experience. To navigate through this exciting new world gamers used the brand-new controller that had a D-pad with 4 face buttons (X, square, triangle, circle). It even had triggers for your middle fingers, something that every prior controller had lacked. But can PS1 controllers work on PS2? Yes, they will work on PS2 because both PS1 and PS2 controllers share the same port and basic control layout. Because PS2 uses a PS1 CPU as its I/O chip, it can perfectly read inputs from a PS1 controller and can even read PS1 memory cards . If you connect your PS1 controller to a PS2, make sure you’re not using it for a game that requires the DualShock. If the game doesn’t need analog sticks, you can play it just fine with a PS1 controller. Another thing to remember is that the PS1 controller doesn’t have pressure-sensitive buttons, while the DualShock does. PS1 Controller vs PS2 Controller If you open up both controllers you’ll see that they share much of the same basic circuitry with two exceptions. Firstly, the DualShock has two analog sticks and rumble motors. Secondly, it has pressure-sensitive buttons that are used by a small group of games such as Gran Turismo. What this means is that you can control the throttle and brake in Gran Turismo using just the X and square button rather than the right analog stick. This feature didn’t stick around for too long because it had more downsides than upsides. For example, people often found themselves slowing down in racing games just because they slightly lifted off on the X button. These days, the only pressure-sensitive parts of a controller are the triggers (L2 and R2). PlayStation 1’s controller had none of these fancy features, it didn’t have a rumble motor or analog sticks. Yet, games were designed around these limitations until the upgrade controller with analog sticks arrived in 1997. You don’t have to do anything special to make a PS1 controller work on PS2. Just plug it in like a DualShock and insert your PS1 disc into the tray. PS2 can also read PS1 memory cards (these will only work with PS1 games, not with PS2 games). Is A PS2 Controller Compatible With A PS1? Here’s the fun part- not only does a PS1 controller work flawlessly on PS2, but a PS2 controller will also work flawlessly on PS1. Because the controllers are so similar in how they process and send inputs, you can use them on either console. Just keep in mind the fact that many PS2 games require analog sticks so you can’t play them with a PS1 controller. What Controllers Work On A PS2? In addition to PS1 and DualShock controllers, PS2 can also support a small group of third-party controllers. The Logitech Wireless Action Controller is officially licensed and built quite well. You can also purchase modern 3 rd party controllers for your PS2, such as this one from Blue Lake Performance. Do PS1 Controllers Work On PS3? The DualShock 3 works perfectly for playing PS1 games on PS3, but you can’t use the original PS1 controllers. PS3 has USB ports rather than the old controller ports, which are used primarily for charging the wireless DualShock 3. If you want, you can purchase an adapter that makes PS1/ PS2 controllers work on PS3. Which PS2 Model Plays PS1 Games? All of them, because PS2’s I/O chip is just a PS1 CPU. Normally this works as a controller for the front ports, DVD drive, rear expansion slot, etc. But if a PS1 disc is detected, this I/O chip switches into backward compatibility mode. Did PS1 Have Joysticks? Not originally, but it got upgraded controllers in 1997 called Dual Analog. Eventually, this developed into the DualShock which would be used on PlayStation 2. Because Sony hadn’t quite figured out a durable enough rumble system, they removed rumble from the European and American releases of the Dual Analog controller. Thankfully, this feature was put back into DualShock for PS2. Conclusion I hope this article helped you understand more about the backward compatibility of PS2 with PS1 controllers. You can connect a PS1 controller to a PS2 as long as the game doesn’t require a DualShock. Some games even use the pressure-sensitive buttons of DualShock 2 and won’t work with a regular DualShock. For those who aren’t aware, the DualShock is an improved version of the Dual Analog controller that was originally released in 1997 for PS1. It added rumble, and the DualShock 2 is a DualShock with pressure-sensitive face buttons. Because it uses the same protocol as a PS1 controller, a PS2 controller can be connected to the PS1.

Yetimhane Öyküleri: Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles Steam’de Çıktı,"Pugsy Studios imzalı 4-kişilik co-op korku oyunu Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles, Steam Erken Erişim’de çıktı. Gerçek hikâyelerden esinlenen oyunda yanmış bir yetimhanede ruhların kim olduğunu tespit ediyoruz. İsterseniz tek başınıza, isterseniz de arkadaşlarınızla oynayabileceğiniz Lost Lullabies’da temel döngüyü zenginleştiren birçok teçhizat ve atlatması güç korku dolu anlar var. Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles nasıl bir oyun? Lost Lullabies, bizleri Lowell kasabasına götürüyor. Kasaba ile aynı isimdeki yetimhane ise ürkütücü hikâyeler ve olaylar ile çevrili. Bu yetimhane, çocukların işkence gördüğü ve acımasız deneylere tabi tutulduğu kötü bir şöhrete sahip. Lost Lullabies da öyküsünü bu konsept üzerine kuruyor. 1960 yılında gizemli bir şekilde yanarak kül olan yetimhane 1980 yılında dört arkadaşın burayı keşfetmek istemesi ile yeniden ziyaret edilir. Bu ziyaret ile birlikte Lowell Yetimhanesi’nin sırları bir bir açığa çıkar. Ruhların peşinde! Lost Lullabies: The Orphanage Chronicles’ın temel oynanış döngüsü yetimhanede kol gezen hayaletleri bulmak üzerine kurulu. Oyuncular çeşitli ekipmanlardan yardım alarak, Lowell Yetimhanesi’ni mesken tutan ruhları durdurmak için öncelikle ruhların geçmişlerini öğrenmesi gerekiyor. Hayaletlerin geçmişine dair detayları bulmak için de bulmacalar çözmeli ve parçaları birleştirmek gerek. Ancak her yanan ve terk edilen binada olduğu gibi Lowell Yetimhanesi’nde de kötücül ruhlar var. Dolayısıyla Lost Lullabies’da iyi hayaletleri kurtarırken kötücül ruhlarla da mücadele etmek lazım. Hayaletlerin türünü belirlemek için çeşitli bir ekipman havuzu da mevcut. Toplamda 24 adet farklı ekipman bulunuyor ve bunlar sayesinde doğru hayaleti bulmaya çalışıyoruz. Ayrıca bu oyunda bir ses etkileşimi de bulunuyor. Hayaletler mikrofonunuzdan aldığı sese göre tepki veriyor ki bu da son dönem korku oyunlarındaki atmosferi daha üst seviyeye taşıyan bir mekanik. Çıkardığınız her ses, sizi ruhlar için bir hedef haline getirebilir. Korku bu kadar güzel görünmemişti Pugsy Studios imzalı Lost Lullabies grafik açısından da odlukça güçlü. Özellikle yetimhane içindeki bazı anlar gerçekten görsel şölen diyebiliriz.

Bungie Veteran Joseph Cross Appears to No Longer Be Marathon’s Franchise Art Director [UPDATE],"Bungie veteran Joseph Cross appears to have stepped away as Marathon’s Franchise Art Director, based on recent LinkedIn and social media changes. Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has slowly been finding its footing again after a rocky year . The studio released a new 22-minute ViDoc giving us a much cleaner, more polished look at the game, along with new dev updates on what’s changed since the early Closed Alpha test. Bungie is now targeting a March 2026 release window for the game. Following its gameplay reveal earlier this year, the game faced heavy criticism from parts of the community, with fans asking for features like proximity chat, solo play, and improved visuals . Bungie has confirmed that proximity chat and solo play option are coming to Marathon, and we already saw a much better look at the exterior environments in the new ViDoc. Image: Bungie Related: Court Dismisses Ex-Marathon Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit Against Bungie and Sony But Marathon hasn’t had an easy road since its gameplay reveal earlier this year. The biggest controversy came from the art theft situation , where 1:1 design assets were found in the alpha build of the game that had been used without permission from independent artist Antireal (4nt1r34l). Bungie publicly acknowledged and apologized for the issue at the time, and Antireal later said the dispute has been resolved to her satisfaction . Now, there is a new development that has caught the attention of fans. Joseph Cross Appears to No Longer Be Marathon’s Franchise Art Director It appears that longtime Bungie veteran Joseph Cross may no longer be serving as Marathon’s Franchise Art Director, or may have left Bungie entirely. This information comes from changes spotted on Cross’ LinkedIn profile, where his role as Senior Art Director at Bungie is listed as ending (or ended) sometime in 2025. Cross had held that position since 2018, which is around when Marathon entered development. His long tenure made him one of the key creative figures tied to the project. In addition to LinkedIn, Cross’ public social media presence has also changed. Earlier this year, his X profile bio listed him as “Franchise Art Director, Marathon @ Bungie .” That wording has since been updated to a broader description that reads “Art Director & Artist – Marathon. Dune. Destiny…” with no direct mention of Bungie or a specific leadership role. Update, December 18, 2:03 PM PT: After our report, Kotaku’s Ethan Gach reached out to Joseph Cross. Cross confirmed he left Bungie by choice. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” Cross said. Image: X | LinkedIn via The Game Post Related: Destiny 2 Leak Reveals Marathon Crossover Armor Sets and Cosmetics This does not fully confirm that Joseph Cross has left Bungie. It is also possible that he has simply moved into a different position within the studio or stepped away from the Marathon project while remaining at Bungie in another role. The Game Post has reached out to both Joseph Cross and Bungie for comment. We will update this story if we receive a response. As for Marathon itself, Bungie recently announced several changes aimed at addressing player feedback, including improvements to visual clarity, emphasis on “dark sci-fi world” building, and new social features like proximity chat. Image: Bungie Related: Alberto Mielgo defends the Marathon cinematic as “not AI,” denies his team touched Bungie’s plagiarized material and calls the art theft incident a genuine mistake that was “blown out of proportion” What do you think about this potential leadership change and Marathon’s road to release?

"Sony vs Tencent ‘Horizon Clone’ Lawsuit Over Light of Motiram Ends in Settlement, Game Delisted From Storefronts","Sony and Tencent have reached a confidential settlement to end the Light of Motiram “Horizon clone” lawsuit, and it looks like the game has now been delisted from major PC storefronts. Sony and Tencent’s legal battle over Light of Motiram , a game Sony previously described as a Horizon lookalike, appears to have reached its end. The lawsuit, filed by Sony Interactive Entertainment in late July 2025 in a California federal court, accused Tencent and its subsidiaries of copying major elements from the Horizon series, including its world, characters, and overall presentation. Over the last few months, the case turned into a back-and-forth about what counts as inspiration versus copying. Sony pushed hard for an order to stop the game from moving forward, while Tencent ’s side argued Sony was trying to lock up common ideas and style choices in the genre. Image: Tencent | Polaris Quest Related: Tencent pushes to throw out Sony’s Light of Motiram lawsuit, saying it’s “based on future conduct that has not, and may never occur,” and arguing that “fame does not create a trademark” as Sony “fails to identify Aloy’s appearance as a trademark outside the game” Just two weeks ago , things still looked like they were headed toward a bigger showdown in early 2026. The two sides even agreed, on paper, that Tencent would pause promotion and public tests while the legal schedule played out, with the idea that major issues could be heard together in January. Then came a surprising new development. In a new court filing submitted earlier today and obtained by The Game Post , it appears the lawsuit is over. Sony and Tencent End the Light of Motiram Lawsuit According to the filing, Sony and Tencent jointly asked the court to dismiss the case under a rule that allows both sides to end a lawsuit by agreement . The document makes it clear that this decision follows a confidential settlement between all parties involved. The lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice. That means the case is closed for good , and the same claims cannot be brought back to court later. The filing also confirms that all pending motions have been withdrawn and that each side will cover its own legal costs. Here is the full statement from the court document: “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and the confidential settlement of all parties, Plaintiff Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC and Defendants Tencent America LLC, Proxima Beta U.S. LLC, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Proxima Beta PTE Ltd., and Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Company Ltd., by and through their undersigned counsel of record, hereby stipulate as follows: “All pending motions are withdrawn and this action is hereby dismissed with prejudice. All parties shall bear their own fees and costs.” Image: Tencent Related: After Sony’s ‘Horizon’ Knock-Off Lawsuit Against Tencent, Light of Motiram Dev Scrubs Store Page, Changing Game Description, Images, and Key Art There is no mention of how much money, if any, changed hands as part of the settlement. The terms are fully confidential, and this was the only court filing submitted today. For now, there is no public record that reveals the actual value of the deal or any specific conditions tied to it. Light of Motiram Gets Delisted from Storefronts Adding another layer to the story, Light of Motiram was also delisted from major storefronts earlier today , just before the court filing appeared. The game’s product pages on both Steam and the Epic Games Store were removed, making it unavailable to view or wishlist on either platform. At the time of writing, the Epic Games Store link leads to a 404 Page Not Found screen. And on Steam , the game’s product page no longer loads a normal product page and instead drops you back onto Steam’s main storefront. As things stand, the lawsuit is finished, the game is no longer listed on major stores, and many questions remain unanswered. Whether Light of Motiram will return in a different form, under a new name, or not at all is something only Tencent can clarify in the future.

PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR 2 Reportedly Doesn’t Have Frame Generation in the Plans,"A new rumor about PS5 Pro’s PSSR 2 says Sony isn’t planning frame generation. If you’ve been keeping an eye on PS5 Pro news, PSSR 2 has quickly become the big “next year” rumor . The recent leaks claim Sony is working on a major upgrade to its PSSR upscaling for 2026 , with a new approach that’s supposed to look cleaner while using less memory and less GPU time. The chatter also says it would need game updates, since it may rely on a new API instead of being a simple switch. Now, a new round of details has surfaced, and it focuses on one feature some people assumed was coming along for the ride: frame generation. Image: Sony Related: “It’s not some 0.5 upgrade, it’s huge”: New leak claims PS5 Pro will get “PSSR 2” in 2026 using “Multi-Frame Super Resolution 2” to cut memory use and GPU time PS5 Pro PSSR 2 rumor says no frame gen The new comments come from hardware leaker and insider, Moore’s Law Is Dead in a new Broken Silicon episode , where he says he’s relaying what he’s hearing from developer sources and backend documentation. When the discussion turned to frame generation for the next version of PSSR, he shared a message he says came from a source familiar with Sony’s tooling. Here’s what he said: “A source I was talking about this [PSSR 2], then I just asked, ‘is there any reference to frame gen?'” Apparently, the source replied, “not a single one in the next PSSR. I haven’t heard a single developer ask Sony to add Frame Gen to PSSR.” He then follows with:”“not only is Sony not working on it, but they know that developers hate it, hate it, hate it.” The claim is not that frame generation is impossible on PlayStation, but that Sony’s next PSSR 2 upgrade is being treated as an upscaling and image-quality project, not a frame-gen initiative. One possible reason is that frame generation can come with tradeoffs like artifacts and inconsistent motion. Image: Sony Related: New PlayStation 6 handheld leak claims Sony “needs” devs to support PS5 Low Power mode and “maintain 60 FPS by lowering resolutions” to get games ready for launch As for the bigger PSSR 2 package, the earlier rumor set is still the same. The leaks have described PSSR 2 as “MFSR2” internally, with goals like needing fewer inputs, reducing memory use, cutting GPU processing time, and improving image quality versus current PSSR. There’s also talk of Sony shipping better debugging tools for teams, including a replay tool to help track down PSSR artifacting issues. As always, take all of this with a grain of salt. None of it is confirmed by Sony, and “developer sources” can mean anything from early notes to outdated plans. On the PS6 handheld side, the latest rumor says Sony’s new PS5 Power Saver push could be more than just saving electricity . In this same episode, Moore’s Law Is Dead claims a source told him Sony has patched every PS5 dev SDK back to version 1.0 so studios can add Power Saver support even on older builds, and that Sony is treating this as a bigger internal priority than PS5 Pro-specific work. He also points to a CPU optimization doc that allegedly hints at more Low Power modes coming, and says games should be able to run on only 8 CPU threads. The idea is that if PS5 games can reliably run in a lower-power profile, it becomes much easier to carry them over to the rumored PS6 handheld without every game needing a painful custom rewrite. Image: Sony | TCMFGames Related: PlayStation Leak Hints at “Cross-Buy” Feature, Possibly Between PS5, PC, and Rumored PS6 Handheld What do you think? Would you rather Sony focus on making PSSR 2 cleaner and cheaper to run, or do you want frame generation in the mix too?",2025-12-16T19:16:25+00:00,Abdullah Jawad,The Game Post,https://thegamepost.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-frame-generation-isnt-plan/,en,0.4345076084136963

Destiny 2 offers an expansive universe filled with numerous activities for players to explore, but none are as challenging or rewarding as raids and dungeons. Raids in Destiny 2 are six-player cooperative missions that often span multiple encounters, each with unique mechanics and bosses. Dungeons, on the other hand, are typically three-player activities that offer a similar level of complexity and reward structure but on a smaller scale. They blend the difficulty of raids with the accessibility of smaller fireteams, providing a perfect middle ground for players who might not have a full team of six.

Defeat Nexus Princess Ky'veza Before Pre-Patch Removes Guaranteed Rewards,"Blizzard has updated the 12.0 PTR to include a change to Let Me Solo Her: Nexus-Princess Ky'veza: the achievement to defeat ?? Ky'veza will only be obtainable until the launch of Midnight Pre-Patch, January 20th, instead of ""the launch of the next season of Delves"", as stated previously. Defeat Nexus-Princess Ky'veza in her lair on Tier ?? without any other players in your party, before the release of the next season of delves.Midnight Pre-Patch. This achievement awards the player with the Delver's Mana-Skimmer Schematic: Hyperdrive transformation for your Delver's Mana-Skimmer and has been available since the beginning of Season 3. If you are looking to complete ?? Ky'veza and earn this transformation for your mount, you only have about a month left from the publication of this article, as the Midnight Pre-Patch arrives on January 20th (US) / January 21st (EU). While not affected by this update right now, it is fair to assume that Pruning the Princess will also be limited to the Pre-Patch launch date. This means that if you want to obtain the title, you should do so before Pre-Patch arrives. Earning Hyperdrive Customization After Midnight While the achievement won't ever be obtainable again, you will likely still be able to obtain Delver's Mana-Skimmer Schematic: Hyperdrive in the future.

Blizzard Needs to Make Diablo 4's Sanctification System Permanent,"Season 11 is well underway, the holidays are here, leaderboards are coming soon, and there's a new expansion on the way. There's a lot to look forward to going into the new year for Diablo, but Sanctification is one system that hasn't been announced as a core feature going into the base game. If Blizzard wants to give players a richer itemization, build diversity, and endgame longevity, Sancification needs to stay going forward. Diablo 4's Itemization Problems Gear in Diablo 4 comes in three core flavors: Legendaries, Uniques, and Mythics, but realistically, there isn't much in terms of choice for these items, and the core changes to Tempering and Masterworking in Season have only made them less interesting by removing variance and individuality from gear. For any given build, there is a set of enabling uniques that must be used, full stop. As an example, Death Trap Rogues not equipping Scoundrel's Leathers or Eyes in the Dark would not just make the build worse, it would make the build entirely unplayable. These item slots are essentially ""locked"" for each build, with no alternatives available. Similarly, Mythics share the same fate. Items such as Harlequin Crest, Shroud of False Death, and Ring of Starless Skies have become staples of many builds, or in the case of Starless Skies, sometimes even build-enabling through the resource cost reduction. With Uniques and Mythics, it is normal, almost expected, that 4-5 item slots are pre-determined, locked in powers with no diversion. In terms of variance and inter-build diversity, gear progression, power-scaling, and even endgame grinds, that only leaves Legendaries to do the heavy lifting of the entire gear system. And yet, Legendaries suffer much the same fate as Uniques and Mythics, with aspects like Vehement Brawler's Aspect being required parts of builds as well. From top to bottom, Diablo 4's gearing is dictated and pre-determined not by gear, but by the guaranteed effects on them. Sanctification as a Solution to Diablo 4's Gearing This is where Sanctification comes in. With the numerous outcomes available to the system, double aspect items, sanctified affixes and more, item slots are no longer ""finished"" the moment a required piece of the puzzle drops. Gear with Sanctification is more individual, enables gear decisions if certain aspects or mythic powers are added, and gives players something to gamble and work towards. Chasing that perfect piece of gear is one of the great joys of any ARPG, and the base game without Sanctification doesn't have the itemization depth to enable that chase. For the good of the game, Sanctification has to become a core system starting with Season 12.",2025-12-24T13:01:22+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379768/blizzard-needs-to-make-diablo-4s-sanctification-system-permanent,en,0.55977863073349

From the Ilidari Dreadstalker to the Arcberry Manasaber, there are lots of mounts here to add to your stables. If you’re missing mounts from Legion, this is also a great time to get some rarer or unobtainable mounts like the Gul’dan Infernals or the Violet Spellwing, the old AOTC mount. Naxt Victim: This achievement is near impossible on live servers, but is much easier on Legion Remix with people farming the Sentinax. If you want this achievement, head over to the Sentinax now and click here for more details. Balance of Power: The Balance of Power quest chain is much easier in Legion Remix.

Warlocks Can Now Unlock the Power of Fel Magic in Mists of Pandaria Classic,"Warlocks, masters of the Fel, have long wanted a way to make their fire spells match the energies they harness and wield in combat. In the original release of Mists of Pandaria, a new questline was introduced to reward players with this unique customization. Isle of Thunder Zone Guide Much like the Benediction questline for Priests, or the Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers challenges for Hunters back in Classic, the The Codex of Xerrath questline for Warlocks in Mists of Pandaria (now returning in Mists of Pandaria Classic) will challenge you to make full use of the Warlock class' kit and utility, and require quite a bit of skill (and a bit of luck) to succeed. Starting the quest You'll begin your quest by looting a Sealed Tome of the Lost Legion from rare mobs in the Isle of Thunder. The drop rate for the tome is relatively low, but with some persistence, you can score one eventually. If you're not inclined to grind, you may also find it at your local Auction House. Keep in mind that the tome is only lootable by Warlocks, and any Warlock that tags an Isle of Thunder rare can potentially loot it, but only one tome drops per rare, and only one Warlock will get it from that kill (the loot is pre-assigned, so it doesn't matter how fast you loot the corpse; only the assigned Warlock will be able to see it or loot it). Look for Jubeka's Mark at the entrance of the Black Temple to start the final Scenario. Once you obtain it, you should be able to follow the questline, which starts with An Unusual Tome. As you follow the chain (no spoilers here, sorry!), you will learn about the mysterious Council of the Black Harvest, and ultimately travel to the Black Temple, Illidan's former seat of power. The Solo Challenge The last quest, Infiltrating the Black Temple leads you to one of WoW's most memorable solo challenges: Kanrethad Ebonlocke. This encounter is more about proper execution than it is about raw item level, as Kanrethad has a lot of abilities that need to be reacted to, and proper use of your skills is required to succeed. ""Say hello to my little friend!"" While obviously a higher item level (closer to 522+ at least) will make the fight easier, it is definitely possible to complete it with an item level as low as 489 and even lower. It is advised that if you're trying this at a lower item level, to bring plenty of combat consumables (flasks, food, potions) and a few Purification Potions to deal with Kanrethad's Curse of Ultimate Doom if it comes to that (this is the fight's ""enrage"" timer). Power! Unlimited (Fel) Power As a reward for your efforts, once you defeat and banish the infamous Leader of the Black Harvest, you'll be able to learn The Codex of Xerrath, which has various cosmetic effects that are better experienced than spoiled. While the changes are more obvious to Destruction players (as they have more Fire spells), every specialization will see changes in its spells. Should you wish to go back to a life of non-green fire (and really, who would want that?), you'll find Jubeka Shadowbreaker in Shadowmoon Valley, where she can rid you of the Fel awesomeness burden for the low sum of . Should you wish to become awesome tainted by Fel magic again, simply interact with the banished Kanrethad. Did you defeat Kanrethad in the original Mists of Pandaria release or in MoP Classic? How many attempts did it take?

Corruption of the Aspects - Twelve Days of Mounts: Day 4,"Welcome to day four of our special Twelve Days of Mounts series, 2025 edition!

The War Within Mount Guide Corruption of the Aspects Corruption of the Aspects is an easy mount to collect from Revisited Horrific Visions. It is sold by Torie, the Revisited Horrific Visions quartermaster in Dornogal, for 40,000 Displaced Corrupted Mementos. Note that you must complete the achievement We Have the Memories before being able to purchase it. Horrific Visions Revisited Horrific Visions returned in Patch 11.1.5, with a new set of cosmetics to unlock. To enter these new visions, you must head to Dornogal, next to the Coreway: Horrific Visions Hub If you're soloing this, you'll need to progress through Visions to unlock its tech tree. If you haven't, you can learn about that process here. After unlocking the whole tech tree, the only thing left is to farm Corrupted Mementos to purchase your mount, which will take you a few extra Horrific Visions runs, depending on how many Masks you're running. More Masks will award you with more Mementos, but will make the runs more deadly and dangerous. However, with Season 3 gearing, it shouldn't be too bad.

"Blizzard, Where Is The Festive Housing Decor?","The Holidays are fast approaching, and decorations have gone up all around the world. For player housing, however, the Winter Veil Tree is missing. With the Winter Veil Tree datamined weeks ago, it stood to reason that holiday decor would become available before Christmas, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. Christmas is just a few days away, Winter Veil is well underway in-game, but it remains unknown how to obtain the special tree. Festive holiday decor would be a great addition to player housing. It could be used to celebrate everything from birthdays with special cakes to Christmas or even more regional holidays, such as the 4th of July, which could have outdoor fireworks. At the end of the day, if festive decorations are going to work, Blizzard needs to give players their decorations in advance, rather than after the fact, when all the festivities are already over. Where is the Winter Veil Tree? The most likely source for the tree is as a present under Greatfather Winter's tree, which can be opened starting December 25th. This does however make for a bit of an awkward timing, as players would be receiving holiday decorations after the holidays. Some more outlandish ideas for the tree's drop source include it being part of the endeavour system or being added to a vendor via a hotfix, both of which seem unlikely given that Winter Veil Tree is named after Winter Veil. Getting Creative for Christmas Players instead have resorted to making their own trees, such as Reddit User Lexiconn, who spent a whole afternoon setting up a massive tree in their main room. Lexiconn made sure to include all the details in their tree, including presents! Sadly for players that aren't willing to spend hours making a tree from scratch, Blizzard has provided very little in the way of information regarding the Winter Veil Tree decor item.",2025-12-23T04:58:21+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379765/blizzard-where-is-the-festive-housing-decor,en,0.8483279943466187

This rare has a chance to spawn during S.C.R.A.P. jobs in Undermine, namely when the job hits 500/500 tracking. Scrap Jobs Scrap digging is an activity unlocked in Undermine, starting with Renown 3 with the Cartels of Undermine. Note that you don't need to unlock it to obtain this mount, as it is a drop for the rare. You need to unlock it to help summon the rare, however. Once you go through the tutorial quest, you can start doing S.C.R.A.P. Jobs in Undermine. To locate them, look at the Undermine world map for trash icons. Once you find one, head to the area and speak with the NPC in the area, Carlo Greasegrind, to start a job. Once a job starts, you have 2 minutes to dig through as much trash as possible! Digging trash will give you a new currency, Empty Kaja'Cola Can. As you dig, you will face enemies that will distract you and require killing, hazards that require dodging or kicking, and more. While farming for this mount, you'll likely earn many Empty Kaja'Cola Can from doing the scrap digs. These can be traded with Angelo Rustbin at the Undermine Sanitation building in Hovel Hill for other items like toys or pets, or even for a bag that has a chance of containing a mount. You can learn more in our Scrap Digging guide. Day 1: Personalized Goblin S.C.R.A.P.per Day 2: Darkfuse Spy-Eye Day 3: Gazillionaires Flying Machine Day 4: Corruption of the Aspects Day 5: ? Day 6: ?

Even More Buffs Coming to Arms Warrior on China's Titan Reforged Server,"Blizzard and NetEase have announced additional changes to Arms Warrior on China's Titan Reforged server. These changes are intended to improve the attack speed scaling and overall damage output for Arms Warriors. Restoration Druid Healing Buffs Massive Buffs to Arms Warrior After the weekly maintenance on December 25, we will be making the following adjustments to Arms Warriors on the Titan Reforged server: Time: Warrior Changes Arms: Wrecking Crew Damage bonus increased to 4/8/12/16/20% (up from 3/6/9/12/15%) Blood Frenzy Attack speed bonus increased to 10/20% (up from 5/10%) Bladestorm Now deals 115% weapon damage (down from 125%) Can now hit up to 6 targets Deals 30% additional damage to the nearest target. This results in a total of 149.5% weapon damage to the nearest target Developer’s Notes: The goal of these changes is to improve attack speed scaling and overall damage output for Arms Warriors, while also giving Bladestorm greater flexibility so it can effectively serve both single-target and multi-target scenarios. To achieve this, we increased Bladestorm’s target cap while slightly reducing its base damage coefficient, and introduced a key new mechanic: Bladestorm now deals additional damage to the nearest target. With these adjustments, Bladestorm should feel more impactful in both single-target and AoE combat, without becoming overly dominant in multi-target situations. It also introduces an interesting positional decision for the Warriors—standing closer to a priority target to deal increased damage.

New House Levels and Rewards Datamined - Increased Decor Budgets and Medium-Size Exteriors,"With Housing being all the craze on live servers right now, it seems that Blizzard isn't quite done with its features for Midnight. We've datamined brand-new Housing levels, with rewards that expand decor budgets and introduce new medium-size house exteriors! New House Level Rewards Level: NEW 7 Name: Room and Decor Placement Budget Bonuses Description: Gain an additional 10 Room Placement Budget and 500 Decor Placement Budget at this level. Level: NEW 8 Name: Medium-Size House Exteriors Description: You may now use medium-size house exteriors for your house. Level: NEW 9 Name: Room and Decor Placement Budget Bonuses Description: Gain an additional 10 Room Placement Budget and 500 Decor Placement Budget at this level. What does this mean? First, it means that Blizzard is still actively tweaking Housing for its actual launch with Midnight. These new rewards mean expanded possibilities for interiors while hinting at changes coming for exteriors, as we hadn't heard of medium-size house exteriors until now. This change might mean new exterior-exclusive decor or options to make decor larger when used in exteriors, meaning you wouldn't need to use all your budget in rocks when building a cave, for instance. However, this is pure speculation.",2025-12-21T06:10:54+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379677/new-house-levels-and-rewards-datamined-increased-decor-budgets-and-medium-size,en,0.9183467030525208

Platinum Challenge Mode Season 2 Rewards - Mists of Pandaria Classic,"If you found that Challenge Modes weren't quite challenging enough when MoP Classic launched, you might enjoy the updates that came with Phase 3. While there was no actual increase in difficulty, there are now rewards for completing the Challenge Modes in even faster times than Gold. Challenge Mode Rewards Guide Platinum Achievements & Toys Before you say ""an achievement isn't really a reward"", let's just clarify that the achievements come with a toy. If you complete the Temple of the Jade Serpent Challenge Mode dungeon in Platinum time, you will earn the Temple of the Jade Serpent: Platinum achievement, which also comes with the Platinum Boots of Expeditious Retreat toy. Dungeon Achievement Toy Temple of the Jade Serpent: Platinum Platinum Boots of Expeditious Retreat Stormstout Brewery: Platinum Platinum ""Little Ale"" Gate of the Setting Sun: Platinum Platinum Rod of Ambershaping Shado-Pan Monastery: Platinum Platinum Potion of Invisibility Siege of Niuzao Temple: Platinum Platinum Amber Mogu'shan Palace: Platinum Platinum Battle Horn Scholomance: Platinum Platinum Vial of Polyformic Acid Scarlet Halls: Platinum Platinum Battle Banner Scarlet Monastery: Platinum Platinum Sacrificial Dagger Each dungeon rewards its own unique toy, and these toys can only be used inside Challenge Mode dungeons. Most of these toys are versions of commonly used items in Challenge Modes, such as the rocket boots linked above, or the Platinum Potion of Invisibility. Platinum Coins: Mounts, Pets, Toys, & Transmog In addition to an achievement, completing a Challenge Mode dungeon in Platinum time will earn you 3 Platinum Coins. Important to note, you earn coins every time you complete a dungeon in Platinum time, not just the first time. Item Type Price Eye of the Legion Pet 5 Platinum Coins Instant Statue Pedestal Toy 5 Platinum Coins Demon Hunter's Aspect Toy 5 Platinum Coins Swift Yak Pelt Toy 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Ashen Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Crimson Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Violet Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Emerald Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Magic Rooster Egg Mount 0 Platinum Coins Wooly White Rhino Mount 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of Brilliance Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of the Void Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of Fury Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Recolored Challenge Mode Pieces Transmog 5 Platinum Coins Per Piece 0 Platinum Coins Full Set These coins can then be used to buy mounts, tabards, toys, a pet, and recolored versions of the original Gold Challenge Mode sets. The mounts consist of two previously TCG-exclusive mounts, the Magic Rooster Egg and Wooly White Rhino, as well as all of the Silver Challenge Mode Phoenix mounts. The tabards, toys, and pets are also all previously TCG-exclusive items. Jaelof Ironhart To purchase all items you will need 465 coins (only counting 3 Phoenix mounts, since you will have earned one of them from the Silver achievement, and only one recolored transmog set), which means you would need to complete 155 Challenge Mode dungeons in Platinum time. Viktor Felhallow Alliance NPC on the top, Horde NPC on the bottom. The vendors are located in the faction Shrines, and they are Jaelof Ironhart for Alliance players, and Viktor Felhallow for the Horde. They are on the upper levels of the Shrines. Season 2 Rewards In addition to these Platinum awards, there will be rewards for players who complete all Challenge Mode dungeons in an ""exceptionally fast time"". While similar to arena titles, for example, this will not be a percentage of players, but rather a set time for each dungeon. The times have not yet been announced, but the reward will be the Mistborne achievement, which comes with the title, and the Reins of the Black Kor'kron Proto-drake mount. Please note, in the database the achievement currently lists the Reins of the Celestial Riding Serpent as the mount reward, but in a recent news post it was announced that it has been replaced by the Reins of the Black Kor'kron Proto-drake. The mount is a previously unavailable recolor of the Reins of Galakras. Do these updates and new rewards make you more interested in Challenge Mode dungeons?

Farm the Highmountain Paragon Decor in Legion Remix Before it Gets Harder,"Players have discovered an interior decor banner that only comes from Highmountain paragon reputation caches. Luckily, farming this reputation is easy with Legion Remix! For more information about Housing Decor available from Legion or exclusive Legion Remix decor, check out our dedicated guides covering all you need to know. Broken Isles Decor Farming Decor Farming in Legion Remix Farming Legion Reputations in Remix Farming reputation, and thus the paragon caches associated with the Highmountain faction, is much easier with Legion Remix than it would be on the live version of the game. This is because of the Champion's Insignias that can drop from World Quests, Cache of Infinite Power, and more, which grant 2000 reputation to a given faction. Using these lets you farm reputation up very quickly. Bloodtotem Banner Housing Decor For those Tauren enjoyers out there, farming paragon caches with the Highmountain Faction has a 100% drop of the Bloodtotem Banner.

Best Infinite Power Farms in Legion Remix - Empower Your Timerunner,"With Legion Remix wrapping up after the holidays, let's take a look at some of the best ways to give your timerunner that extra oomph before the timeways collapse. Sentinax Farms Similar to Bronze Farms, Sentinax continues to reign supreme for raw Infinite Power grinds. Its main benefit being a farm that anyone can participate regardless of gear level. You can check our highlight in this standalone article, but the idea is to concentrate one group (ideally more) under the Sentinax and spam all its portals. You should use the group finder to find others interested in this farm, as there are usually a couple happening at all times. Note that, while rewarding, it can be a very boring farm. However, a good farm if you want to catch up on your favorite show or want to watch a new movie. Daily Raid Runs The og Infinite Power farm. While not a ""farm"" in the strict sense, it is still worthwhile to do. Farming raids daily has been a staple of Legion Remix, and it still rewards a plethora of Infinite Power every day, both from raw drops and from gathering 100s of Fragmented Memento of Epoch Challenges. While you can run each Legion raid once a day in each difficulty, for Infinite Power purposes, most players will stick with doing only Heroic and Mythic or only Mythic, as the gains reduce significantly on lower difficulties. Once again, Group Finder is your friend. There are hundreds of players running Legion raids daily, so even if you don't have the best geared character, you might be able to sneak into a run for Mythic raids. Mythic+ If you have a group of 3 to 5, Mythic+ might be the best way to farm for you. The idea here is to run lower keys that any of you can solo quickly and split-run them to complete it even faster. For instance, if you can solo +40, maybe try +30s for speed. The goal is to accumulate as many Fragmented Memento of Epoch Challenges as fast as you can from these keys. Remember to drop your key after each dungeon to keep the speedrun train going. The best keys for this method are keys like Eye of Azshara or Arcway that allow players to do bosses in any order, while keys like Darkheart Thicket or Neltharion's Lair don't really benefit from bringing more players along due to their linear design.",2025-12-19T21:00:08+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379725/best-infinite-power-farms-in-legion-remix-empower-your-timerunner,en,0.6037763953208923

Majority of Addon Changes Finalized for Midnight Pre-Patch - Whitelisted Spells Detailed,"Following up on the intent to loosen API restrictions shared earlier this week, Blizzard has released a list of whitelisted spells and API changes for the Midnight pre-patch, noting that the majority of future addon changes will be going into Patch 12.0.1 instead. These newly whitelisted spells are broken into two categories, with some being flagged to show just their cooldowns and others having all of their data visible. While all players can benefit from more easily customizing their Dragonriding ability's shared cooldowns, the change to Maelstrom Weapon and Void Metamorphosis information fills a critical informational hole for those specialization. These changes allow addons to track Maelstrom charges, a crucial aspect to playing Enhancement Shaman that isn't well supported by native tools. The other critical piece of information in this release is that the majority of future addon changes beyond those outlined below will be going into Patch 12.0.1, which launches a few weeks after the Pre-Patch. This means that players may need to find some creative solutions for issues not yet addressed as they re-customize their user interface, though the pre-patch is generally the best time for this transition, as players are also adjusting to other class, spec, and game-wide changes. Blizzard again! This week the first PTR build (PTR 1) for Midnight went up. As mentioned before, PTR is now 12.0.0 and all remaining Beta builds are 12.0.1. Below are the changes that are in PTR 1 that were not in Beta 5. It's important to note that ALL changes in PTR builds will also be in Beta, so expect to see these changes in Beta 6 as well when that goes up in January. After this build the majority of our addon changes will be going into 12.0.1 instead of 12.0.0 (we are very close to RC for 12.0.0) but there will be a few things that do go into 12.0.0 as well (mostly very high priority things). New Changes in PTR 1 (will also be in Beta 6) Whitelisting Select Spells The following spells have been flagged as having non-secret cooldowns: 425782 - Second Wind 372608 - Surge Forward 372610 - Skyward Ascent 403092 - Aerial Halt 361584 - Whirling Surge 418592 - Lightning Rush 460002 - Switch Flight Style 61304 - GCD Dummy Spell The following spells have been flagged as having non-secret aura data: 377234 - Thrill of the Skies 388367 - Ohn'ahra's Gusts 418590 - Static Charge 369968 - Skyriding Racing 344179 - Maelstrom Weapon 1217607 - Void Metamorphosis 1225789 - Void Metamorphosis (resource aura) 1227702 - Collapsing Star Combat Res Cooldowns All combat res spells now have non-secret cooldowns and charge counts. Reload UI & Secrets We have fixed an issue where secret values were made non-secret following a reload ui. Removing Old Duration APIs We have removed the follow APIs (addons should use the new Duration Object type instead from now on): C_ActionBar.GetActionCooldownRemaining, C_ActionBar.GetActionCooldownRemainingPercent C_Spell.GetSpellCooldownRemaining, C_Spell.GetSpellCooldownRemainingPercent C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDurationRemaining, C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDurationRemainingPercent Duration Object Utilities Added 2 new APIs to Duration Bbjects: EvaluateRemainingDuration(curve, modifier), EvaluateElapsedDuration(curve, modifier) Generic Boolean To Color APIs Added 2 new APIs (C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorFromBoolean and C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorValueFromBoolean) that can be used to convert a secret boolean to a color.",2025-12-19T17:05:50+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379738/majority-of-addon-changes-finalized-for-midnight-pre-patch-whitelisted-spells,en,0.7084975242614746

New Achievements Unlock Mounted Lumber Gathering on Midnight Beta,"As we continue to explore the Midnight beta, we've discovered some new Achievements that could make Lumber Gathering a whole lot easier. According to these new achievements, once a player gathers 250 Lumber from a specific continent, they will unlock the ability to Harvest Lumber while mounted in those Zones!
