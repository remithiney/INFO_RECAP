Our Favorite Games of 2025 (That Didn't Make Our Top 10),"There were so many good games this year that they couldn't all fit on GameSpot's Top 10, but that doesn't mean we're going to let them fade away and not be seen, or recognize, or talked about.

The Best Xbox Games Of 2025 According To Metacritic,"To say that Xbox had a busy 2025 would be an understatement. It was a year full of big game launches, strategy shifts, and several unpleasant surprises from Microsoft's gaming division in the form of price increases and mass layoffs. The main takeaway for Xbox in 2025 was consistency , as there was a steady feed of new games on PC and Xbox Series X|S from Xbox Game Studios alongside the launch of an expensive Xbox-branded handheld PC. But what does it mean to be an Xbox game in 2025? Microsoft doubled down on bringing its console exclusives to PlayStation 5, and many of those games were bestsellers on Sony's hardware. Doom: The Dark Ages, Gears of War: Reloaded, and The Outer Worlds 2 all had day-and-date launches on multiple platforms, and next year will see Microsoft's crown jewel, Halo, arrive on PS5. If an Xbox is the only console in your home, 2025 was still a great year overall for grabbing new games. From GOTY contenders like Blue Prince and Hollow Knight: Silksong to interesting third-party titles like Mullet MadJack and The Alters, there was no shortage of exciting games to grab. Many of them earned high review scores, and you can see which ones were critically acclaimed, thanks to some number-crunching by our sister site Metacritic. For a deep dive into the best of 2025, you can also read up on GameSpot's GOTY pick , the best Xbox exclusives , and the biggest news stories of the year . We've also got a running list of the best Xbox games and Game Pass games to play right now.

Not just a triumph of inventive gameplay, Split Fiction complements that experience with a tale about the power of human creativity. Metascore: 93 | Read our Split Fiction review Blue Prince Blue Prince captures you from the outset thanks to the mystery of the shifting manor. Clever puzzles and a dose of RNG can be initially frustrating, but as you progress through the game and uncover the deeper lore and secrets, that frustration dissipates to make room for satisfaction and awe. Blue Prince offers so much more depth than it appears to at first glance, and when you start to put the pieces together, you’ll be hooked. Metascore: 92 | Read our Blue Prince review Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 One of the best RPGs of the year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wows you with its stellar turn-based gameplay and breaks your heart with its elegantly melancholic storytelling. Innovative and beautiful to behold, Sandfall Interactive's debut game makes an incredible first impression. Metascore: 91 | Read our Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review Monster Hunter Wilds Capcom's previous Monster Hunter games have been terrific adventures, but Monster Hunter Wilds shows just how good the franchise's signature formula can be once all the friction has been removed from it. If you've been teetering on the edge and looking to play your first Monster Hunter game, Monster Hunter Wilds makes a strong case for the franchise with its polished gameplay and gripping story. Metascore: 90 | Read our Monster Hunter Wilds review Hollow Knight: Silksong Hollow Knight: Silksong more than lived up to the lofty expectations placed upon it by its eager fanbase, as the follow-up to 2017's Hollow Knight was pure metroidvania magic. Challenging and charming in equal measure, Team Cherry delivered an energetic sequel that could be ruthlessly difficult and incredibly satisfying when you overcame those obstacles. Metascore: 90 | Read our Hollow Knight: Silksong review Arc Raiders One of the best ""stories"" in video games this year was arguably Arc Raiders, which technically has little to no story, but the combination of its setting, lore, and player-to-player interactions have made it a fascinating storytelling vehicle, the likes of which rarely come around in games. Metascore: 88 | Read our Arc Raiders review Final Fantasy 16 One of the boldest reinventions of Final Fantasy since the franchise jumped from cartridge to CD-ROM, Final Fantasy 16 is a fascinating shift into new territory for the series. Featuring the darkest fantasy setting to date, gameplay that keeps you engaged with the battles on your screen, and several jaw-dropping boss fights, it's one of the all-time greats in the mainline series. Metascore: 88 | Read our Final Fantasy 16 review Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Being one of the longest games of the year doesn't automatically make it one of the best, but that was surely the case for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, an RPG that will easily take you 100+ hours if yo",2025-12-24T17:00:00+00:00,,GameSpot - All Content,https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-xbox-games-of-2025-according-to-metacritic/2900-7359/

Fallout's Latest Episode Snuck In An Incredible Fallout: New Vegas Meme,"Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead. Another week, another episode of Fallout. This week saw lots of use of Lucy’s (Ella Purnell) “Golden Rule” and a look into the politics of the Brotherhood of Steel. In many ways this episode felt like a significant step forward for the series, but it also took its time to honor Fallout’s past.

"Fallout Season 2, Episode 2 Summary: War (And Radscoprions) Never Change","Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead. While last week focused on Lucy (Ella Purnell), Cooper Howard aka The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and their pursuit of Hank (Kyle Maclachlan), this week we caught up with the newly knighted Maximus (Aaron Moten) and his chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline. The episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast.

The Best Games To Play Over The Holiday Break 2025,"As we near the end of the year and the holidays are quickly approaching, people are spending the remainder of their vacation days, kids are out of school, and college students are coming back home to see friends and family. It is also a great time to meet up and reconnect with those faces you may not have seen in a while, or just time to unwind and relax. Either way, games are a great way to spend newfound time off, and luckily, 2025 saw the release of some wonderful titles that can appeal to whatever sort of gaming relaxation you are looking for. Whether you're looking for a game to boot up at a party or something to put on and escape into as a blizzard rages outside, here are 10 games that are great to check out this holiday. Super Mario Party Jamboree Nothing screams holidays quite like getting together again with your friends or family and screaming at them for stealing your stars in a Mario Party game. The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked. Read our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 2) Call of Duty Black Ops 7 When work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes. Read our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake With the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate. Read our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Few games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about. Read our review of Expedition 33 here . Sonic Racing: Crossworlds I've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time. Read our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here Split Fiction If you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass. Read our review of Split Fiction here . Ball X Pit There is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that ""one more run"" itch.

AI VTuber Neuro-Sama Just Obliterated Her Own Massive Twitch World Record,"In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the Vedal987 Twitch channel within a limited time. Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a Minecraft Hardcore run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can ""see"" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model. Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.

"I Hated Parrying, Until I Played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33","Parrying is about subtlety. It's the act of scrutinizing fisticuffs and sword fights with a furrowed brow, familiarizing yourself with the cadence of combat right down to milliseconds, and learning the precise moment of performing a counter attack. For instance, a small variation in animation may point to a rare opening. A slight note change in the audio cue may indicate a shift of attacks from the enemy. To parry well is to understand these details and adapt to them dexterously. That said, doing so is exhausting. The requirements needed to pull off a parry in most games can be steep and exacting. It's why I'd usually avoid parrying if there are other ways to minimize damage during combat, such as blocking or dodging. The painterly Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, one of my favorite RPGs this year, has been the exception. Within its dazzling combat system I've discovered the joy of parrying, every encounter an exhilarating sequence of silky-smooth attacks and ripostes. Fighting in Expedition 33 is a resplendent affair, thanks to its surprisingly in-depth and complex structure. Its skirmishes enhance JRPG-inspired turn-based combat with real-time elements that get players to dodge--and parry--at the right moment.

Best New Games Without AI,"The use of Generative AI (or GenAI for short) is on the rise, with many examples in some of the biggest games of the year using art, voice recordings, and narratives, just to name a few, now coming to light. For many players, a studio’s use of AI as a shortcut, instead of commissioning an artist, hiring a voice actor, or paying a writer to create assets for the final product, is something they actively don’t want to buy. So this curated list that’s human-approved with only a spellchecker to assist in its creation will highlight the best games in 2025 where AI is, as far as we know, not involved in the development process. They all come from a whole bunch of developers, big and small, spanning a wide range of genres. The one thing they have in common is that a dedicated team of people worked on it without any assistance from GenAI tools. It’s important to clarify that any procedural generation of maps, or randomized abilities or enemies, uses AI to determine what appears, and is not the same as GenAI. We’re specifically excluding games that use AI to generate any assets, whether it’s disclosed at the point of sale or found out after publishing. If it’s ethically problematic for any of these reasons, a game won’t be included on the list, no matter how much of a Game of the Year contender it is. With that, here are the best games without AI involvement in their development. Hades 2 Platforms : PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 Developer : Supergiant Games Release date : September 25, 2025 Hades 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Supergiant Games’ Game of the Year, which puts you in the shoes of the immortal Princess Melinoë as she attempts to save her father Hades and his kingdom from the time-looping clutches of the Titan Cronos. It largely follows a similar Roguelike structure, where each run has you collect powers from the Ancient Greek Pantheon to augment your chosen weapon and crush the foes in your way. Of course, with every sequel, you need to outdo what came before. Naturally, this means having two separate paths from the beginning, each with its own layout. One leads to the depths of Hades to Cronos, while the other has Melinoë ascend to the peak of Mt Olympus to defeat the invading monsters. Fans of the first will likely already have this one, but you don’t need to have mastered the original to enjoy everything that Hades 2 has to offer. See on Amazon Dispatch P latforms : PC, PlayStation 5 Developer : AdHoc Studio Release date : October 22, 2025 Released episodically, Dispatch is a wonderful throwback from the team behind The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Throughout its first season, you are a former superhero, Mechaman, who becomes a dispatcher for a new generation of heroes. However, he ends up managing a team of miscreants who are easily sidetracked by a little bit of arson or petty theft. It’s up to you to keep everything on track, even when things go south. Whether it’s allocating the right person for a particular job or making sure another hero doesn’t get sidetracked, each chapter has significant decisions that drastically change the outcome of a mission. By reading each hero's bio and upgrading their skills, you’ll increase your chances of success. You’ll also occasionally need to hack into systems remotely to assist your heroes when they’re in peril. Dispatch’s stunning cast, which includes professional voice actors and some YouTubers branching out and doing a decent job in bringing these larger-than-life characters to life. By the time you reach the end, only one question will likely be on your mind: when’s season 2? See on Steam Absolum Pl atforms : PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 Developer : Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks Release date : October 9, 2025 For fans of retro beat-'em-ups such as Streets of Rage or Final Fight, it’s been quite a while since a brand-new series broke ground. Absolum carefully blends in Roguelike game mechanics to make what Steve Watts, in his review, described as “a match made in heaven”. You play as one of a band of rebel wizards led by Root Mother Uchawi, a benevolent god-like being, who attempts to take on the tyrant Sun King Azra and his Crimson Order army, who have taken over the world of Talamh. With multiple characters to play with their own fighting style, a phenomenal soundtrack, stunning visuals, and a Hades-like elemental progression system for every run, it’s easy to see how this is a winning formula. On top of that, there are plenty of branching paths and hidden secrets to find along the way. Quests ask you to venture to specific points, but don’t always require that you reach them in the same run. Some may feel that the Roguelike structure holds it back because it doesn’t lean into it enough, but it instead asks for the player to master its mechanics by giving them familiar challenges, and as such, may be somewhat fairer to their time. If you’re not convinced",2025-12-23T20:45:00+00:00,,GameSpot - All Content,https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-without-ai/2900-7369/

Sure, the sheer number of games available to play made deciding on one hard, but whether you're sitting down in front of a custom-built gaming rig or you've purchased a handheld PC for some bedtime fun, there's bound to be something that catches your eye. In 2025, PC gamers were spoilt for choice. Several early-access games were released in full, the best of Xbox and PlayStation launched on those platforms, and quirky indies offered unique experiences to savor. Games like Hades 2, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Absolum were a blast of fun, while other releases like Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo, The Roottrees are Dead, and The Seance of Blake Manor are destined to become cult classics in the years to come.

Review – Atelier Ryza Secret Trilogy DX (PlayStation 5),"New Old Beginnings Atelier Ryza is the latest trilogy of games to receive the DX (Deluxe) treatment, by this they have been released with new features aswell as all DLC included in its bundle and the best thing is you can purchase these separately or as a bundle, either way if you have yet to play the Ryza trilogy or have missed finishing it this may be just the best way to do it. The original Atelier Ryza is 6 years old now and with Atelier Ryza 3 Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key releasing in 2023 it was only a matter of time until we got a full bundle of all 3 games, not only this but Atelier Ryza 1 and 2 saw a release on PS4 meaning now you can play the whole trilogy on PS5 with upscaled graphical enhancements. Atelier Ryza follows the story of Ryza as she wishes to embark on a journey outside of her comfort zone or rather the shackles of a routine living with her parents who are eager for her to constantly do chores, it is a coming of age story where she and her friends discover alchemy a new world and ultimately find purpose, it is a bit more mature compared to previous Atelier stories, not Dark in anyway (we’ll leave that to Yumia) but Ryza is a Voluptuous character and the reason why the game has it’s general fan service rooted firmly in the ground. The scale of these games is even bigger than anything we have seen before with much bigger open world maps, a somewhat more bigger emphasis on alchemy with it being a tiny bit more complex and the need to explore, and a lot more cutscenes. Much like previous Atelier games, Ryza is a series of games that does not go into deep and complex narratives, the characters are pretty much finding their feet, they kind of remind me of the characters from the Neptunia series of games where everything is overexaggerated, such as characters being scared of a happy slime enemy early on as if they have never seen a monster before only to go and battle some evil dragon during a side quest later on, having small disagreements with other party members about how hungry they are. Being JRPGs though the trilogy still has other aspects of the game such as combat and the alchemy side of things, once Ryza learns about Alchemy the premise of the game is to learn about new recipe’s that will help aid her in her journey, the recipes can vary from Bombs, healing items and making a new weapon or piece of armour, again if you’ve played an Atelier game before you pretty much know what to expect. Making these items is a big part of the game as they help massively during combat and of course being one step ahead of the enemy is always a good idea in any JRPG. To create these items though Ryza and her friends must scale the big wide world and use her tools in order to collect reagents in order to make the Items needed on the journey, these Items can start off by simply being picked up but Ryza’s tools will see improvement and allow her to gather by smacking huge rocks into smaller ones or cutting a huge bush down with a scythe to gather its contents. What is really great about this system that has carried over with these games and is even a part of Atelier Sophie 2 is the feature gives you reason to explore and even go back to areas to grab items which previously were not gatherable. Combat wise the Atelier Ryza trilogy utilizes a turn based approach while incorporating some real time elements to it. Attacks will build Action Points which can be used to perform skills or special attacks, or to raise the party’s Tactics Level which gives access to more powerful abilities and can really turn the tide of battle. There are some significant changes between the games of the trilogy which were part of the original games and still maintain those and these are of course due to the fact the games had evolved, I already had mentioned how big the maps were of Ryza as a whole but Atelier Ryza 2’s approach was to make the maps massive, it’s essentially a giant interconnected world while Ryza 3 does away with all of that and has four regions to explore which are are separate from each other, The scale of Atelier Ryza 3 is undoubtably huge as there are no loading screens unless you fast travel or go into buildings. In Atelia Ryza 2 Battles progress in real time, and the characters you are not controlling directly will act automatically. Again you can us Action Points to use special keys. Atelier Ryza 3’s battle system introduces keys into its battles which are a core part of the games story hence why it is in the title, these keys will provide buffs to the party during battle. The new features included in the DX Trilogy are as follows: Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness and the Secret Hideout DX comes with two new playable episodes, the first episode which features Kilo and Bos, and allows players to take control of Kilo for the first time, the second episode is a gap that bridges the first Ryza game and the start of Atelier Ryza 2 so you get to see what Ryza was up to between these two games.

Review – Syberia Remastered – PlayStation 5,"Is Syberia Remastered worth the adventure or should it be left out in the cold? Syberia Remastered is a well, a remaster of Syberia, the 2002 adventure game from Benoît Sokal of Inspector Canardo comic fame. The game and the entire franchise is developed and published by French creatives Microids. Many many moons ago, back in my youth I can recall seeing the game upon it’s original release and for a reason now lost to time I was unable to play it. So, when the chance to review Syberia Remastered came up I simply couldn’t turn it down. In the alternative world to our own players take on the role of Kate Walker, a New York based lawyer. Kate is sent across the pond to the fictional (although given it’s an alternative universe it’s all fictional) town of Valadilene. Valadilene is famed for it’s automatons and the factory that produces them, the Voralberg factory named after the family that have ran it for generations. Speaking of exploring, lets discuss the games controls. Guiding Kate Walker around the beautiful clockpunk Art Nouveau world is in a word, frustrating. Kate moves so slowly even when holding down sprint, it almost felt torturous. Being a big fancy pants New York lawyer Kate has a deadline but you’d never no this from the manner in which she crawls around. Not only is Kate slow, you’re also required to be exceptionally precise with her movements to interact with objects in the environment. Many a time would I have Kate pirouette on the spot trying to manoeuvre her into place to start a conversation or collect an object I needed to complete a puzzle. Immediately Syberia Remastered felt different, our protagonist Kate, she’s a rather ordinary person, which makes me extraordinary for gaming protagonists. Kate is in Valadilene to finalise the sale of the Voralberg factory. Upon arriving in Valadilene I was immediately struck by how stunning the town looked, not only it’s art design but the visuals in general. I’ve played many remasters over recent years and while most have technically improved upon the visuals none have done so to the degree achieved by Syberia Remastered. Every single environment you traverse looks incredible, character models do clash a little with the rendered backgrounds but are still a marked improvement from 2002. One of two issues I had with the visuals of the game were that Kate Walker looks strangely unrecognisable, which is an odd to thing say given I never played the original, but the nevertheless Kate doesn’t look like Kate. Overall it’s a small issue and is only noticeable when we come to the second visual issue, the cutscenes. The visual overhaul of Syberia is impressive but this isn’t the case when it comes to games cutscenes, they immediately date the game and remind you that it’s 2002, not to mention that Kate looks different to the woman you’ve been exploring this world as. While we’re on the topic of frustration, Syberia Remastered places many things in Kates path on her quest to find the Voralberg heir, namely a plethora of puzzles. Were they frustrating? No, every single puzzle in Syberia Remastered is perfect, they become steadily more difficult as the game progresses but at no point are they obtuse. The most challenging for me personally was crafting a cocktail for a former opera star, and when I discovered the reason I was stuck I felt like a clockwork idiot (it helps to switch machines on). The former opera star for whom Kate and I were required to mix a cocktail before is just one of many memorable characters you’ll meet during your time with Syberia Remastered. One of the first is Oscar, a clockwork automaton who’s is so wonderfully written he possess more humanity than the majority of gaming characters you’ll ever encounter. In fact, almost everyone feels incredibly real, clockwork or flesh and blood I can’t recall the last time I played a game which inhabitants felt quite so real. As always I avoid spoilers in my reviews and Syberia Remastered will be no different in except one way. Originally Syberia was meant to be one massive game, but it was too big so it was split into two titles (hopefully we’ll get a remaster of part 2) and while you certainly get a full narrative and a resolution to all the plot threads the games main through line certainly has a rather abrupt conclusion. Syberia Remastered has essentially two narrative threads, Kates quest to find Hans Voralberg and that of the personal life she left behind in New York. You’ll experience the latter through Kates mobile phone. People will call to check in with Kate and see how things are going, or just for a little chinwag. These folk range from Kates belligerent boss, her eccentric mother and Dan. Dan and Kate are engaged and to be frank and risk breaking my no spoilers rule, he’s a complete and utter tosser. Every single time Kates phone rang I was pleading for it not to be Dan, or her boss, in fact almost every time the phone rang it was annoying, maybe this is just my millennial distaste for ph",2025-11-25T19:46:51+00:00,Ryan Perrow,GameHype,https://www.gamehype.co.uk/review-syberia-remastered-playstation-5/
Review – Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth Trilogy (PlayStation 5),"The long awaited trilogy from Arfoire The Hyperdimension Neptunia series has been around for sometime now which started on the PS3 has seen releases on various consoles and is a series that makes light fun and parodies of the gaming industry in real life and other forms of Japanese Culture. The series has also branched off into a manga and light novels, with the sheer amount of games released and sold outside of Japan it is clear the games do have a cult following although the games have seemingly stagnated as of late, still you can’t deny it is a series that is still going strong. Previously available on the PS Vita the Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth Trilogy is now available to PS4 and PS5 users. With all three needing separate purchases is it a steal or another cash grab extraction? In Hyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth1+ you play as Neptune who had been defeated in Gamindustri by the other goddesses and banished from the heavens where she fell and lost her memory. In this low stakes adventure Neptune finds a book which has the collective memories of Gamindustri and is joined by companions IF and Compa embarking on a quest to save the world. What makes the Neptunia series unique as a whole is the uniqueness of each character, no two characters ever feel the same and having a series of games where new characters become a part of the world, their unique traits and constant breaking of the 4th wall makes it an engaging JRPG experience if you understand the jokes and references, while it may not be to everyone’s taste if you understand the references it makes the game more engaging and hilarious. The war in Gamindustri is that of a console war quite literally, the Neptunia series took all the mainline consoles and aligned certain characters to said console while of course changing their names somewhat for copyright reasons, obviously. Various other story elements were actually changed in the game altogether due to licencing issues. Each character takes precedence over certain nations within the world. Leanbox for example is a parody of Xbox, each nation consisting of a Basilicom, a holy organisation that serves each CPU’s nation. Once you regain control of Neptune and set of on the long journey with IF and Compa you find yourself soon battling strange foes and exploring the world, noticeable right away if you did play the original version is the massive change no only to the story but to the interface, the interface is much more vibrant now and certain text elements are much easier to read. While I did not mind the original look and feel of the Rebirth, the developers have now developed it keeping it in line with its sequel and third entry. Rebirth 2 introduces a new cast of characters Nepgear Uni Rom and Ram, these characters being the little sisters of the 4 goddesses who return also are aligned to handheld consoles, Nepgear along with the other CPU little sisters job is to free the older sisters who have been captured, a simple premise but works well and is a great idea and introduction to bringing in new characters and having a background to match with other consoles. Re:birth 3 has Neptune reprising her main role and gets sucked into a parallel dimension where everything has an 80s look, where she meets alternative versions of the other CPU’s and has a focus on the CPU wars of that time, while Neptunia tries to find her way home she attempts to stop the seven sages of the world who are against the CPUs controlling Gamindustri as they always have. While the three games have different premise, they all feel very similar in gameplay, there is a map that has dungeons and towns which can be accessed by selecting where you want to go, each map has certain items and these can be changed by collecting plans or by fulfilling certain requirements and crafting, you can make different more powerful enemies spawn on weaker maps and defeating these early on can really give you an advantage however be prepared for the challenge. Completing quests will also offer quick money and Items to help you on your journey. These systems are completely optional but if you are focused on a full completion of the game and wanting certain achievements then this will be something you will need to look into. Certain metrics will also determine how the game ultimately reaches its conclusion, there is a lot to uncover and with the game requiring several playthroughs if you want to experience everything then the Rebirth trilogy is perfect in terms of replay-ability. The gameplay loop of the Re:Birth trilogy is similar but unique as I’ve not come across too many JRPG’s that use its formula in the same way. While you can play each game without straying from the main path too much the game rewards you if you do, you can grind more powerful weapons early on if you wish and because of how the game is designed you can get an advantage early on, one way of doing this is the rings that give you a massive boost to Health, while enemies may take lon",2025-11-22T13:19:09+00:00,Aaron Jones,GameHype,https://www.gamehype.co.uk/review-hyperdimension-neptunia-rebirth-trilogy-playstation-5/
Review – Radiolight (Steam/PC),"If you go down to the woods today… you’re in for a fright Radiolight is a single player first person thriller, developed and published by Kryštof Knesl. Set in the fictional town of Ashwood Creek in 1980’s America, you play as police officer Ethan Collins who is investigating the disappearance of a 14 year old boy in the national park, and the possible disappearance of park ranger Harvey Waters. The game begins at your home. You wander around looking at various items and opening drawers to get used to the controls until you go into your daughter Mia’s room, where she will give you the radio that will become one of your main tools soon enough. After your conversation with Mia you hear the phone ringing downstairs, answering it will send you to the national park on the hunt for Harvey. When you arrive at the visitors centre at the entrance to the park, you notice several things out of place and use your walkie talkie to report to Rob, your colleague. A prompt will appear on screen when you need to report something, usually over the item, but sometimes a speech bubble will appear in the top right of the screen to tell you to get on your walkie talkie. During conversations you will have multiple choices of response, you can only pick one to advance the conversation and there is a limited time to choose. Once you are done looking around the visitors centre, you take the key to the park gate and enter the woods. Radiolight takes place at night and there are no lights in the wood, so you will rely heavily on your flashlight for most of the game, this helps make the world feel much bigger than it is. There is no map or compass to follow, but the game herds you in the right direction with natural barriers and the occasional sign pointing to certain places such as the rangers cabin or an observation point. One area Radiolight excels is in its music, sound effects and its use of quiet environments. At times when wandering the woods, ominous music will start. With the low visibility due to the darkness and concentration of trees, the woods become very creepy, the sound effects make the game feel tense and you expect to jump out of your skin frequently, but the game doesn’t make heavy use of jump scares or gore, so when it does happen make sure you have a helmet on as you will hit the ceiling. I would suggest playing the game with headphones as it really enhances the experience and makes the wood feel alive, it also increases the tension you feel at being alone except for Rob on the other end of the walkie talkie. Speaking of radios, you can walk around with yours on whenever you want and tune it to different stations. There is not much choice of what to listen to but there is a music station which isn’t bad, though I didn’t listen to it much myself as it seemed out of place to me in the setting. At certain points of the game when you tune the radio, the frequency indicator will turn red and a broken voice speaks to you. This voice reminded me of Bumblebee from the Transformers films in the way that it uses male and female voices for different words while speaking, what it says could be taken as a warning or a threat, you will have to find out. The story is very well done, what starts as a regular investigation soon takes a dark turn (no pun intended) towards the supernatural. Radiolight is a slow paced game, but that suits well with the story it tells, and you get as much out of your own observation as you do from what the game gives you. There is little action in the game, and it is unlike anything I have played before, based on your use of your radio to tune to the right signal before shadowy creatures can get to you.

Review – Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted (PS5),"Fresh from the 2010s, Plant vs. Zombies has made its return to the spotlight with Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. Available on PC, PS5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, developers PopCap Games and The Lost Pixels claim that the Replanted version of the game is “bigger, brighter and crazier than before.” Plants vs. Zombies was all the rage when it was released, even I was a victim of the game’s craze. Fourteen years later, here we are testing the remastered version – the circle of life. Let’s see how this tower defense game stands up against time. The graphics for Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted are good, as would be expected of a remaster. The small cyclical animations used for the game are smooth and well done, maintaining the old school style without seeming clunky. There’s not much to say for the graphics otherwise. The style maintains the simplistic and bright visuals of the original, just in high definition. There’s a fun toggle in the settings to give the plants and/or zombies a retro pixelated style. Completely unnecessary, but a bit of wholesome fun. Audio is the same as the original game, with jazzy little jingles and shooting sound effects. It’s minimalistic and aligned with the original but again, nothing noteworthy. Gameplay was fun, and could be addicting for some. For me, this tower defense style is too repetitive and gets old fast. The nostalgia of the game still made the playthrough entertaining. The gameplay style, however, does feel foreign on a controller, as the mechanisms were designed for mobile, but it is manageable and easy still. Perfect for children, or other adults looking for a hit of nostalgia. There are very few differences between the mobile version of Plants vs. Zombies and Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. This is because, as much as they might advertise “bigger” and “better”, it is still just a remaster. The new version includes cut content which, while not featured on the mobile game, was still accessible through other methods. Multiplayer modes have been ported from early console versions of the game, allowing vs and co-op play too. There are also two additional game modes. Cloudy Days reduces the amount of sunshine/points received and R.I.P mode is a perma-death mode where failing a level resets the player to the beginning, adding difficulty tiers to the game. For those who get addicted to tower defense style games, I can imagine the rage inducing pain of losing R.I.P mode. Overall, Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted was a fun way to pass some time, but nothing special. For those who had a true connection with the original game or love nostalgic games, its worth the time but £17.99 is a steep cost for what was essentially a free mobile game. I won’t judge you if you want to spend the money on an innocent bit of fun, as it it faithful to the original mobile game. However, for myself personally I don’t see it being a game I would return to except out of extreme boredom. The game code for this review was provided by EA .

Review – Persona 3 Reload (Switch 2),"I Am Thou, Thou Art Entertained Persona is a series that has always fascinated me. A spin off of the Shin Megami Tensei series than has debatably superseded its origins. Persona is an RPG that borrows many of its systems and monsters from it’s parent series. While having dark moments the tone of Persona is typically a little lighter. With a real focus on the day to day lives of the characters you control. Staying true to turn based game play unlike modern RPG’s, that are increasingly taking an action based route.Persona 3 Reload is a remake that sets out to modernise while retaining its original vision. Initially launched last year on consoles to the praise of critics and players, we will be looking at the upcoming port release for the Switch 2. The narrative follows the protagonist (named by the player) returning to their home city. Upon returning not everything is as it seems. A green light reflected from a moon of equal hue. Motionless upright coffins with a concerning lack of population. Pools and splatters of blood across a lifeless city. This is discovered to be what is known as the dark hour, a 25th hour of the day after midnight that only certain individuals seemingly experience. The protagonist joins S.E.E.S a group who all experience the dark hour and are actively uncovering its mystery.The story is largely unaltered from the original game. Ultimately no changes needed to be made. For the most part it is very well paced, treating you to enough mystery to keep you engaged. The core gameplay loop is split into two very distinct halves, the RPG dungeon crawling and the day to day life simulation. The dungeon crawling largely takes place in Tartarus, a massive ever changing tower that appears each dark hour over the protagonist’s school. Every time you choose to explore it the floor plan will be randomly generated. Offering different layouts, shadows to fight, treasures and most importantly stairs to progress your journey. With 264 floors to conquer you will be spending a lot of time in the eerie halls of Tartarus. In your time climbing Tartarus you will fight a lot of shadows. Persona 3’s turn based combat is truly a joy and a real stand out in the genre. The combat system has been very similar for decades but if its not broke don’t fix it. Each character has an attack and the ability to summon a persona (creatures that cast spells and abilities). If you inflict damage a shadow is weak to they will be stunned and you will get another attacking turn. The system encourages experimentation with each new shadow you fight to try and gain the upper hand. If the player manages to stun all shadows in a battle you can launch an all out attack. This is where your whole team attacks the whole shadow team dealing a high damage output. Although not the most complex battle system in the genre its an incredibly enjoyable one which has aged like a fine wine. Speaking of persona’s during your time in Tartarus you will find more that join your team. The protagonist has the unique ability that he can hot swap his persona’s and abilities in battle. So collecting multiple persona’s to exploit enemies weaknesses in battle is a must. You also have the ability to fuse two persona’s into a stronger one. A very interesting mechanic that keeps you changing and improving your abilities as the game goes on. It nothing new to this series but still to this date is a fresh twist on creature collecting. The other half of the gameplay loop is the life simulation. Persona 3 runs on a day by day calendar system where the player chooses how the protagonist spends their time. After attending school you have two time slots to fill with whatever you desire. After school and evening often have different activities that can progress the story, the protagonist skills or social connections with other characters. Having explorable environments to find activities to fill the protagonists time. All activities or socialising have the chance to improve both the protagonists stats or social links that boost persona’s in battle. Virtually all of them play out in a visual novel style that can be very wordy. Not all of which impact or further the main plot. While I can see that some gamers could get frustrated with the sheer amount of these, I would argue they are well worth your time. Many of the social scenes add so much character and charm to the experience it would be a shame to skip them. The writing is often so great you can’t help but care for these characters which in any other game would be glorified stat trainers. Graphically the game has had an extensive overhaul. Taking clear inspiration from the insanely popular and stylish Persona 5. Highly detailed 3D anime models for the characters. Environments oozing with small details and polish, especially if you can read a bit of Japanese. Not only does it graphically borrow from Persona 5 but also in its user interface as well. Menu’s are beautifully animated with changing 2D anime visuals, adding",2025-11-09T20:26:43+00:00,Andy Kelsall,GameHype,https://www.gamehype.co.uk/review-persona-3-reload-switch-2/
Arcade Returns in Miniature with the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player,"PAC-MAN has hit the shelves once again, marking another resurgence of the iconic yellow glutton. First making an appearance in 1980, PAC-MAN continues to be a celebrity on the gaming scene. My Arcade has collaborated with Bandai to create a miniaturised version of the classic arcade game. The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is a portable retro arcade machine fitted with a 3.5″ screen and built-in speakers. This machine boasts two game modes and two-player play in one small package. Retro gaming has lasted the test of time and remained popular amongst gamers and hipsters alike, making this a potential hit for collectors. For this review, I combined forces with mum, a 70s baby who lived through the PAC-MAN hype first hand. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● First Impressions First impressions of the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player is the packaging. The packaging is simple and maintains the theme with a simple border design shaped like the machine inside. The classic PAC-MAN logo is featured and small enough that the Joystick Player remains the main focal point. Each package contains a My Arcade Certificate of Authenticity, confirming the product is officially licensed by Bandai. This is a cool little addition, making the Joystick Player seem more valuable. Realistically, there is no serial number attached to the certificate so one could be easily faked to up value knock-offs. Still, the concept is quite fun. Build and Durability The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is incredibly light yet still sturdy. It withstood a good shake and a few (accidental) tumbles. There’s a plastic cover protecting the screen that’s printed with the PAC-MAN game scene. The game interface is simple – a screen, four buttons, and the joystick. The joystick itself has the familiar clunkiness of a life-size retro arcade machine. It’s sturdy in its socket and feels durable, rather than the cheap tacky plastic most mini machines used. The same can be said of the overall machine. It feels sturdy and well-constructed, like an actual console instead of a mini-machine Nothing but the best for PAC-MAN I suppose. The battery compartment is on the rear of the machine. This PAC-MAN machine takes four AA-battery. I was briefly surprised and annoyed by this, as I expect most electronics to be rechargeable. I then looked down and saw the USB-C port, so this electronic is indeed rechargeable using a wire most people have in possession. Audio comes from the small speaker just above the battery component. The volume is adjusted using the plus and minus shaped buttons on either side of the power switch. An audio jack is available for sound output. The power switch requires a firm push and makes an audible click, giving it that clunky retro feel. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Performance There isn’t much I can say for performance – it’s PAC-MAN, just miniature. Fans of the original, or of similar retro games, will no doubt enjoy this PAC-MAN Joystick Player. It’s true to original with the gameplay and graphics. The only difference is the pixels are much, much clearer. Players start the game by adding ‘credits’ to the machine before selecting play-mode. I struggled with directing my little PAC-MAN with the joystick, but this was simply a skill issue. Handing the game to my mum, she smashed it. Two-player mode isn’t simultaneous play. With the size of the machine, simultaneous play would be near impossible. Instead, the second player begins when the first player dies and vice versa until all lives are used up. This adds pressure to keep the game out of your friends hands and claim the highest score. Speed Up mode is the same game with added anxiety. Everything remains the same but PAC-MAN picks up speed, flying across the map. Both modes are fun, but if I continued to play on speed-up mode the Joystick Player would also be flying… out the window. Audio comes from one small speaker, giving it a tinny sound reminiscent of retro arcades. This is a nice hit of nostalgia and, similar to real arcades, only fuels the game-induced rage. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Summary Overall, the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player was a great gadget for nostalgic fun. Its portable size makes it easy to take to parties and gathering for easy entertainment. I also found it to be a great shared experience between myself and my mum, and a way to introduce new generations to the classics. The certificate of authenticity gives it a sense of legitimacy that makes it feel more valuable than just a toy. More importantly, the Joystick Player is sturdy and durable, making it fit for travel or being manhandled by a toddler. I can’t speak for how it performs over time, but so far I’m more than happy with the product.

Review – Shuten Order (PC),"A Visual Novel Masquerading as an Adventure Game Released September 5th, 2025, Shuten Order (Shuten Kyodan) claims to the be the “ultimate adventure game” on its website. Shuten Order is the collaborative work of Too Kyo Games and DMM Games, with development by Neilo and published by Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd . This collaborative piece had a positive reception, but with time reviews became more mixed. Shuten Order is an outlandish game with bold characters and themes. These complex themes combined with the self-proclaimed five-in-one adventure means expectations for Shuten Order are astronomical. To make this review as impartial as possible, I entered the game with no prior research. The only knowledge of the plot I had was the description given by Steam. Let’s see if Shuten Order can convert us to their ways. Will we pray for the end of the world, or just the end of this game? Shuten Order is a unique story of religious devotion, hereticism, and betrayal. The game begins with a shocking opening scene, as dismembered remains fall from the sky onto a dystopian city. We watch from a distorted perspective as limbs rain down to earth, a single witness looking on with delighted confusion. Thus the prologue begins. We wake as protagonist Rei Shimobe, in a strange hotel room with no memories. With the assistance of two self-proclaimed angels, Rei discovers that they were the Founder of the religious cult – Shuten Order. The same Founder whose fragmented body parts were scattered across the Central Park in the introduction. Revived by divine power, Rei’s current body is only temporary. To complete her resurrection she must complete God’s Trial and solve the her own murder. She has only four days before her temporary body dissolves and she experiences a true death. The suspects? The Ministers of the Shuten Order – the five people with the access, knowledge, and skill to commit the murder. The consequences? In 168 days, the world will end unless she can crack the case. The narrative of Shuten Order is one of the most unique storylines I’ve ever played. It explores themes of theology and fate, as well as agency in organised religion. Despite the complex undertones of morality and misguided virtues, the high-level plot is still riveting and packed with action and humour. A minimum of thirty two hours commitment is required to complete the game (according to How long is Shuten Order? | HowLongToBeat ). I, however, an employed so this was spread out over multiple weeks. For a visual novel game this can get tedious, so patience is required to progress the story. As a player who absolutely loved the narrative and was invested in the outcome, even I had moments of frustration with some scenes. Visual design of the game is stunning. The illustrations are bold and impactful, fully conveying the stakes and emotion of each scene. Characters designs are unique and memorable, their appearances starkly reflecting their personalities. The bright and cheerful colouring is a complete contrast to the story’s themes. This creates a dystopian feeling of forced normalcy in an oppressive society. Colours are also used for easy distinction of dialogue. Our character’s internal thoughts are written in blue, all spoken dialogue in black, and words spoken with emphasis in orange. Following the prologue, the game branches into five paths – one for each potential suspect. Each suspect comes with a different game system and varying game mechanics. Choosing Inumgi Kishiru, for example, entails a point-and-click detective story where you piece together clues to solve a series of murders. Other game systems include escape rooms and multi-perspective horror. Regardless of the game mechanic, Shuten Order continuously surprised me with the plot twists in each storyline. The absurdity of some situations also made for great entertainment – I would never expect to be held hostage by a VTuber, forced to choose between my moral beliefs and survival. The multiple game systems ensure there will be a style suited to each player. All five paths must be played to complete the story. At a glance, there is no overlap in these stories, however they all align to the overarching plot. ‘Keywords’ are earned by completing specific scenes and objectives, giving important information for deducing the truth of Rei’s death. Keywords are saved and accessible from the menu, which is great because I have terrible memory. Strangely though, the menu is accessed using the tab button, and not escape. I managed to forget this every time I entered the game, leading to much confusion. Actual performance of the game was good. It ran smoothly and I had no problems with the game freezing or crashing. The soundtrack looped almost seamlessly, leaving no awkward silences other than those intended. Controls were straightforward and simple, as expected of a visual novel. Certain actions required not-so quick-time events, which were frustratingly slow. This could arguably be an accessibility",2025-10-29T18:10:23+00:00,Aaliyah Bennett,GameHype,https://www.gamehype.co.uk/review-shuten-order-pc/
Review – Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Review (PlayStation 5),"A Tactical Recall Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation tactical JRPG based on the Final Fantasy series with some new graphical tweaks among other things and even the option to play the game how it was with still original graphics if that is something you wanted to do. The original game was met with high praise due to its story, strategic gameplay which was new at the time to the Final Fantasy series and many praised it alongside it being a Final Fantasy game, living in the UK meant that the game was alienated to me and at the time Final Fantasy VII was all I knew, we have had the psp port of war of the lions and the Game Boy Advance and a DS game also but these again were a new concept for someone such as myself, Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles however has been lovingly recreated with developers old and new and with some of the creative minds from Creative Studio III working on it you can be sure the team behind Final Fantasy XIV and XVI had some input and it shows and now I can finally play it. The game follows Ramza who is the third son of House Beoulve who finds himself during a conflict where two opposing factions are competing for the throne of the Kingdom of Ivalice, the game remains pretty faithful to the original but not to be confused with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. To begin with there are two game modes, the first allows you to play Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles which is the new updated game with new UI, scripts and voice acting added to the game and trophy support, or you can opt for the game how it was originally which while it does have some QOL features its purpose only serves to tell the story as it was originally, in this mode trophies too also are completely disabled. Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles can does have an overbearing amount of things to dig into although much of this can be likely ignored, firstly there is an encyclopedia which is used as a reference to locations and characters of the world but bigger than that is a feature known as State of the Realm and is something we saw also in Final Fantasy XVI which includes references and details about this story and as it ever evolves it shows key moments to where characters have moved within the narrative. Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles takes place on an overworld map of Ivalice, of course that consists of points and moving to points can initiate a battle or it will be a town where you can re-outfit your companions and also serve as hubs for story progression and side quests. By moving onto a field where enemies exist a battle can take place if you choose to initiate, it is never known what you might come up against as I have entered battles and come away severely on the brink of death and then sometimes I have managed to best all enemies on the field. Although you may be able to dispatch a few enemies it is worth noting the difficulty of Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles remains consistent for a few reasons. For the most part your roster of characters while can be big you are restricted to the amount of characters you can send out on a map once battles take place, while you may only be able to send 5 to 6 units out you may be up against an army of 10 or 11 enemies at a time; also counter in the fact one of your player characters can be permanently removed from the game should they fall in battle and then lose several turns after if they are not revived, then tactics for sure are required to best your enemy. Even if a few enemies are only present at a time on the map, some can be incredibly strong, such as the wild chocobos early on and if you find yourself in a bad spot a chocobo can easily knock a character out in no time at all. While a character may be able to hold out on their own it is very easy to get overwhelmed and the game makes you focus on sticking together. This is mitigated by the fact that battles can be escaped from. With that being said tactics remains an important factor in order to get through the game. Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles features a robust job system where you can align jobs to your characters in order to use their respective spells and abilities. Using attack and spells on enemies allows you to gain EXP and JP, the latter JP refers to Job Points which are used to learn certain new abilities related to your job, spells can be exceptionally strong and can even interact with the environment, enemy stats and turn orders can be seen as well as the damage is expected to be inflicted so while QOL features are here the game is still on the more difficult side. The job system requires certain pre-requisites before later jobs are unlocked such as getting existing jobs to a certain level, there is a grind associated that can be alleviated by using the fast forward feature during battles, once you do it unlocks some broken combinations, maybe not to the level that a game such",2025-10-19T18:22:46+00:00,Aaron Jones,GameHype,https://www.gamehype.co.uk/review-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review-playstation-5/
FC 26 Xbox Series X Review,"FC 26 excels on the pitch; it’s a near league-winning, title-charging blast. This year, EA Sports made a point of going above and beyond in delivering a unique football experience, distinct from previous entries in the FC/FIFA franchise. Taking on board player feedback, media criticisms, and in-house suggestions, this has led to an unprecedented overhaul of the football sim. With some features being positive and others less so. So, did EA Sports deliver? Or have they talked the talk?? (In my opinion, they’ve delivered). The good stuff is an unrivalled element of authenticity. Licenses, player likeness, kits, sponsors, and commentary teams offer players a very generous amount of real-life likeness unseen in other football sims. As your favourite players exit the tunnels and enter the pitch to the roars of the crowd, the production values are of an incredibly high standard, with stadiums, club anthems, and pre-match visuals providing a genuinely jaw-dropping, realistic experience. If I were to see an FC26 pre-match presentation up the pub on a screen, I’d believe it was a live broadcast game, such is the true-to-life replication. Ultimately, this is where FC 26 excels. FC 26 offers players two ways of enjoying the beautiful game, with one being “authentic” and the other offering a “competitive” gameplay experience. (Authentic is accessible in offline play only). This brand new approach to FC 26 has been EA Sports’ big reveal this year, and they have strived to offer a realistic football sim experience. (Think back to the old PES days, and you’ll have a rough idea of what route EA Sports is going for here). Slow paced, deft touches, with tactical tweaks impacting how the game plays out. As for online, playing Ultimate Team, I felt that In-game defending feels more enhanced than last year. AI (at last) appears improved with significantly better responsiveness. On a personal note, I’m more of a showpony. I love dancing through teams using the 5* skills and trickster playstyle. I’m pleased to say the dribbling system remains effective and very satisfying; it’s a fun alternative approach to try and break through defences. Exploits like the cutbacks and power headers are much less effective. My one criticism of gameplay would be that the long ball option doesn’t come off anywhere near as frequently as it should. Grounded passes with build-up play, holding possession with quick one/two touches, seem considerably more productive. I found this a little frustrating, as game plans can change, particularly if looking for a quick counter, hoof it up the pitch tactic to claw a goal back. Yet, it seems rather pointless as 95% of the time, I found the opposition’s defender would always get to the ball before the attacker. Sadly, it’s some of the smaller, fine margins that hurt the product, such as the pay-to-win model in Ultimate Team and a very ugly user interface. I don’t blame EA Sports for monetising the mode; it brings in huge revenue, so it’s understandable. At the same time, when you’ve got folk forking out £60+ on the game, you’ll always get some saying they shouldn’t have to spend more money (opening packs to acquire a great team) to get the best experience out of the game. In trying to freshen the Ultimate team mode, EA has gone back to the past for inspiration. The return of exclusive silver tournaments, events, and even silver icons offers an interesting spin on a mode riddled with some overpowered gold meta cards that can give a bad player a clear advantage over someone less fortunate to own such a team. Unfortunately, menus are all over the place; it feels like a grind just to find the latest campaign objectives and live events. There’s way too much junk all crammed into the mode (some of it needlessly) in attempts to keep it fresh and players engaged. Another negative to Ultimate Team is the game hacks from the PC network of gamers. For this reason, I’d recommend players have crossplay OFF until patched. Online draft & the live events, such as the gauntlet challenge, are riddled with PC gamers hacking into the server and freezing opponents’ teams to claim an easy win. If there’s a way EA Sports can offer an “Authentic mode” option for Ultimate Team next year, then it would be most welcome. As Ultimate Team is by some margin the mode with the most depth and live updates for those of us looking to dip in regularly throughout the year. Lastly, I’d also like to add that Ultimate Team does NOT have the two gameplay options. This mode is competitive play only. Competitive in UT feels different from last year; gameplay is considerably smoother, animations look improved (gone are the robotic, flat-out weird running animations from previous years), and the game handles more fluidly and cleanly. Visually, it looks as eye-pleasing as it always has. Player models are sharp, showcasing some impressive 4k graphical details with some lifelike facial expressions, strands of hair (such as Cucurella’s mop of locks) sway everywh",2025-10-01T15:36:09+00:00,John Betts,GameHype,https://www.gamehype.co.uk/fc-26-xbox-series-x-review/

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is Hideo Kojima’s “Masterpiece” Because it’s His Latest Game,"In a new video courtesy of Wired, Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima has referred to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach as his “masterpiece”. In the video, where he answers questions asked by fans of his works, Kojima clarified that he always looks at the most recent project he worked on as his best one so far. When asked “what do you consider your masterpiece,” Kojima responded by saying that he gets asked this question a lot, and “my latest work is my masterpiece. So that would be Death Stranding 2.” Throughout the video, he also went into more detail about various aspects of game development, including how he sees the interactivity offered by video games as a medium being its most important and interesting aspect. For instance, he is asked what makes a game “good” for him. To this he responds by noting that, along with the love of its creator, a game is often good based on how well it uses its interactivity. “First, the creator’s love,” said Kojima. “That’s key. Also, since it is interactive, say there’s an item with one intended use. But it doesn’t end there. The player thinks ‘Maybe I can use it this way too?’ and tries it out. It works, and they think, ‘Oh, cool!’ Then they try another way, and realize that’s prepared too. It’s about that level of freedom. The player discovers things for themselves, and finds those mechanics.” This answer is in turn summarized as: “You have to feel the creator’s love. A great game offers a high level of freedom, allowing players to discover their own unique ways to utilize items.” Another question asked by a hobbyist game developer revolves around how the developer can make a game that “never gets old, one you want to replay after completing it,” to which Kojima responds by noting that the important aspects of a game aren’t just their stories, but also their worlds, controls, and immersion. “You want to be there,” he explained. “It’s about making you want to stay and play. Say you stop playing for the night. You go to school or work. The key is wanting to return to that world. Making the player want to dive back in is crucial for games. There’s a unique world inside that space, where you can be different from your ordinary self. It lets you do things you can’t do in real life. That’s vital.” In the same Q&A video, Kojima had also spoken about what kinds of projects he would like to work on in the future . When asked about new genres he wanted to take on, Kojima responded by saying that “I want to pioneer a new genre, so I don’t focus much on existing ones.” This project, according to Kojima, would be based on “maybe hard sci-fi,” because “I love space settings, so I’d like to try that. I’m also a fan of Westerns, so maybe that. Or a period piece, but those exist already.” After having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach earlier this year, Kojima’s studio—Kojima Productions—is currently working on two projects: horror title OD and espionage game Physint . In the meantime, check out our review of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach , which is currently only available on PS5.",2025-12-24T12:55:40+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-hideo-kojimas-masterpiece-because-its-his-latest-game
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Director Explains How Studio Experimented With AI But Didn’t Like It,"In light of recent controversies surrounding Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 having gotten its Indie Game Awards wins revoked due to its undisclosed use of generative AI, director Guillaume Brioche has now confirmed just how developer Sandfall Interactive had experimented with using the technology when the RPG was being made. In a Q&A session with YouTuber Sushi (which you can check out below), Broche spoke about how everything we can see in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is human-made. However, generative AI coming out in 2022 led to the studio experimenting with the technology as a potential tool. “Yeah, we’re aware of what’s been going on with [ Divinity director Swen Vincke’s statements about AI use ],” explained Broche in response to a question about the studio’s use of generative AI and how it will be used in the future. “But I can say, everything in the game is human made. When AI first really came out in 2022, we’d already started on the game. It was just a new tool, we tried it, and we didn’t like it at all. It felt wrong. We had originally used it as a placeholder for textures we missed, but we took it out as soon as we found it.” “But yeah, the concept art, voice actors, everything is human made. It’s pretty hard what the future [of the industry] will look like, but everything will be made by humans from us.” Broche was referring to Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke’s statements about the use of generative AI at the studio from earlier this month. His statements about how generative AI was being used to “explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text,” drew quite a bit of controversy among fans of Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 , who noted that using it in concept art would taint the rest of the art that was built on top for the game. This criticism had prompted Vincke to issue another statement later where he spoke about how the tools were working as “additive” to the talents of the creative teams rather than generative AI serving as replacements to artists themselves. “We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse,” said Vincke. The use of generative AI in the gaming industry has been a hot-button issue for a while, but discussions have largely picked up over the previous month, with Warhorse Studios’ Daniel Vávra writing his own lengthy statement about how the world should stop resisting the rise and proliferation of generative AI. In his statement, he noted that “AI is here to stay with us.” “As frightening as it may be, that’s the way it is,” he continued. “Personally, it scares me the most in the music because you can’t even recognise AI there anymore.” Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima also spoke about AI, and how we can’t go back to a world without it, comparing the technology to smartphones .",2025-12-24T12:25:21+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-explains-how-studio-experimented-with-ai-but-didnt-like-it
"Squadron 42 is Now Fully Playable, Will be Over 40 Hours in Length","With 2025 coming to an end, Star Citizen and Squadron 42 developer Cloud Imperium Games has provided an update on the development of both titles through a new Letter From the Chairman post by creator Chris Roberts. In his post, Roberts reflected on the number of updates that were made to the alpha builds of Star Citizen throughout the year, while also confirming that all chapters of Squadron 42 are now playable. Roberts also noted that Squadron 42 measures in at over 40 hours in length, and that the developers are now working on “remaining polish, optimization, and bug fixing.” He also wrote about how Cloud Imperium Games had worked throughout 2025 to build on the development progress it had made on Squadron 42 back in 2024, with a focus on “bringing the game to content complete and closing out remaining core tasks in preparation for Beta.” “A big part of what makes this possible is the technology we’ve built at CIG over many years,” wrote Roberts. “The ability to move seamlessly from on foot, into a vehicle you can fly and move around inside, down to a planet or across star systems, all without loading screens, creates a level of immersion that’s very difficult to replicate. That combination of close-up interaction and galactic scale is at the core of what will make Squadron 42 so unique.” “Equally important is the quality of the content itself. From writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design, the level of care across the entire game is something I’m incredibly proud of. Combined with deeply interactive systems, it creates an experience that pulls you into the world and keeps you there.” As for Star Citizen , Roberts also wrote about a recently-released experimental update released for the game’s Alpha 4.5 build which brings in support for VR headsets. He noted that this “Christmas Surprise” originally started as a passion project and started getting the attention of developers as well as fans of Star Citizen . As part of this VR mode, “almost everything” has been physicalized, which means that it can be interacted with by players with their own hands regardless of whether they are playing in first or third-person views. The VR mode, he noted, also helps further justify the work that Cloud Imperium Games has put into detailing its various environments, props, ships and gear, since players can now experience these things at true scale. The VR mode is still considered “an early and experimental step,” however, and the developers are still working on more ways to improve it. Looking to the future, the studio plans on bringing in a number of improvements to the technology it has already introduced to Star Citizen and Squadron 42 . Among these making Server Meshing—first introduced to Star Citizen through an update earlier this year , allowing the server meshes to automatically reconfigure themselves in real-time based on player activity and server load. There will also be more in-game content introduced over the next year to Star Citizen ’s alpha. Squadron 42 , on the other hand, is currently moving towards its Beta release. However, Cloud Imperium Games hasn’t confirmed when this Beta release is slated to happen.",2025-12-24T11:33:37+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/squadron-42-is-now-fully-playable-will-be-40-hours-in-length
The Witcher 3 to Get New DLC in May 2026 as Lead Up to The Witcher 4’s 2027 Release – Analyst,"While CD Projekt RED has been working on The Witcher 4 , and Fool’s Theory is working on a remake of the original The Witcher , analysts believe that the two studios are also working together for a brand new DLC for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt . According to Polish publication Strefa Inwestorów , Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski is predicting a major new DLC that would bridge the gap between the story of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and The Witcher 4 will be coming out in May 2026. Chrzanowski’s predictions indicate that the DLC will be priced at $30, and that it will come to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt —which originally came out on PC, PS4 and Xbox One all the way back on May 18, 2015. This DLC is also expected to properly kick off the marketing push for The Witcher 4 , which is expected to come out in late 2027. It is worth noting that the two major DLCs released for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine —have already wrapped up the majority of the story arc for protagonist Geralt of Rivia. With that in mind, as well as the fact that The Witcher 4 will feature a brand new protagonist in the form of Geralt’s adopted daughter Ciri, this rumoured DLC will likely give us a deeper glimpse at her story, including the kind of training she goes through to become the hardened witcher we saw in the reveal trailer for The Witcher 4 . Fool’s Theory is rumoured to be taking lead on the development of this DLC, since the studio also has several developers that have previously worked on games in The Witcher franchise in the past. CD Projekt RED itself is yet to make any announcement or offer any confirmation about this DLC, however. As for the remake of the original The Witcher , CD Projekt RED has confirmed that it is slated for release some time after the release of Polaris —the studio’s internal codename for The Witcher 4 . In an earnings call, president and joint CEO of CD Projekt Group Adam Kiciński spoke about how the remake will make use of Unreal Engine 5-based technology that was also used in The Witcher 4 . “Coming back to The Witcher Remake and when it will come,” said Kiciński. “Yes, it will come after Polaris , which is a consequence of how we think about this project. I think The Witcher Remake will be based in big part on technologies from Polaris , so it will be developed partially in parallel to Polaris . But once Polaris is launched, everything for Polaris will be then in the final shape, and it will be partially reused in the remake.” Fool’s Theory CEO Jakub Rokosz has also spoken about the studio’s work on The Witcher remake back in January 2024, where he noted that the studio will be taking out parts of the original title that are considered bad, outdated or “unnecessarily convoluted” by modern gaming standards .",2025-12-24T11:08:42+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/the-witcher-3-to-get-new-dlc-in-may-2026-as-lead-up-to-the-witcher-4s-release-in-2027-analyst
"007 First Light Delayed to May 27th, 2026","Grand Theft Auto 6 has some company in the delay department as IO Interactive has announced it’s pushing back the release of 007 First Light . Don’t worry, though – the action-adventure title will now be releasing two months later on May 27th, 2026. In a Bluesky post, studio CEO Hakan Abrak revealed that the project is “fully playable from beginning to end,” and that the additional time “will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch.” As the company’s “most ambitious project to date” with far more systems than its Hitman franchise , Abrak also feels that the decision “allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.” Of course, there will be more updates on the title early next year, so stay tuned for that. Besides, with Crimson Desert, Replaced, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection and more launching in the same month, shifting to a less busy month could pan out better. Unless other big games are announced for the same time, that is. 007 First Light is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Check out the latest trailer , which showcases Lenny Kravitz as Bawma, one of the antagonists.

Ubisoft Working With Nintendo to Improve VRR Support in More Games,"While it’s no secret that Ubisoft has maintained a close relationship with Nintendo over the years, going as far as making exclusive games for the latter’s consoles, in a new interview, the company has revealed that it is helping Nintendo with improving support for variable refresh rate (VRR) across other games on the Switch 2. While Ubisoft had already spoken about how it achieved VRR support in the Switch 2 version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows , the studio went into more detail with FRVR about the techniques used, including a dedicated algorithm. Ubisoft noted that “both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws use a similar technique to take advantage of Switch 2’s Variable Refresh Rate, even below 40Hz”. “Since Shadows targets 30fps, and the console’s VRR currently only works at 40Hz or higher, we use a clever workaround,” explained the company. “The same frame is effectively presented twice, once in the middle of the frame and again at the end, so the hardware outputs at a 60Hz interval while maintaining smooth visuals”. Ubisoft went on to confirm that this same technology that allows its titles to support VRR on the Switch 2 is now part of the company’s in-house Anvil Engine, which powers all of the company’s modern games. This means that it can also be used for future titles, including the rumoured upcoming Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag Resynced , which will likely also make its way to the Switch 2. Along with this, Ubisoft is “continuing to work with Nintendo to improve VRR support going forward.” While Ubisoft has already released both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws on the Nintendo Switch 2 , it is currently unknown whether the company will bring its other major title— Rainbow Six Siege X —to the platform. Speaking about this, creative director Alexander Karpazis had noted back in October that it wasn’t currently focusing on bringing the competitive shooter to more platforms. However, he also said that it doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t come to Nintendo’s console, using the adage “never say never” . “For us, the focus will always be on the platforms we’re on right now, making sure that it’s the best experience, and when we do new gameplay [that] it makes use of the platforms that we’re on. So right now, any new platform isn’t necessarily a focus for us. But again, we’re a live game, it’s 10 years. I learnt a long time ago to never say never, so we’ll see as platforms grow and new opportunities come up too,” he said in an interview. As for Assassin’s Creed Shadows , Ubisoft revealed in its recent earnings report last month that the open-world action adventure title has been overperforming . In its earnings report, the company noted that the title benefitted from post-launch updates, including the free update that brought in New Game+, as well as the release of the Claws of Awaji expansion.

Speaking to Esports Insider (via Dexerto ), York noted that the currently-planned November 19, 2026 release date for Grand Theft Auto 6 is a good time for the game to come out thanks to it being just a month before Christmas, which tends to be a popular time for shopping. “I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas,” said York. “Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time.” As for the reasons behind the delay— Grand Theft Auto 6 was originally planned for release in May 20260—York believes that the studio has been hard at work to ensure that the game is as good as it possibly can be. This includes the need for polish as well, since the studio also has quite a bit on the line in terms of its reputation and potential revenue. “If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be,” he said. “They’re polishing stuff. I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.” At this point, York also doesn’t think there will be any more delays for the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 . According to him, this largely comes down to the current hype behind the game. However, constant delays will likely end up with people having stopped caring about the game. “If Rockstar Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6 ,” said York. “Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.” “People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it,” he continued. “They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’” While there has undoubtedly been plenty of hype behind Grand Theft Auto 6 , developer Rockstar Games has also recently come under fire for having fired more than 30 of its employees for what it called “gross misconduct.” The employees themselves, along with the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) have been protesting the company, calling its acts union busting .",2025-12-23T12:37:02+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-not-see-another-delay-at-risk-of-losing-hype-says-former-animator
Doom Co-Creator’s New Game Will be Great For Fans of Classic id Software Shooters – Rumour,"While Romero Games’ at-risk shooter has seemingly been rescued from being scrapped, few details have been officially revealed about the title so far. A new report, courtesy of Insider Gaming, however, reveals quite a bit of information, including the fact that it was originally going to be titled Hellslayer , and would have several inspirations from games like Hotline Miami in terms of its mechanics. In a new episode of the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast, Mike Straw has revealed that the title would involve players taking on the role of a priest that is fighting demons. “The new game is not what was [being made] in a partnership with Microsoft,” said Straw. “That game is gone, but they’re taking elements from it.” He went on to discuss the fact that the original version of the game was titled Hellslayer . “It was a first-person shooter inspired by Hotline Miami , meaning that if you die and would just come to life right away,” he continued. While Straw wasn’t able to reveal what elements of this older title were being carried over into the new game, he expressed quite a bit of enthusiasm about what he has learned, especially for players that are already fans of classic id Software titles like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D . As for why only parts of the original iteration of the game are being brought over into the new title, Straw speculated that it likely came down to the developers taking the time to see what they had and making a decision to narrow down the scope of the game. Doom co-creator John Romero himself had confirmed that this shooter project had been saved after having gone through some major changes. In a discussion at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid earlier this month, Romero said that the title had “been basically completely redesigned,” while also noting that it “incorporates a lot of the elements” from the original incarnation of the game. “We’re not starting at ground zero,” explained Romero. “We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.” As part of this redesign, Romero has also confirmed that the scope had been changed, making the newer incarnation of the title a “much smaller game” than what it used to be. This, he noted, also had the added benefit of revitalising the development team. He said, “the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn’t actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that”. “[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that’s why small teams are great,” he continued. Romero had confirmed that this project had been saved a few months after Romero Games CEO Brenda Romero had announced its cancellation from investors having pulled out . At the time, development on the game was noted as going quite well, with the studio being able to hit all required milestones.",2025-12-23T12:00:00+00:00,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/doom-co-creators-new-game-will-be-great-for-fans-of-classic-id-software-shooters-rumour
EA’s Board Approves $55 Billion Acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s PIF and Other Investors,"The planned acquisition of EA by a consortium of investors made up of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Affinity Partners and Silver Lake Partners has now been approved by EA’s shareholders. As caught by Stephen Totilo, the deal is valued at around $55 billion, and the next major step for this acquisition will be for all of the companies involved to get approval from the appropriate government regulatory bodies. “As of 2:03pm PT, EA’s shareholders have officially approved EA’s $55 billion sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund,” confirmed Totilo on social media. “The deal will next need to receive approval from government regulators.” The deal was originally announced all the way back in September, and involves a complete buyout of EA that will make the company a privately-owned one. As part of the deal, the current shareholders of EA will be paid $210 per share in cash, which is noted as being a premium of 25 percent over EA’s share price as of the market closing on September 25, 2025, when each share was priced at $168.32. “Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said EA CEO and chairman Andrew Wilson in a statement announcing the deal. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.” According to a more recent report, the deal will end up with Saudi Arabia’s PIF owning 93.4 percent of EA . Silver Lake Partners and Affinity Partners will end up with ownership of 5.5 percent and 1.1 percent of the company respectively. Before this acquisition, the PIF already had a 9.9 percent stake on EA. “This investment embodies Silver Lake’s mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” said Silver Lake co-CEO and managing partner Egon Durban.. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.” Proceedings surrounding the acquisition are expected to get completed in Q1 FY2027, and will result in the company’s shares no longer being listed on any stock exchange. Wilson will also continue in his role as EA’s CEO, with the company’s headquarters continuing to be based out of Redwood City, California.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Horror Game,"2025 was another great year for fans of things that go bump in the night, and so it’s fitting that we visit these nightmarish visions of gaming just before Christmas. Whilst much of the attention was focused on titles from some of the industry’s biggest names, it was another year with almost countless indie games that deserve more eyes and attention – although given that so many were released over the Halloween period I’m still working my way through them now. Our top three offers a glimpse of the range of experiences that are grouped together under the term of ‘horror’, starting with our thoroughly deserving winner. After years of disappointment and unremarkable spinoffs Silent Hill came back with a bang with Bloober Team’s remake of Silent Hill 2 last year. The increased focus on the series meant that Silent Hill f had far more attention and anticipation than would have been the case only a short while ago. Fortunately the game is fantastic and offers a whole new spin on the horrors of gaming’s foggiest of locations. While there was some controversy over the switch to Japan rather than the iconic town of Silent Hill itself, the narrative and complex puzzles quickly won players over. Set in 1960s Japan, in the fiction town of Ebisugaoka, you play as Hinako Shimizu, a high school student who finds herself trapped within a sinister fog (of course) and who must fight off terrifying monsters in order to find her missing friends. Alongside the shift in period and setting, Silent Hill f offers a far more involved combat system that owes a debt to Soulslikes. This debt is also shared with the drip-drop of lore, encouraging you to investigate every corner to find more information. Some puzzles absolutely require you to have found the right clues, so searching is essential. The horrific beauty of the design, the complex unfolding of the story over multiple playthroughs, and the terrifying atmosphere make this a worthy winner of this year’s award. Cronos: The New Dawn – Runner Up After the aforementioned Silent Hill 2 Remake, many previous critics of Bloober Team found themselves changing their views, and so Cronos: The New Dawn had a larger and more attentive audience than it might have had otherwise. Luckily the game was a fantastic fusion of Silent Hill and Dead Space that had enough ideas of its own to become a survival horror standout. The Silent Hill influences come from the dual environments – switching in time between a Polish town prior to and immediately following a mysterious event that saw the populace transformed into monsters. As for the Dead Space inspirations, the impactful combat here felt highly reminiscent of Isaac Clarke at his most brutal. The familiarity of the mechanics were combined with a fascinating science fiction survival horror narrative that saw you play as The Traveller, a helmeted stranger sent through time to retrieve the memories of key figures who could explain what had happened in the past. This time travelling mechanic led to complex narrative transitions and also gave everything an uncanny veneer of past, present, and future. While puzzles were mostly more simple than classic Silent Hill brainteasers, the excellent presentation and voice acting pushed players through to a satisfying (albeit ambiguous) conclusion. And I haven’t even mentioned that you get to rescue cats as you go! Navicula Meatus – Runner Up While both the previous games share a familiar DNA from classic survival horror (although both bring interesting new perspectives) Navicula Meatus is an indie game in the truest sense. The horror of this world is the horror of feeling completely out of place in a strange land. There is no interpretable language in Navicula Meatus – everything instead being portrayed through an impenetrable typescript and pictograms. Even working out how to get started is deliberately obscure as the main menu similarly has no words to guide you. Once you do get into the game you are confronted by a lo-fi aesthetic that looks like a mixture of classic Doom and dungeon crawler titles like Eye of the Beholder, and plays like it too, thanks to the minimalist keyboard-based controls for movement. This simplistic set of mechanics feels familiar and yet nothing else about Navicula Meatus is. You are a meaty bipedal crab of some description and must trade mysterious items with a host of similarly surreal and monstrous characters. Once this opening section is completed then things (somehow) get even more strange. While a very different style and vibe to this year’s other top horror games, Navicula Meatus is a truly unique experience that deserves a far wider audience. It is one of those games that you will either bounce off or become obsessed with, but give it a try and you might just find your new favourite indie horror.

007: First Light has been delayed by two months to May 2026,"IO Interactive has announced that 007: First Light has been delayed by two months to 27th May 2026. In a classic text image announcement on social media, IOI CEO and game director Hakan Abrak writes: “007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one. “The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game.” What’s a bit daft is that they only announced the previous March release date back in September , and just had a splashy cast announcement at The Game Awards, with Lenny Kravitz playing the villain Bawma . And then they’ve waited right up until Christmas Eve Eve to confirm this latest delay… I’ve no doubt that IO are very, very thankful that GTA 6 was recently delayed to the back end of 2026 , having previously been slated for 26th May 2026 . Otherwise the studio would have really painted themselves into a corner with 007: First Light wanting more polish. They’re pretty lucky to now have this extra breathing room. Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview , with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise. So… 007: First Light is coming out on 27th May 2026 across PS5 , Xbox Series X|S , Nintendo Switch 2 and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Racing Game,"As we speed towards the close of the year, we’re going to take a handbrake turn into our award for best racing game, so pop your seatbelt on (and let’s be honest, you really should be wearing one if you’re pulling a handbrake turn), ease off the throttle, and enjoy a drive-by of our top picks. It’s been a decent year for racing games, particularly in the arcade and kart racing genres, with the lighter end of the racing spectrum proving to be a big hit with our team, and the community at large. What can we say? The Nintendo Switch 2 needed a killer launch title, and Nintendo delivered it with Mario Kart World . That ‘World’ in the title is doing a good chunk of tone-setting, because it’s the first open-world Mario Kart game, and you can tootle off, driving across a huge island, and find the answers to all sorts of unknowable questions, like, where do Toads like to go for breakfast? And how long can I follow this Shy Guy for? It’s easy-going, and genuinely likeable, and you can explore the tracks and the larger world to your heart’s content, with Nintendo having filled the place with interesting little visual treats and gatherings that you can ruin by barrelling through them. Thankfully, the racing action itself is as tight as ever, and Grand Prix now see you racing between the different track locations, adding a new feel to each event. It is familiar, but when Mario Kart 8 gave us a decade of incredible racing, we probably shouldn’t feel too hard done by when Nintendo has chosen to do a bit of inventing too. The biggest and freshest highlight has to be the addition of Knockout Tour, bringing a Battle Royale flavour to Mario Kart’s already-brutal karting combat by whittling a larger-than-ever field of racers down through a series of areas, before ending in a four-racer battle to first place. It’s thrilling, frustrating, and unmissable, and you’ll keep coming back time and time again. Fast Fusion – Runner Up The Nintendo Switch 2 didn’t just get one arcade racer at launch, it got two, and Fast Fusion found its way into nearly as many hearts as Mario Kart World did at launch. How did it manage that? Well, it was priced incredibly competitively, an indie game that proved to be the cheapest game at the new console’s launch – no, we’re not including Welcome Tour here – and on top of that, its sci-fi racing was utterly brilliant, winning plaudits from critics and gamers alike. Framed within the same sub-genre as Wipeout or F-Zero, Fast Fusion is actually the latest entry in the Fast series from Shin’en Multimedia, who’ve continually rung both incredible performance and visuals out of Nintendo’s humble systems. Its colour-changing mechanic for boosting means you can never switch off through races, and the Fusion aspect that lets you combine vehicles means that you can create something that truly feels like your own craft. Fast Fusion looks and feels so good, you could almost mistake it for a AAA title. In our minds, it is one. Tokyo Xtreme Racer – Runner Up Here’s where the resurgence of arcade racers became clear in 2025. Alongside JDM, Tokyo Xtreme Racer returned us to the kind of racing game that epitomised the Dreamcast and PS2 era. In Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s case, that was the last time we had an entry in the series, with the most recent entry arriving all the way back in 2007. The brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer put us on Tokyo’s highways and byways let us loose, allowing you to challenge anyone you like to a race, beating scrubs, upgrading your car, and working your way through every possible rival. The racing is fundamentally unique too, built on a ‘stamina/tug-of-war’ system where the race is won by finding and maintaining a lead on your rival for a certain amount of time, and not just reaching a clear finish line. It’s got heaps of content, feels completely different from eveything else this year, and reminds us of a time when everything was simpler. In 2025, that’s as good as it gets. Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) NASCAR 25 Sonic Racing: Crossworlds Alright, that’s it for this award, and you’ll excuse us for not stopping before we race off to the next one. For some reason, we’re not allowed to drop below 50MPH, which would be rather scary if Keanu Reeves wasn’t on the bus with us.",2025-12-23T16:30:43+00:00,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/game-of-the-year-2025-best-racing-game/
Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties adds a new Bad Boy Dragon mode,"Ryu Ga Gotoku studio and their English localisation team are treading a very fine line with some newly revealed features and game modes for Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties . Revealed in a newly streamed showcase for the game are the Bad Boy Dragon mode for Kiwami 3, and Hell’s Arena in the Dark Ties bundled spin-off. Yakuza Kiwami 3 is a remake of the third game in the popular crime drama series, recreating the PS3 original with some modernisation and new additions. As Kiryu has to save Okinawa’s Morning Glory Orphanage from those looking to force him and the children out of their home, he’ll be able to jump into a new Bad Boy Dragon mode. Morning Glory and Bad (Boy) Dragon? Ahem! So, what do you do in Bad Boy Dragon? Well, basically, Kiryu joins and leads the Haisai Girls gang to dominance. You’ll gather allies and train them up until they can take on the toughest gangs in the country, fighting in turf wars for territory, jumping into Baddies Battles with a small party of five, or going for a 20-member battle in Rumbles. You can also hop onto your motorbikes and raid enemy bases. There’s a ton of customisation here that looks like it could be a fun timesink. Then there’s Dark Ties, which sees Yoshitaka Mine trying to bolster his reputation and rise through the ranks. This is a fresh side-story to the main Yakuza 3 tale, but RGG has now revealed the Hell’s Arena underground fight club that you can dive into. Your goal is to dive into 1v1 Hellish Brawls and perilous races to avoid hunters through a treasure-filled dungeon in Survival Hell. Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties is set to launch on 12th February 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S , Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.

Persona 3 Reload update 1.03 brings better Switch 2 frame rates,"Atlus has released an update for Persona 3 Reload on Nintendo Switch 2 , with version 1.03 promising improved frame rate stability and a new docked performance mode. One of the main criticisms of Persona 3 Reload for its Switch 2 release surrounded the performance of the game on Nintendo’s new handheld. Targeting 30FPS made sense, but with both the game’s demo and the full release, fans and reviewers alike noted that there were frame rate drops. Version 1.03 is the answer to this, and it promises to boost frame rate stability across both handheld and docked play at 30FPS. However, if you pop your Switch 2 into a dock to play on TV, then a new performance mode is available to target 60FPS, which is a pretty impressive jump up. This update will also be rolled back to the demo of the game, to help give a new and correct impression of what performance will be like. That’s expected in the coming days, but Atlus had better hurry, because they’ve put the game on sale with a 15% discount on the eShop through 4th January, and people will certainly want to wait and see how it holds up now. Here’s the brief patch notes for Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03: Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability In our review of the Switch 2 release of Persona 3 Reload, Nic said, “Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.” Source: press release",2025-12-23T13:56:03+00:00,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/persona-3-reload-update-1-03-brings-better-switch-2-frame-rates/
Pokémon Legends: Z–A Mega Dimension DLC Review,"Given how much I enjoyed Pokémon Legends Z–A — more than most people, if some parts of the internet are to be believed — I was really looking forward to the Mega Dimension DLC. The good news is that the best bits of Z–A are still there, along with a bevy of Pokémon missing from the base game and a slew of brand-new Mega Evolutions to keep things interesting. The problem is that getting between the exciting new bits is a bit of a slog. So, what is this DLC in a nutshell? Basically, after the near-apocalyptic ending of the game, a young girl called Ansha shows up with her friend, Hoopa, and asks for your help making some donuts. Being the do-gooder that you are, you accept — it’s honestly not the weirdest request you’ve had since getting to Lumiose, so you set about getting the one missing ingredient you need. Events transpire and you wind up in Hyperspace Lumiose — a sterile-looking pocket dimension mirroring a small chunk of the city you have just come from. The main difference between the real world and Hyperspace Lumiose, other than the very muted colour palette, is that the Pokémon here aren’t native to Lumiose. Oh, and they’re all over Lv100. Your first foray here sees you getting absolutely wrecked by a gang of over-levelled Mankeys. If you’re not already at or around Lv100, you’re going to really struggle, and thus the grind begins. Your goal now is to research Hyperspace Lumiose, use donuts to open hyperspace rifts, jumping in and doing three of a limited pool of missions. Pick up 10 shiny items, destroy 5 floating Poké Balls, catch 3 Pokémon, etc. The kicker is that you have a very short mission timer based on the quality of the donut you used, meaning that you have to work fast to finish the randomly generated map. Within each pocket you will find three different Pokémon, two of which you’re likely to have already, and the third being something unique to the DLC’s hyperspace Pokédex. Finding and catching these new Pokémon is, of course, exciting. It’s a little rough though that you fight them at over Lv100 and they’re reduced all the way back to Lv20 when you catch them. Sure, a lot of the thrill of Pokémon is in the chase, but when your Lv100 Feraligatr needs to use multiple attacks to take them down, you want to catch a Pokémon with some of its bulk remaining. Do enough research and you unlock the boss fight — a brand new mega evolution to call your own. These fights can be incredibly tough. While it’s 3-on-1, rather than the 2-on-1 of the base game, you still have the mission timer, alongside the fact that these things hit like a truck (no surprise when you’re fighting a creature at Lv140). Sure, your donuts give you a temporary level boost, but you’re not going to be matching their level. Fortunately, if you run out of time you can simply pick up where you left off with zero penalty, removing the difficulty of the actual boss fight. It’s obvious why this is the case — the game is tough as nails in these fights — but to me it underscores that the developers knew how frustrating these could be. Beat the boss and you unlock a new tier of pocket dimension, offering more Pokémon of higher difficulties, as you might expect having played the main game. Outside of this gameplay loop, what else does the DLC offer? There’s a string of new side missions using the new Pokémon you caught, but other than that, not much. So… is Mega Dimension good? Honestly, it feels like it would have been post-game content a generation or two ago, rather than a paid DLC. We’re no strangers to the grind in the world of Pokémon, but I’m struggling to find a time when the struggle felt like such a chore. The idea of randomly generated dungeons is cool, but we need a less intense timer and more variety (and colour) inside each one. Doing the same missions again and again in order to get to the next boss (and eventually the chance to try to find a Legendary Pokémon) gets a bit stale, pretty quickly. If you miss the chance to catch the Legendary, it’s worse still. The difficulty spike could also benefit from being toned down a notch.",2025-12-23T13:34:25+00:00,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-review/
Vince Zampella has died following a car crash,"Vince Zampella has died in a car crash, as has been confirmed by EA after initial reporting by NBC Los Angeles . According to the reports, Vince Zampella and a passenger were travelling along the Southern California’s Angeles Crest Highway in a Ferrari when the car came off the road and hit a concrete barrier, ejecting one of the passengers from the car while the other was trapped in the vehicle which caught fire, dying at the scene. The ejected passenger died of their injuries at the hospital. Vince Zampella has been a hugely influential figure in the games industry and is credited as one of the major creators behind Call of Duty, having founded Infinity Ward, releasing Call of Duty 2, and the breakout hit of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare which catapulted the series to being a household name. This was followed by Modern Warfare 2. Vince was fired from Infinity Ward by Activision along with Jason West, going on to form Respawn Entertainment, releasing Titanfall, Titanfall 2, Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. In 2020, Vince was put in charge of DICE Los Angeles and then in 2021 the entire Battlefield series. Leading tributes from studios, companies and people he worked for and alongside, EA issued the following statement to IGN : This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come. Our thoughts are with Vince’s loved ones.

Cronos: The New Dawn is getting an easier Temporal Diver Mode difficulty,"Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn is going to get a new Temporal Diver Mode, which will allow players to experience the game on an easier difficulty. Not much more detail has been given regarding exactly what this will do in terms of gameplay, with Bloober Team confirming more details will be provided in early 2026. A trailer for the Temporal Diver Mode has been released. Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people. Cronos: The New Dawn Review – Such is our calling In our Cronos: The New Dawn review, Steve said, “Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future. The clear influences from genre legends are combined with some original touches to make a game that feels familiar but also manages to innovate and surprise players too. The intriguing narrative, the enjoyable progression, and the challenging combat all combine to make an experience that cements Bloober’s place as horror specialists.” Source: YouTube",2025-12-22T20:41:25+00:00,Aran Suddi,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/22/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-getting-an-easier-temporal-diver-mode-difficulty/
Patapon 1+2 Replay gets Boss Rush Challenge mode as part of update 1.09,"Patapon 1+2 Replay has received a brand new mode as part of update 1.09, challenging players to take on the Boss Rush Challenge. To access the Boss Rush Challenge players need to complete the main campaign. The Boss Rush Challenge will vary the number of bosses per stage with higher difficulty, and they will get progressively stronger. HP and army strength will carry over through a stage and when a Patapon falls they will do so without dropping a cap, but all health will be restored once fully completing a stage. Along with the new Boss Rush Challenge, there are some additional fixes too. Patapon 1+2 Replay 1.09 update patch notes Graphics-Related Issues Fixed an issue causing unintended behavior in some text displays on the WORLD MAP in PATAPON and PATAPON 2. Fixed a graphical issue that occurred with some Patapon units in Patapon 2. Sound Bug Fixes Fixed a bug in Patapon where the “CHAKA” sound would not play when inputting the command for the “Earthquake Miracle.” Progression-Halting Bug Fixes Fixed a bug where performing specific actions when selecting save data would cause the game to become unable to progress. Fixed a bug in PATAPON 2’s HEAD QUARTERS where performing specific actions would result in unintended unit formations. Fixed a bug in PATAPON 2’s Paragate where performing specific actions would cause the game to become unable to progress. Other Bug Fixes Fixed a bug where certain key assignments would fail to register correctly in the key configuration settings within the OPTIONS menu. Fixed a bug in PATAPON 2 where some Patapons would not perform the correct animation when inputting the command for the “PON CHAKA Song (Charge).” Fixed a bug in PATAPON 2’s Paragate where camera controls would become disabled while the retreat dialog was displayed.

Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked Review,"Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked is a game that immediately charms you… once you’ve finished reading the dissertation-length title and start playing it. Taking the digital boardgaming of Demeo and mixing it with the setting and tropes of Dungeons & Dragons, it presents a light, fun and accessible entry into the preeminent world of role playing games. There’s two campaigns to delve into within Battlemarked, visiting the well-known regions of Neverwinter and Icewind Dale from the wider D&D world, both of which are on the cusp of disaster with the need for an adventuring party of heroes to step in and rescue the situation. This provides one of the biggest differences to Demeo, as the campaigns are more than just battling through multi-level dungeons. The stories pick up in a thoroughly traditional D&D fashion, you’ve got dialogue with other characters, skill check rolls to see if you can avoid battles, and a map of the region where you can choose between main quest locations, side missions and more to visit. With voiced narration and how each scenario is framed, it does a great job of capturing the structure and tone of a D&D adventure, even if the story itself is pretty rote and predictable. If you just want to dungeon crawl? Well, the two main dungeons from each campaign can be unlocked to play separately, though you need to beat them first. As with Demeo, everything is rendered as though it’s this gloriously elaborate tabletop RPG boardgame, moving static digital figured around the board, instead of having their limbs articulate to run around, rolling dice and seeing them bounce around the environment, but still having flames, water, lightning and more elemental effects shoot through the levels. Playing on a flatscreen, it might take you a good long while to realise that this board is actually situated within a 3D environment, catching little peripheral glimpses of hanging wall art as you zoom in, and then taking more control of the camera to look around. It’s there so that you’re sharing the same space as anyone that’s playing in VR, and a nice bit of continuity between the two modes. The fundamentals here remain the same as in Demeo, just with all the D&D classes, enemies and abilities now folded into the experience. That means that when you’re stuck in the thick of the action, you’ll have two action points per turn with which to move and to playing abilities from a hand of cards and items. As you look to attack, you’ll be rolling a bespoke 20-sided die which is all successful hits, bar for the one critical hit and critical failure. It’s a simplified rendition of role playing that’s much more like a dedicated boardgame than a turn-based RPG like Baldur’s Gate 3, and that keeps things nice and light as you go dungeon crawling and battling through throngs of enemies. And there really can be some big hordes that you face off against. When you get down into a dungeon, you’re working through multiple levels, searching for an enemy that holds the key to the exit, which you also need to find. Countless times, you’ll open up a door and find half a dozen enemies waiting for you on the other side – not least because dungeons have an endless spawn mechanic. Time it well within the turn order and you’ll have the drop on a cluster of enemies, able to then unleash chained magical attacks and control the zone of engagement, but do it with the last character in your turn and you could be put on the back foot. You can include four characters in your party, with a Dragonborn Paladin, Tiefling Rogue, Hallfling Wizard, and more in the line up of six defined classes. You sadly don’t have a full character creator, but can tweak the colours through their design, give them a custom name, and as you level up, have some limited ways to tweak the class build. You’ll put points from levelling up into the main class skill, and then chosen sub-attributes, picking from three options at each point, which can be chance-based boosts, additional damage, or even new skill cards. This isn’t the traditional RPG power scaling, but every little boost will help. You’ve got a hand of ten cards, unless you spend upgrades to expand it, and that includes the fixed abilities, as well as items. As you open chests in the level, buy them from a shop, and earn them periodically for dishing out damage, it can become a real juggling act, and you’ll often feel like you’re missing some of the best abilities. I regularly find myself dismissing cards I don’t want, and you’ll have to do this preemptively as cards earned are just chucked in the bin automatically if your hand is filled. It’s all part of the tactical management you engage in through battle, choosing when to open a chest for maximum benefit, or go back and use a healing fountain, how to use barrels and AoE attacks, when to delay a hero’s turn so that another can soften up enemies, and so on. Playing solo you’ve got a pretty full overview of the possibilities, but in multiplayer you’ll need",2025-12-22T17:00:52+00:00,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/22/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-review/
Game of the Year 2025 – Best Strategy & Simulation Game,"The first rule that you learn in business school is probably that you need to make sure to file your taxes on time, and while I’m sure there’s management games out there that do force you to do that, I’m rather glad that most strategy and business sims take a more lax approach. That really lets you focus instead on making your dreams come true, to see the birth of a nation and its rise to dominance, to build the very best museum for ghosts, to guide customers to their perfect book, and to hatch little baby dinos. All of which lead us to our winner… When I was younger I had two loves, the Jurassic Park film and the Zoo Tycoon video game. Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that later in life, Frontier would combine both of my biggest fandoms into one glorious park-builder video game where the player gets to create their own unique dinosaur theme park on an island just like Isla Nublar. What can I say? Life finds a way. What’s more, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is the best iteration yet. It refines and enhances every aspect of the previous two games, whilst also adding in new features like natural dinosaur breeding and improved terrain tools to keep things fresh. Whether it’s protecting the park from devious hackers or delighting your guests with exciting new tour options, Jurassic World Evolution 3 brings us a vibrant and fully realised simulation. It goes deep into the park management genre whilst still providing an accessible strategic experience that will delight old-school fans and newcomers alike. Also, there’s nothing better than adorable baby dinos. – Laura Europa Universalis V – Runner Up Releasing a new game in any big and well-supported strategy or management series is a bit like reading up on the endless sequence of patricide in Greek mythology. It’s not so much the rest of the genre that a new game has to compete with, but all the years of updates and expansions that went before. For a game like Europa Universalis V , it had to compete with and succeed a game that was over a decade old! But that provided Paradox Tinto with a huge opportunity to return to the game’s foundations, to reconsider many aspects of how things like population, government control and influence, market dynamics and wars all work. Importantly, they managed to do this while also still keeping a lot of the breadth and detail that had built up for EU4. There’s still plenty of room for expansion, but where it’s easy for a 1.0 launch to stutter and stumble, EU5 gets off to a great start. Two Point Museum – Runner Up If there’s one thing you know you’re going to get with a Two Point game, it’s bad puns, and if there’s a second thing, then it’s a charming management sim that’s been adapted to each new setting. From hospitals and universities, you now find yourself in charge of the museums of Two Point County, dusting off relics and old bones, gathering unusual flora and underwater fauna, and looking to build the best exhibits to draw in as many inquisitive minds as possible. And hopefully they’ve got some loose change to make a donation or two! Two Point Museum takes a familiar template and blends it with a new setting in delightful fashion, giving you more opportunities to customise and express your creativity than ever before. It’s full of humour and whimsy, and there’s already some great new themes and additions in the form of both paid expansions and free updates.

Assetto Corsa Rally gets an ice cold update 0.2 in Early Access,"The first content update for Assetto Corsa Rally has arrived, bringing an appropriate amount of snow and ice to the table for the season, alongside improved physics and performance. Available now, here’s what’s featured in Assetto Corsa Rally update 0.2. The physics engine within Assetto Corsa has been evolved in multiple ways, with the headline being the introduction of snow physics and support for studded tyres. This allows you to take on ice and snow rallies where grip is at its lowest, and you can test your skill at the new Ghiacciodromo Livigno Circuit, as well as in time attack and free practice for these mountain roads. And what better way to take this on than with the newly introduced Alpine A110 Group 4, which is an icon of rallying in the early 1970s? More broadly, the physics for gravel and tarmac racing have been improved alongside tyre models, and all vehicles benefit from fixes related to wheel offsets, rim textures, and suspension. The force feedback has also been made more consistent, especially for behaviour under braking. And the sound mix has been refined alongside new audio for snow environments and the A110. To try all of this out, there’s two new Events groups, so there’s now a total of 25 events in AC Rally. And then there’s just a litany of quality of life and bug fixing improvements. Here’s the full patch notes: NEW CONTENT: Added Alpine A110 Group 4 1973 Added “Ghiacciodromo Livigno” Ice Circuit Added 2 new ACR Events groups, and a total of 25 new ACR Events Added snow physics and snow studded tyres STAGES AND CIRCUITS: Added Ghiacciodromo Livigno Ice Circuit Added missing trees to backdrop areas throughout Saverne Improved collisions on some log piles in Saverne and Wales Fixed “that” traffic sign pole in the town of Saverne CARS: Added Alpine A110 Group 4 1973 Added studded tires Fixed issues related to wheel offsets Fixed missing textures on some rims Mitigated pixelated glows on car lights Added support for all country flags on air intakes Fixed suspension issues Fixed tire flex direction INPUT: Improved overall steering wheels support. We will keep improving the codebase until all steering wheel and sim-racing peripherals are fully supported and working Added Hat Switch (e.g. directional buttons) support for steering wheels Added double gear up/down inputs Added possibility to bind Neutral gear on steering wheels Added wipers input PHYSICS: Fixed FFB inconsistency with some cars Improved FFB under braking Fixed some FFB effects that were pushing the steering wheel on the wrong side Improved throttle to make it more linear with gas pedal Improved brake power for some discs and calipers Improved Gravel and Tarmac physics and tyre models based on new data that we acquired. Rally drivers validated the new handling. The tyre model will keep evolving during the Early Access based on new field research, data and feedback from players and rally drivers. Introduced Snow physics and Snow studded tires Improved the behavior of tyre model at extreme drift angles Retuned some differentials and some setup presets AUDIO: Added engine/exhaust sounds for Alpine A110 Group 4 1973 Added first implementation of Snow tyres surface audio Livigno Ice Circuit environmental audio setup Improved responsiveness of asphalt skid audio Improved vehicle scraping responsiveness Removed slowdown UI sounds in replay. Fixed issue with wall reverb being louder in cabin than external views. Moved rear engine emitters further forwards in surround mix. Many small audio mix tweaks across the game. GAMEPLAY AND UI: Added 2 new ACR Events groups and a total of 25 new ACR Events Fixed frequent crash after exiting the leaderboards page Fixes for Chinese language Increased ranges for camera customization settings Reduced allocated memory in race Added AI tires management to make AI times more accurate depending on race conditions Fixed start sequence cheat found by users Improved helmet camera movements Fix French Codriver issue with some calls having Left and Right inverted Fix Multiple text errors and typo Improved description for Differentials setup and Gear sets Fix UI not hidden correctly during replay and main menu Fixed Lithuanian Flag Improved time of day for each location to better reflect the period of the year New opening splash screen Fixed some road signs on Wales Hafren North and Saverne not reacting to physics Pace notes revision to Wales Hafren North and Saverne Reverse stages.

"No Rest for the Wicked co-op update comes in January with persistent realms, but you can play the beta now","Moon Studios has revealed what’s in store for their ambitious action RPG No Rest for the Wicked and the addition of co-op multiplayer. The studio is forging a rather unique path compared to other top-down action RPGs and Soulslikes, with persistent realms you can share with other players. The No Rest for the Wicked co-op update will arrive on 22nd January in full, but is currently in an open beta on Steam . That beta has now been extended to conclude on 5th January , so you can play all through the holiday. So what’s the benefits and reason to Moon Studios’ approach? Well, as outlined in the latest dev diary, there’s a distinct lack of permanence to a multiplayer session in many Soulslikes, and shared online spaces in games like Diablo 4 and Destiny have little meaning to them, just other people running around. But there’s something special about having clanmates to hang out with in an MMO, and so No Rest for the Wicked is blending all of this together. No Rest for the Wicked will let you convert any single player realm into a multiplayer one, making it a fully online and persistent instance of the game world. Within this you can have up to four players, and you can share this space fully with characters tied to the realm, or bring characters in from other realms. Being persistent, you don’t need a host player to be online, and so anyone can hop in, harvest materials, level up their character, buy property, and go to complete main quests. That obviously means that you do need to have a trusting relationship with the other players in your realm. The video showcases some of the shenanigans you can get up to, as studio director Thomas Mahler buys up a ton of property through farming progress and then trying to flip the property to the others, and then those others getting a little bit of revenge. For the more moment-to-moment action, Moon Studio also outline how you can really work together in play, having front line character, ranged builds and healers that can be great for tackling an imposing boss together. At the same time, enemy AI has been adapted to understand more about player positioning, able to react to flanking moves, or exhibiting some new attacks that you won’t see in single player. For the game as a whole, vendors will now have fresh gear to sell cycling in and out of their shops. Enchantments have been overhauled and higher level items get better rolls – but you now have limited rerolls – while weapons can now deal crit damage, and have random Facets to provide different stats. Socketing gems will now give fixed improvements, but there’s now higher tier gems. Exhalting (a bit like prestiging an item) needs you to have completely maxed out your item first, boosting a random item in a particular category multiple times. All enemies are now back-stabbable in combat (if you’re good enough), and bows have been enhanced with a new off-hand Quiver to introduce different arrow types (like blasting, explosive arrows). Oh, and for the high difficulty sickos out there, the highest difficulty now has more enemies than before. The game has come through a difficult year, with Moon Studios having to split off from publisher Private Division and go it solo , and with Mahler having a weird moment on social media . Since entering Early Access in early 2024, progress has also been steady as opposed to blistering, but with a big update earlier this year , and now the imminent addition of multiplayer (which will certainly have been a mountain to overcome), the future for this game is rather encouraging. No Rest for the Wicked is out now in Steam Early Access, with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions planned for when it’s good and ready.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Original Soundtrack,"Music really has become a huge part of modern gaming, the best examples not just elevating the game as you play it, but sticking with you as the original compositions lodge themselves in your mind to emerge while you’re doing the dishes, waiting in line at the supermarket or other incongruous moments. The difficulty with game music is just how varied it is. There’s sweeping orchestral scores, there’s jazzy chip tunes, there’s songs, there’s ambient music, regional influence and soundtracks that look to encompass hundreds of years of history. For us, as we tried to consume as many soundtracks as we could this year, there were some clear standouts, but we had to pick one. Of all the great video game music created this year, Ghost of Yotei’s really hits the high notes – this lacklustre pun absolutely intended. Composed by Toma Otowa, a multi-award-winning film and video game composer, the sweeping and beautiful compositions that accompany the player bring to life the world of Ghost of Yotei through a rich and culturally textured score. What sets Tomo’s work apart for Ghost of Yotei is the attention to detail, seamlessly blending traditional Japanese instruments (like shamisen, shakuhachi, biwa, and Ainu instruments such as tonkori and mukkuri) with Western influences. There’s even a delightful smattering of spaghetti western-style elements to the score, a perfect fit for the revenge story of protagonist Atsu. Overall, a unique cultural fusion is blended, managing to complement the bombastic gore-soaked action whilst also providing the quiet melancholy that underpins the sorrow-tinged beats of Atsu’s emotional journey. – Ade Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up It’s rare that I listen to a game’s soundtrack when I’m not actively playing the game, but then again Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a rare game. If you were to listen to the somber, melancholly of “Gustave” or the beautiful violins of “Firecamp – Sciel,” you might be surprised later when you hear “In Lumiere’s Name,” a tango for a battle with a mime, or “Is it a Gestral or a Volleyball?” which is at least as silly as it sounds. They could be from completely different games – though both French, obviously. Or perhaps the epic distorted guitars of “Une vie à peindre” would be more of a surprise? Much like the rest it, the soundtrack of Expedition 33 is emotional, whimsical, silly, heavy, and French all at once. The soundtrack is as varied as it could possibly be, from slow, morosely beautiful, smaller tracks perfect for the dramatic brooding over the most recent unbelievable revelations, all the way up to the huge heavy hitting boss battles that really get your heart pounding when you need to try and keep focused on parrying and dodging. Frankly, it’s a delight all the way through. It’s clear that composer Lorien Testard poured a lot of love into this soundtrack and it shows as, truly, one of the best I’ve experienced ever. – Gamoc Skate Story – Runner Up How do you soundtrack a game about a glass skateboarding demon on their way to eat the moon? If you’re Sam Eng and you’re making Skate Story , you draft in an entire indie band and let them loose on your gorgeous, existential exploration of the underworld. There’s a lot of leeway in what that might sound like, but with the neon, crystal-infused, ephemeral visuals, it made sense to bring electronica, synth, and a retro-modern outlook that speaks to the 1980s as much as it does the 2020s. This is a true album too. Skate Story Vol.1 is an auditory journey that’s as essential as the game it soundtracks, and you’ll find yourself travelling back to the half-places and looming edifices of the demon’s journey as you sink ever further into Blood Cultures’ retro-pop. – Dom Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) Europa Universalis 5 Fresh Tracks South of Midnight That’s this weekend’s awards wrapped up.

Something for the Weekend – 20/12/25,"With Christmas next week and how the weekends have fallen around it, we’ve made it through to what will be the final weekly round up of 2025.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Multiplayer Game,"2025 has been a huge year for multiplayer gaming. From big budget sequels in major franchises, to emerging genres like the extraction shooter breaking into the mainstream, and smaller, more experimental indie games, there’s been a little bit of everything for everyone to enjoy – so long as you enjoy other people, I guess. So, of all the headline-grabbing multiplayer games, both expected and unexpected, which came out on top? When Lethal Company exploded in popularity back in 2023, it triggered a major shift in the culture around multiplayer gaming – competitive argument-simulators like Jackbox and Among Us remain popular, but a new crop of games focused on chaotic co-op shenanigans emerged out of the woodwork. PEAK represents not only the best of that new genre we playfully refer to as “friendslop” – it represents the most fun you can have with a new multiplayer game this year, and it’s a major achievement in online gaming. The concept is simple: it’s a co-op game about climbing, and if you and your three friends have to try to scale the massive multi-biome summit laid out before you. Fail to do so and your run is over. The fluid, physics-based absurdity of the game generates a million laughs a minute, but even in downtime and defeat there’s fun to be had. The game smartly lets dead players not just spectate the remaining crew, but float around as adorable ghosts, berate the surviving climbers, and even get in their face and distract them a little bit. It’s a wonderful blend of friendsloppy chaos and genuinely well-designed systems that has made it the best multiplayer that money can buy in 2025. – Miguel Mario Kart World – Runner Up How do you follow up from near perfection? It’s a problem that you could argue Nintendo has faced many times over the decades, but was definitely true for creating a sequel to Mario Kart 8 . That kart racer had sat atop the genre for a decade, presiding over both Wii U and Nintendo Switch as the best-selling game, and being exceptionally well supported with DLC through the years. So how do you top that? Well, you don’t, really. You turn right and just go for a drive through the countryside for a while. Going open world is a huge part of what makes Mario Kart World feel new and different. In addition to having the many themed race circuits, they’re all joined up by a network of roads and environments that you can also race through – OK, that you have to race through because Nintendo decided to put really emphasise this. With larger lobbies, wider roads and more items, Mario Kart World is even more of a light party game than before. But then there’s the Knockout Tour, the Battle Royale racing mode that features huge map-wide races, eliminates players at regular intervals, and builds up to a real pressure moment to survive to the very end. It’s a lot of chaotic fun, perhaps a touch too chaotic, and with Nintendo’s typical quirks like not letting you party up for matchmaking (that they’ve thankfully tweaked in patches), but it remains an essential purchase for any Nintendo Switch 2 owner. Battlefield 6 – Runner Up 2025 was the year that Battlefield finally, well and truly, stuck it to Call of Duty . EA placed a huge bet in assembling a collective Battlefield Studios around DICE, and while some parts of Battlefield 6 have been a miss, the core multiplayer brings back a lot of the tone, feel and action that defined this series through the early 2010s. 64-player matches, defined classes, vehicular warfare are all here, and it’s great to get back to basics alongside some new and inventive game modes. Through launch and its first season, the main complaints to lodge against Battlefield 6 have been a lack of large-scale maps that defined this franchise, and Battlefield Studios’ annoying tinkering to shorten match lengths and reduce player counts, and (of course) some rather silly looking skins in the battle pass, and then backtrack when the community complains that this is stupid and not what they want. But the core is still there, and we hope that 2026 sees Battlefield Studios build and grow around that.

"The Division – yes, the first one – gets a PS5 update","Ubisoft have released version 1.23 of The Division, a game released ten years ago and superseded by the cunningly named The Division 2. The new patch does absolutely nothing apart from give PS5 players a 60fps mode. That’s it, nothing else, just a nice 60fps update for the *checks notes* five people still playing the game on PS5. The Division Heartland was meant to be the next game in the series but was cancelled by Ubisoft in 2024, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to IGN . The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects. That didn’t work out too well as XDefiant, Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter, officially shut down on June 3, 2025, just over a year after its May 2024 launch. Since then Ubisoft have been busy restructuring their business, starting by selling off five games to Atari, the games being Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. They have also delayed all their “big” games to allow them to be more polished, although they did not say which games these were, They have also been cuddling up with Tencent to create a subsidiary that will look after three of it’s biggest franchises, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry..

Greedfall: The Dying World is on the right track but still has a way to go,"It’s often said that you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, but this is precisely what developers Spiders are hoping to do with the most recent overhaul to their prequel to the cult favourite RPG, Greedfall . When it first launched in Early Access late last year the initial response was fairly negative, with many players left confused by its title suggesting a sequel, and many others left underwhelmed by the switch to a tactical turn-based combat system. To their credit, Spiders took this criticism on board and suspended their proposed roadmap in order to address the most pressing issues raised by players. I got the chance to have a hands-on look at the most recent build and can report that it is definitely improving. First up, I have to confess that my time with the new build was not the most optimal of experiences, playng remotely and with my connection suffering from frame rate drops and technical issues. I’m obviously looking past these hiccups, but it did mean that I didn’t really get to enjoy some of the later parts of the demo. That being said, I got to see enough to be cautiously optimistic that The Dying World can find an appreciative audience. The demo build contained three main areas for me to explore, with the opening section and two saves at crucial later parts in the story. The opening section of the game plays out similarly to the original version, with you playing the role as a native Teer Fradee. You get to familiarise yourself with the basic mechanics and immerse yourself in the traditions and beliefs of the tribes before coming into conflict with the colonial forces that are just starting to exploit the land. This introduction works well as a tutorial and my second time experiencing it highlighted the more streamlined and intuitive combat system. The most important change here is that you can now control your companions in a far more traditional style and queue up attacks to take advantage of their skills and abilities. Each character and class has a distinct set of skills, but it looks like you can diversify or specialise to your heart’s content as you level up. The setting and atmosphere of The Dying World are one of the real highlights as there is a rich and detailed sense of world-building here. Reams of optional lore and conversation choices are available for those who want to explore as much as they can and the game is not shy in highlighting the contrasts between the tribal traditions and the colonial powers that invade. This contrast comes into direct conflict at the end of the opening section and your player character is thrust into an entirely new environment. The two later sections showed different areas and recruited companions that really emphasised the game’s focus on cultural conflict and exchange. Each companion seemed to have an interesting set of characteristics and motivation for joining your adventure. Obviously the finer details were not available as I was thrust into the middle of quests and storylines, but it left me intrigued as to how the story would develop. Deeper into the game, combat felt more developed as the characters were appropriately levelled and had more abilities to balance and tactical approaches to take. The final section in the demo saw me return to the lands in which you grew up and this seems to suggest a clear connection between the conclusion of this game and the world of Greedfall. Unfortunately it was here that my connection to the stream became untenable, but in retrospect this wasn’t a bad thing since it leaves me itching to find out how the story develops. All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.",2025-12-19T16:00:18+00:00,Steve C,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/greedfall-the-dying-world-is-on-the-right-track-but-still-has-a-way-to-go/
Game of the Year 2025 – Best Independent,"The indie game scene is where you will always find the more experimental titles that big publishers may not feel comfortable funding. It is such a vibrant scene that allows smaller teams and individuals to really go all out. There were a number of outstanding independent games released in 2025, and it was tough to decide on a top three, especially with how muddy the waters can be when trying to determine what counts as “indie” and not, but having made our decision, it’s time to lick the stamp and send it. After coming up as runner up in our Best Narrative Award, Dispatch has taken the crown to be the best Independent game of 2025. It blends great classic Telltale like storytelling with an excellent visual presentation, and fun superhero management gameplay. AdHoc Studio’s debut title has managed to set a new bar for episodic games, the likes of which we have really not seen for years. Dispatch manages to take a rather normal segments of life, office politics and a dispatcher job, and turn them on their heads to provide a fun spin. Office politics are a lot harder to handle when you are dealing with beings that could cause you all sorts of problems without breaking a sweat. AdHoc has managed something many studios have struggled to do in the past, and that is balance fun gameplay with a great story, and a memorable look. Hades II – Runner Up It would be remiss of us not to have the sequel to our Best Independent Game 2020 winner as part of this list. While it can be argued that Hades II does not quite meet the same heights as the original Hades, very few games could do that. What we have in Hades II is a stellar sequel which saw resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths, and a more mechanically involved combat system all added to expand the system. Hades II also brought us a new protagonist, Melinoe, and a story which sees the Titans declare war on Mount Olympus. Everything is absolutely solid in Hades II and it is only that the story was slightly less engaging than the original for why this has game has not climbed to the top of our Best Independent mountain. Hades II didn’t beat what many consider the perfect game, but it came near close to matching its predecessor. Ball X Pit – Runner Up Ball X Pit is what you would call a mad mashup of ideas that works really well. Developed by Kenny Sun and some friends, it takes brick breaking, base building, and ball attacks to mix it all up into one of the most entertaining roguelikes of the year. It is a fast paced and intense experience with balls flying everywhere as you fight off waves of monsters. Balls can be fused to make new ball loadouts that have various effects, and you also need to rebuild Ballbylon so you can get even more power ups in your fight to beat the monsters. Ball X Pit is a game that is very hard to put down once you have started your run, the action and need for quick thinking definitely grabbing your attention. Add in the colourful and bold action on the screen with the engrossing gameplay, Ball X Pit is an indie game that has captured a huge audience that just want to unload their balls. Honourable Mentions (in alphabetical order) Cloverpit Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo Hollow Knight: Silksong Phew! That’s a pretty big one out of the way.

Manor Lords update adds new maps and game modes,"Slavic Magic has released a major new update for Manor Lords, its medieval strategy game, with the update adding a new option to choose starting locations, new maps, new buildings and jobs associated with them, ladder climbing for units, and a whole host of changes for resources. Additionally, policies have been removed temporarily from Manor Lords as they require additional development time. You can check out the full list of changes below. Manor Lords Update 5 Version 0.8.029–0.8.050 patch notes Major Changes Starting Location Selection : Ability to select the starting location in the game setup screen for the player and adversaries. New Maps : Devil’s Hill, Jagged Cliffs, Divided and Lake Lemm. New Game Modes : Duel (1 vs 1 with AI) and Fractured Realm (4 Lord free-for-all). New Buildings, Jobs & Resources : Quarry, Stonemason, Lime Kiln, and their connected resources: Rough Stone, Dressed Stone, Mortar. Wall Positioning : A new system for positioning units on walls. Ladder Climbing : Units now climb ladders to access higher floors. Hover Fortifications : The player can now hover the castle fortifications and see the soldiers inside. Gate Control : Added the ability to open and close each castle gate individually. Castle Upgrade System: Module Upgrades : Every castle module, including walls and gates, can now be upgraded to lv2. Placement Logic : Module placement is no longer restricted by distance to the nearest major module. The planner now displays the total Bailey Area. The Bailey area allowed for construction is limited by your lord’s or lady’s Rank (still WIP). Wall Platforms : You can now attach platforms to the castle walls. The level of platforms is capped by the wall type. Affinity System: Environment Types : Each Region is divided by area into multiple Environment Types: (Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Urban, Rural). Building Affinities : Different buildings can have Affinities with different Environment Types, for instance, the Animal Pen has a “Pannage” Affinity which decreases the time to yield for Pig Pens relative to the Woodland area. Maintenance System: Workplace Maintenance : A lot of workplaces now must be maintained by delivering resources to function properly. Failure Risks : Failure to maintain a building can result in various risks, such as collapse for mines, injury and even a minor death chance. Rate Tuning : You can tune a workplace’s level of maintenance, affecting Labor Speed. Yield System: Yield Definition : Yield is a measure of how much your workplace produces. Various buildings use different timespans and benchmark values depending on their nature. Yield Influencers : Yield can be affected by Labor Speed, Efficiency, and Productivity. Labor Speed : Labor Speed measures how fast your workers perform workplace related tasks. Efficiency : Efficiency measures how much output you get per input when crafting, per plant when farming or per passive income cycle, depending on the production type. High Efficiency means your Gardens will produce more Vegetables and your Crafting tasks may produce extra items. Productivity : Productivity is a measure of your logistics: transport and labor times vs idle times, sickness, extension work and militia assignments. Approval Rework: Memory Weight Shift : Approval memory weight was shifted to dramatically favor current events versus past events. Approval Tiers : There are now 7 approval Tiers. Landing in a specific Approval Tier will give various penalties and bonuses to growth, influence, income among others. Food Resource Rework: Food Categories :All foods now fit within food categories; Foraged Goods, Meats, Fishes, Vegetables, Grains and Animal Produce. Burgage Plot Requirement overhaul : Burgage Plots now require a variety of foods from different categories, encouraging more diverse variety as they upgrade. Expanded Vegetables : Vegetables resource was split into Cabbages, Carrots and Beetroots. Expanded Orchards : In addition to Apples, Pears and Quinces were added as new Orchard options. Expanded Meats : Meat was divided into: Mutton, Chevon, Pork, Beef, Chicken, Small Game, and is produced by their respective animals accordingly. Expanded Fish : Fish was divided into Carp (from ponds) and Eel (from rivers). New Food: Milk is passively produced by Goats for the Animal Produce category. Wild Animals : Deer were replaced by Small Game since it’s more plausible in historical terms. Small Game also yields Pelts, which is an early trade commodity. Foraged Goods : Alongside Berries, Mushrooms have been reintroduced as a Foraged Good. Honey : Honey is no longer consumed. It is intended for use in a future update, but for now can be sold, while the Apiary Extension boosts the yield of Farms and Orchards through the Pollination Affinity. Regional Development System Rework: Development Perks : To a lot of players, the development tree was a weak point of the game and described as immersion breaking. Therefore, a new, more grounded system of Develop",2025-12-19T14:34:25+00:00,Aran Suddi,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/manor-lords-update-adds-new-maps-and-game-modes/
Mintrocket reveals new details for Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC,"Mintrocket has released a new developer diary to mark the end of the 2025, with game director Jaeho Hwang giving details on what has been happening at the studio and what to expect going forward. We get a look at Mintrocket’s new office, but the main area of concentration is Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC which is due out in early 2026. Dave The Diver Into The Jungle is expected to have around 10 hours of new content for players to experience in the jungle village of Utara. Here Dave can spend his day helping villagers with their requests, or gathering fruit and minerals. If that doesn’t take Dave’s fancy there’s a new restaurant to visit that is run by Bancho. Here Dave can help serve multiple customers, with these customers being people Dave has built relationships with. The restaurant is not called Bancho Sushi, as the fish in the freshwater lake cannot be served like that, so instead the restaurant is Bancho Grill. When Dave The Diver goes diving in the jungle lake he will have to watch out for threats like crocodile, catfish, electric eels, and piranhas. However, Dave is not an easy snack for these predators as he comes armed with the new Jungle Gun, which has multiple forms including shotgun, netgun, sniper rifle, and a regular gun depending on the danger. On land, Dave can wander the jungle with friends and experience different jungle themed minigames including what seems to be a guitar hero style rhythm game. In addition, there has been confirmation there will be guest characters from other games in the Into The Jungle DLC, but Mintrocket has not said who. Furthermore, Mintrocket has announced it has partnered with XD to bring Dave The Diver to mobile devices. The mobile version is not going to be a straight port of Dave The Diver, with the UI and controls redesigned for the mobile experience. Dave The Diver Mobile will be released in China first with a global release to follow soon afterwards.

"Cleared Hot Chapter 1a is out now, adding the RAH-66 Comanche","Not Knowing Software has released Chapter 1a for Cleared Hot, its take on the classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The major addition as part of the Chapter 1a release is a brand new helicopter, the RAH-66 Comanche, which is an agile craft but is susceptible to taking damage rather quickly. That is not the only addition, with a new test flight area, and more fixes. Plus Cleared Hot is now confirmed as Steam Deck Verified. Cleared Hot Chapter 1a update Survival Mode This area has a handful of small mini-game modes that we are exploring. In survival mode you defend a building from waves of enemies, with health and ammo dropped in between waves. You get a cash reward for reaching the half way point and for completing the stage. Defense Simulation This just sends waves of enemies straight at a target. The enemies don’t progress and there is no ending. Standoff Range Spawns both friendly and enemy NPCs and sends them into a battle. Other Areas There are a lot of other areas for you to play with. Demolition Playground Physics Playground Standoff Range Shooting Range Vehicle Range Turret Range Radar Turret Range New Options Screen Shake – You can now adjust how much screen shake is applied (in game options) No Blood / Gore / BBQ Meat – You can now disable blood and gore. The NPCs will no longer explode into various cuts of meat after being killed by rotors or certain weapons. Active Debris Limit – Added a slider for the maximum number of physics debris pieces that can be active at a time. Lowering this will help performance in certain CPU bound situations, or really destruction heavy levels. UI FPS Limit – We’ve added an option to limit your FPS while in the game UI, to prevent melting any graphics cards unnecesarily :) Cloud Save -We also added cloud save. So you can keep synced between your various devices. Keep in mind that with the current implementation, the game syncs on quit. So if you want to swap devices, quit out of your current session before switching. Steam Deck Verified – Cleared Hot is now Steam Deck verified, woohoo! This update came through last week but we didn’t announce it publicly. Various Fixes Improved: Boss music logic so it fits better with the different phases Improved: Sfx on collision performance for props Imprived: Collision damage performance for destructible props Fixed: camera starting sometimes in strange positions Fixed: bug where you could change to different UIs in the homebase when selecting helo ending up with a broken ui Fixed: updated a few props to use the proper collider Fixed: Configured the rope pickup in some props so they work better when they spawn rotated Fixed: Mouse was hidden when using “Quit to menu” option while in a mission Fixed: Warehouse destruction model fixed so the broken parts don’t kill units inside Fixed: Hind passenger stat now match the actual number of passengers supported ingame Source: Steam",2025-12-19T13:39:54+00:00,Aran Suddi,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/cleared-hot-chapter-1a-is-out-now-adding-the-rah-66-comanche/
It’s Hello to Jason Isaacs as he joins the Tomb Raider series,"Amazon MGM’s live-action Tomb Raider show has signed up another Hollywood star with Jason Isaacs joining the cast in an undisclosed role. Given that he is English he could be playing Lara’s father or more likely, the bad guy. Isaacs was recently seen – quite explicitly – in The White Lotus where he played Timothy Ratliff. He has also voiced one of the villains in Baldur’s Gate 3 He will be joining Sigourney Weaver who has confirmed herself that she will also be in the show. Phoebe Waller-Bridge will be writing and executive producing the series. Lara herself will be played by Sophie Turner. Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018. Turner said she was “thrilled beyond measure” and that “[Lara Croft is] such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got.” Source: Deadline",2025-12-19T12:51:30+00:00,Tuffcub,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/its-hello-to-jason-isaacs-as-he-joins-the-tomb-raider-series/
"What We Played – Aaero2, Silent Hill f & Demeo X D&D","Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but your backlog is so delightful, that you will certainly have something to play over the holiday period. Are you waiting for something new under the Christmas tree? Or will you hunker down and play your favourite titles as that’s just a little more cosy. I’ll be continuing my own cosy return to Monster Hunter World, which has come back into regular rotation thanks to the fact that the end game is still more satisfying and in depth that Monster Hunter Wilds. That said, there’s a new update there, so I’ll check that out over the weekend too. Besides that, I’ve really enjoyed Neon Inferno , Rogue Trader, Aaero2: Black Razor Edition and Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked with Tef which has kept things pretty varied. Jason was the first to pop in, and he’s been playing Shape of Dreams, calling it, “A really fun roguelike with MOBA-style abilities you can customise with gems and a really nice aesthetic.” That’s not all though, as he continued, “I’ve also downloaded a bunch of games to my Steam Deck, and am hoping to get through some Shadow of Wardor too in the brief window of time off I have.” Tuffcub has returned to his regular stomping ground by playing Destiny 2 just a little bit, but he’s mostly playing the annual favourite “How do I keep both my mother and the mother-in-law happy over Christmas.” He’s also been playing a game of ‘getting the stupidest gifts possible.’ He explains, “My cat is giving my boyfriend a year’s supply of antihistamines as he’s allergic to cats.” Sounds pretty thoughtful for a cat. Having finished Dispatch this week, Gamoc said, “It’s great, but too short and too episodic! Playing through it is like playing MGS5, with all the repeating credits and stuff.” He’s also tried a litany of things: CloverPit (Balatro for slot machines), News Tower, Megabonk, This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker (an idle clicker with cards and poker hands), Destropolis, and Mycopunk, with the latter he said, “It seems really good but my PC barely runs it.” He also played ‘starting Stranger Things from the beginning since it’s now finally finishing’. His review? “Pretty good.” Aran has been playing Star Wars Outlaws. He says, “I’ve only had it since last Christmas… I’m enjoying it just exploring the planets, flying around space, and completing contracts as I go.” Next up was Ade , and told us, “Along with playing the roguelike Wizards of Legend 2 with Laura (surely we must be getting close to defeating the first boss?!) I’ve also been on with the online coop shenanigans of Warhammer 40k Darktide (such a fun game!) And Metroid Prime 4.” He continues, “With Metroid Prime, I really can’t decide if I like it yet! Exploration is as brilliant as any other game in the series but there’s also a lot of fairly weak combat to slog through. Also, I can’t get over why this advanced species of psychic aliens are obsessed with motorbikes, so much so that the suit they’ve given to Sames makes her look like she’s competing in the Isle of Man TT. It’s a bit weird.” Steve has been getting back to clearing some of his physical media as he spent time in bed recovering from his bout of flu. What did he get up to? “I set up my 360 on an old monitor with headphone output and ploughed through the boring God of War clone Hellboy and the Science of Evil (only to discover that the real ending of the game is locked behind DLC that is no longer available…). I then started Quantum Theory which is the most 2010 game ever. Lots of Gears of War corridors and waist-high cover. In less physical gaming I played through some demos that were lurking from the last Next Fest to clear some hard drive space. And finally, I sat and played Sword of the Sea through which was a wonderfully chill and meditative time with awesome visuals and music.” Laura received a lovely treat from Ade: unadulterated horror! He thoughtfully bought Silent Hill f for her birthday this week. She said, “It’s been great fun going straight from Silent Hill 2 into playing the new one. I’m loving the traditional Silent Hill vibes but set in 1960s Japan. Everything I loved from 2, with spot-on tweaks to the gameplay elements. A birthday treat indeed!” Jim has been dipping in and out of a few games this week. I started by finishing up Ghost of Yotei which doesn’t have the most exciting ending, but I’m looking forward to exploring the open world and cross off some more bounties. I’ve now started playing Mafia: The Old Country which does an excellent job of slowly easing you into its early 1900s Sicilian setting – it’s been a couple of hours and I still haven’t fired a gun! Speaking of guns, I pulled the trigger and dove into Arc Raiders. For a PvP extraction shooter, the other players I’ve come across have all been surprisingly friendly, leading to cool impromptu encounters, helping each other take down Arcs and haul our loot to the exit zones.

Game of the Year 2025 – Best Puzzle Game,"As Dr. Kawashima’s low polycount face reminded us all in the early 2000s, working out the brain is important to keep it sharp, and there’s one genre that works out your brain more than others. At least you would hope so, and that is the puzzle genre. The puzzle genre is wide in scope, with experiences that range from simply putting pieces together to other experiences where you need a notebook to write down everything so you can refer back them as things get more complicated. Our winner is definitely on the complex side of the puzzle genre. Blue Prince is a massive achievement in the puzzle genre, providing an experience that just has so many layers to it. What seems to be a simple premise of finding a way to a secret room in a mansion, eventually spirals into a major multiroom and multirun experience where anything in the environment could be a clue for something else. Blue Prince is a game that has spawned whole communities working together to figure out the different conundrums that pop up, from uncovering switches to open new areas, to working out what certain objects across different rooms actually mean and deciphering their importance. Blue Prince is the ultimate puzzle game of 2025, and it will be one that confounds new players for years to come. Lumines Arise – Runner Up Enhance and Tetsuya Mizuguchi have seemingly made it their mission to make games about making blocks disappear in a sense overloading explosive celebration. The team smashed it out of the park with Tetris Effect in 2018 and has now shifted focus back to Mizuguchi’s own Lumines to revolutionise it for a new generation. Lumines Arise takes the puzzle element of building up your score by repeatedly forming blocks of matching colour, and presents it in such a way that you become utterly engrossed in the action. Lumines Arise is a stunning audio and visual package which doesn’t just provide an environment in which to solve the puzzles, but pulls you to be enveloped by music and art which are as essential to each puzzle as the blocks themselves. Lumines Arise is proof that puzzle games can be some of the most breath-taking games imaginable. Is This Seat Taken? – Runner Up One of the biggest social challenges we face pretty early on in life is finding a place to sit, be it at school or family gatherings. Choosing a seat is more than just finding a comfortable place to plonk yourself, it determines who you could be interacting with for the duration of being seated. And what if you sit somewhere when the person already sitting there wants to be left alone? Is This Seat Taken? takes that situation and makes a game of putting people in the correct seats while they go on a journey. Is This Seat Taken? is a nice and simple premise that creates ever increasing challenges as you figure out where people should be seated, while keeping everyone happy. If you have ever done a seating plan for a party or wedding, you know how difficult that is. The game gives you different issues to deal with. Someone might be very chatty and want to sit with someone who will indulge them in conversation, while someone else might be a bit smelly so hardly anyone wants to sit by them, and some people will want to be left alone. While not the most difficult of puzzle games Is This Seat Taken is certainly unique, taking a relatively normal part of human life and turning it into an engaging experience.

Neon Inferno Review – The new run ‘n’ gun king,"If you’ve been gaming for as long as I have, there’s now a period of your gaming life that falls into the ‘classical’ era. The 8-bit and 16-bit consoles forged gaming as we know it today, with 2D sprites and burgeoning 3D techniques transporting us to worlds we’d previously only imagined. Zenovia Interactive want you to remember those days, with their latest title, Neon Inferno, set to revitalise the 2D run ‘n’ gun genre, while leaning on modern technology to make this one of the best-looking side scrollers of recent years. Angelo Morano and Mariana Vitti are assassins waging a war for The Family. This conflict has you facing off against the Yakuza and the corrupt NYPD, working your way through the enforcers and low-level cops, on your way to the people at the top. As a run ‘n’ gun game, the overarching gameplay is instantly recognisable: run from left to right, shooting in eight directions, while ducking and jumping out of the way of the blizzard of incoming bullets. Neon Inferno has a keen eye for where to update the classic tropes, though, adding in a slick parry ability that sends bullets hurtling back to where they’ve come from, as well as an all-new feature that lets you fight on two planes. You’ve got one standard button for shooting, while the secondary one shifts your focus to the back of the screen, altering the gameplay to a shooting gallery. You move your reticle around to dispatch all the villainous bad guys, and it becomes a real challenge shifting focus back and forth between the two. It’s a clever idea, not only breathing new life into the genre, but taking familiar concepts and merging them into something new. Well, new-ish. Layered on top of that is bullet time. Using your ability to parry bullets, you can then hold the button down and enter a slow-motion state where you can utterly redirect those bullets in any direction you want. These redirected bullets also deal more damage, so it becomes a crucial technique in your arsenal, slowing the action, and sending bullets careening around towards different enemies. Where Terminator 2D: No Fate aims to be a ‘lost’ licensed game from the era, Neon Inferno takes the classic run ‘n’ gun form and gives it a modern refresh, throwing a variety of gameplay mechanics in, and somehow, making them work as a cohesive whole. The different stage ideas are effortlessly cool, with early highlights including a motorcycle chase, and a club battle where civilians are getting in the way, leading to a showdown on a smoke-filled dancefloor. These consistent, exciting shifts give Neon Inferno a cinematic, action-packed feel. It’s all just so damn stylish. The animation and art direction are absolutely brilliant, with Cyberpunk vibes and neon-infused 2D styling that riff on elements of Streets of Rage , all the way through to Cyberpunk 2077 . It perfectly ties in with the engaging, if straightforward, storytelling, digging deeper into the criminal underworld you’re part of. I love the way it’s undoubtedly fooling you into thinking this is how games used to be, but while I can categorically say that they weren’t, there are perfect nods and callbacks to games of yesteryear. Add in the energetic soundtrack from Gonzalo Varela and Qwesta, which blends old-school Blade Runner synth tones and sax with aggressive guitar riffs and the occasional high-quality vocal, and you’ve got one of the most surprising games of the year. It is fair to say that Neon Inferno isn’t messing around. The standard difficulty selection is on Hard by default, and this gives you fewer checkpoints and lets you take fewer hits, making sure you don’t misunderstand how tough games like this used to be. There are two easier-going options, for those who want to experience the game without the risk of snapping your controller in half. The middle option gives you a decent challenge, without feeling unfair.",2025-12-18T16:20:08+00:00,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/neon-inferno-review-the-new-run-n-gun-king/
"Samson’s main story will last around 10 hours, console versions confirmed","A couple of weeks ago Samson was revealed by Christofer Sundberg’s Liquid Swords studio, showing a gritty open world game set in the city of Tyndalston. The main story sees Samson in a mountain of debt so he needs to take on all sorts of jobs to try and clear it, or suffer the consequences. Now, a new FAQ about Samson has gone live, with the key points being the story is about 10 hours but exploring everything can take around 25 hours, and the game will be coming to consoles but after the PC launch. The Samson FAQ has also confirmed that the game is expected in early 2026 and will be priced at $24.99. There is no multiplayer and no microtransactions, with Samson being a single player title. There will be localisation, with different languages steadily being rolled out, but this will only apply to text as voice acting will not be localised. For the gameplay, players will be able to unlock new perks but won’t have a standard weapon loadout. Instead items in the environment can be picked and used for fights, while vehicle combat will also be heavy and a core part of the game. There has been some influence from Just Cause, the series Christofer Sundberg is credited with creating, but not in the chaotic and silly sense. It will be much more grounded with outcomes that could be unpredictable. You can drive any car in the game, but you won’t be able to drag civilians out of their vehicles. Instead stealing cars that are parked seems to be the way to get a new ride, though this will draw attention. Each vehicle will have its own handling style, which then leans into each one being useful for different playstyles. According to the FAQ the city will respond to Samson’s actions too. It says, “Law enforcement escalates based on your actions. Civilians react to what you do and how you behave. For example you need to watch out if you steal a parked car, if the police are nearby, they will spot and pursue you. They’ll escalate their efforts as you try to shake them off, making for an intense experience, testing all of your skills and knowledge about the city to escape. The city responds. It does not just sit there.” It goes on to say this about police chases. “Law enforcement is something to respect. Chases escalate, pressure builds, and mistakes matter. The goal is tension, not spectacle for its own sake.” The PC minimum specs have also been confimed for Samson and they are: OS: Windows 11 Processor: 6 cores Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card Storage: 15 GB free space Source: Steam",2025-12-18T16:12:36+00:00,Aran Suddi,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/samsons-main-story-will-last-around-10-hours-console-versions-confirmed/
Helldivers Movie Lands Fast & Furious Director Justin Lin,"Helldivers is preparing to launch a dropship to a theater near you via an upcoming film adaptation, and it just landed a big-time director. Justin Lin, best known for directing several installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, will helm the project. Per The Hollywood Reporter , the Helldivers movie comes from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with Justin Lin’s Perfect Storm Entertainment helping produce. Lin’s credits include directing most of the installments in the Fast & Furious series, starting with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and continuing with Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), F9 (2021), and Fast X (2023). According to THR ’s sources, Lin is not a gamer and is leveraging this in his pitch to “find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.” The script for Helldivers is penned by Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the It and Annabelle franchises, as well as The Nun . Dauberman also wrote this year’s Until Dawn , so Helldivers will be his second video game adaptation. Helldivers 2 Given that Helldivers is essentially a video game version of the cult classic film Starship Troopers , turning it into a movie does feel like the snake eating its tail. Helldivers centers on soldiers hailing from Super Earth, an uber-patriotic managed democracy, who defend the planet in an intergalactic war against alien bugs, as well as killer robots and other threats. The first game was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, and Helldivers 2 arrived on PlayStation 5 in 2024 to widespread acclaim and popularity. The Helldivers movie does not have a specific release date or window. In the meantime, check out our reviews for Helldivers and Helldivers 2 .

Paramount Announces A New 'Sonic Universe' Film For Holiday 2028,"Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel. Per Deadline , all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively. Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4 , scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it’s not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion. Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ Knuckles series? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Game Director David Grivel Rejoins Splinter Cell Remake After Leaving In Late 2022,"It's been nearly four years since Ubisoft announced its Splinter Cell remake , but the developer doesn't have much to show off quite yet, outside of a few pieces of concept art . Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA. “Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I’m rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!” Grivel’s LinkedIn post announcing the news reads . “A very special team and project to me,” the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji. (Thanks to GamesRadar , which noticed this post before we did. ) According to his LinkedIn profile, Grivel worked at Ubisoft from 2011 to 2022, spending most of his time at the Toronto offices as a senior or lead game designer, with credits on projects like Assassin’s Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, 6, and Primal, and most importantly, Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting. Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it’s unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it’s a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here’s hoping we’ll see a more concrete update sometime soon.

Dragon Quest Reimagined Producer On Remaking A Classic: 'We Rebuilt Everything From The Ground Up',"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the latest game to grace the cover of Game Informer , and to learn more about this game for the cover story, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to play two hours of the game and interview the team behind it, too. With this being the second remake of Dragon Quest VII, following the 2016 Nintendo 3DS remake, I was curious about where you even start with a project like this.&nbsp; So I asked producer Takeshi Ichikawa and director Masato Yagi about their thought processes behind developing the game, which elements are sacred ground in Dragon Quest VII, if there’s any pressure involved, and more. Here’s what I learned. “To be honest, I did feel some pressure, but for the most part, I felt the same as Ichikawa here,” Yagi tells me. “I was excited with the idea of bringing these new changes.” Ichikawa, on the other hand, didn’t feel much pressure. “I was certainly excited with the prospect of bringing these changes,” he tells me. “When we first kicked off the project, we had in mind three main components that we really wanted to reimagine for this version; the first one being the visuals, the second one being the scenario or the story, and the third one being the battle. […] It is one of the most popular installments in the series, but our goal was to offer a reimagined experience to players all around the world. But again, I didn’t really necessarily feel pressure.” When I ask where the team started with Reimagined, Ichikawa explains it’s a remake focused on showcasing what makes Dragon Quest VII so great to modern audiences. That means keeping the story intact, although lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi explained to me in a different interview how the team streamlined the main scenario; you can read about that here . “I really thought that the story of the original was essential to keep,” Ichikawa says. “When you look at [all of the] mainline installments, Dragon Quest VII’s story is quite unique and not really like the others. These characters […] go through a lot of struggles, and it is, overall, kind of a bit darker. That [darkness] is the one thing that I wanted to retain for sure in the remake.” Yagi agrees with Ichikawa, telling me in a series full of lighthearted stories with a more loving tone, Dragon Quest VII is darker. He remembers asking, “Is this actually a Dragon Quest story?” while playing the original game on PlayStation. Retaining this tone was important for Reimagined, he adds, lightly dipping into spoiler territory to discuss Prince Kiefer, a party member of the game. I won’t spoil anything here, but if you’re familiar with the game, Kiefer makes a crucial decision in the story, and though in the initial stages of development the team pondered keeping it (and other narrative moments) in the game, it remained. “That’s definitely one thing that we were debating if we should keep or not, but in the end, we decided it’s just too essential for the story,” Yagi says. “There are a lot of areas where we debated to keep or not keep, but in the end, for the most part, we decided to keep [things in place]. But it’s not keeping them as is. We did end up making some little adjustments and arrangements here and there.” Speaking more broadly, Yagi says the team behind Reimagined “really wanted to make the overall game experience more immersive for our players [and that’s why we streamlined the story. It’s also why we made some adjustments to the combat.” Closing out our conversation on the philosophy behind this remake, Ichikawa tells me, “Reimagined” implies everything is new. He says, “We really built everything from the ground up. We rebuilt everything, aside from the scenario, from scratch. In order to convey that sentiment, we felt that ‘Reimagined’ would be the most adequate title instead of ‘Remake.'” Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.

Bungie Shares Deep Dive On Star Wars-Inspired Destiny 2: Renegades,"Bungie today offered a deep dive look at the new Destiny 2: Renegades release, which is scheduled to arrive for players next week, on December 2. The new major release for the game is an unusual one, as it’s rooted in a partnership with Star Wars. A quick look through the early visuals of the game don’t leave much room for doubt on that, as there are lots of things that look like lightsabers, stormtroopers, and villainous Sith. But as today’s vidoc makes clear, Bungie is trying to thread a more nuanced line with this release that it first appears. While plenty of features may look like Star Wars, the team is going to great pains to make sure it remains a true and canon Destiny experience. Those aren’t lightsabers but rather Praxic Blades. Those aren’t stormtroopers but instead members of the surging Barant Imperium. And that’s not a Sith – it’s a dangerous new big bad named Dredgen Bael. Whether the developer can pull off keeping those distinctions or not will be a matter to decide once we can play the game, but the early descriptions and footage offer good reason to be excited. The storyline appears to focus strongly on Drifter as a central character, acting as a conduit into some of the criminal underworld of the solar system. With his scoundrel demeanor, Drifter pretty clearly nods a bit toward characters like Han Solo in the Star Wars fiction. We also get to know a character that has been mentioned in the past in written lore entries for Destiny. Aunor Mahal is about as close as the game is likely to have to a Jedi, with her Praxic Blade that she is using to fight against Dredgen Bael. Players will pledge to a faction and build up reputation as they fight across the Lawless Frontier, an explorable space with a dedicated social hub in the form of Tharsis Outpost. Factions include the anarchist Eliksni biker gang called The Pikers, the group of sentient Vex call the Tharsis Reformation, and the rogue Cabal called Totality Division. You’ll run jobs for these factions like smuggling, bounty hunts, and sabotage-focused missions. While Aunor is shown in some pretty slick lightsaber-esque battles, NPCs aren’t the only people getting fun new Star Wars-themed toys to play with. Players will also be able to wield Praxic Blades, and will even be able to try out different fighting styles, very much like a Jedi. With the exotic primary, kinetic Praxic Blade, you can deflect attacks, melee attack enemies, and even throw. And, just to set clear expectations, Bungie has shared that the Praxic Blade won’t be unique to this content drop; it will continue to be a relevant weapon in future expansions to the game. Renegades also introduces new Blasters inspired by Star Wars, including several distinct variants, from dynamic blasters that hit harder with brute force, to more fast-firing balanced blasters. Blasters overheat and must cool down, rather than have a traditional magazine reload. We also learned about a special solar exotic crossbow called Heirloom, inspired by Chewbacca’s weapon in the movies. Players will also be able to pick up different “renegade abilities,” that seem in some way to tie together with the faction you work for. Across all the new content Bungie showed off today, one of the features that stood out the most was the music. By drawing direct inspiration from the Star Wars scores, arguably some of the most extensively varied and beloved of all film music, the new Destiny themes that were part of this preview presentation were, quite simply, riveting. The Renegades experience may be worth returning to play if only to hear more of that great music in action. There’s plenty more to learn in the complete rundown. Check out the full vidoc below to get a comprehensive look at what Bungie is cooking up. Destiny 2 continues its march into the future with Renegades on December 2.

"Yuji Horii On Final Fantasy: 'When I First Saw Final Fantasy X, I Recall Feeling This Was The Ultimate Perfection'","Dragon Quest launched in Japan in 1986, and a little over a year later, Final Fantasy launched in 1987. Though the two are now sister RPG franchises at Square Enix, before the 2003 merger between Square and Enix, these series were competitors. And if you ask fans, they might use a word like rivals.&nbsp; I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, last month to visit Square Enix’s Shibuya offices, play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined , and interview the team behind the remake for Game Informer’s latest cover story . But as part of this trip, I interviewed Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii for 90 minutes about all kinds of topics, including the aforementioned competition between his franchise and Final Fantasy. He didn’t call it “competition,” as I did, but admits, “I was definitely paying attention to it.” “Way back then, when Final Fantasy originally came out, I was definitely paying attention to it because it was something we needed to look out for,” Horii tells me. “But there’s one key difference that I really saw back then: the protagonists in the Final Fantasy titles, they speak a lot. Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves. “In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you’re not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games. So I thought that was a really interesting and stark difference between Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, but I didn’t necessarily see them as a rival back then.” Horii says in Dragon Quest, protagonists don’t “just start talking on their own.” “Final Fantasy, again, [the protagonists] just talk a lot,” he continues. “I do like Final Fantasy, though. When I first saw Final Fantasy X, I recall feeling this was the ultimate perfection of Final Fantasy.” Great taste, Horii. Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.

FX Announces Far Cry Anthology Series Coming To Hulu From Alien: Earth And It's Always Sunny Creators,"FX is developing an anthology TV series adapting Ubisoft’s Far Cry franchise. The upcoming show will stream on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally. According to a press release, the series will “retain Far Cry’s signature standalone storytelling format” and each season will take place in a new setting and star a different cast. Far Cry is being helmed by executive producers Noah Hawley, creator of FX’s Fargo and Alien: Earth , and Rob Mac (formerly McElhenney after a legal name change this summer), creator of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia . Mac, who also co-wrote and stars in the FX docuseries Welcome to Wrexham and Apple TV’s Mythic Quest, will join the cast of Far Cry in the starring role. “What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley in a press release. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.” “Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” said Rob Mac in a press release. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.” Far Cry 6 Far Cry ’s executive producer credits also include names from various production companies, such as Emilia Serrano (26 Keys), Nick Frenkel (3 Arts), Jackie Cohn (More Better), and John Campisi. Ubisoft Film & Television executives Gerard Guillemot, John Campisi, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill are also involved. FX’s Far Cry has no premiere date or announced cast besides Rob Mac. Whether it’s the 2010 Prince of Persia film or the 2016 Assassin’s Creed film, Ubisoft has never been shy about bringing its franchises to the big and small screens. Far Cry already has a TV show to its name in the form of 2023’s Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix , an adaptation of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. There is also the terrible 2008 Uwe Boll Far Cry film, but perhaps that is best forgotten. Other recent Ubisoft adaptations include a live-action Assassin’s Creed series currently in development by Netflix, and the animated show Splinter Cell: Deathwatch , which premiered on Netflix in October, is nominated for a Best Adaptation trophy for this year’s Game Awards . For more on Far Cry, you can read our review of its most recent entry, 2021’s Far Cry 6, here .

Why Is Sega Saturn So Hard To Emulate?,"Sega went all-out during the 5 th console generation to dethrone Nintendo and deal with the upcoming challenger called Sony. Compared to its 16-bit predecessor, Saturn delivers a massive leap in processor technology. However, this increased speed came at the expense of complexity which made the console quite hard to develop games for. Why is Sega Saturn so hard to emulate? It boils down to two primary factors, the first of which is the complicated multi-processor design that incorporates dual Hitachi SH-2 microprocessors along with six other coprocessors. Secondly, the Sega Saturn utilizes quadrilateral polygons instead of triangles to render 3D graphics . Despite its immense processing power and forward-looking design choices (CD-ROM drive), Sega’s 5 th gen console was a commercial failure. Sega kept its development under wraps and barely communicated with third-party developers who didn’t get enough time to train on this overly complicated system. As a result, Saturn didn’t have nearly enough launch titles to help it compete against the PS1 and Nintendo’s upcoming N64. Why Is Sega Saturn So Hard To Emulate? If you take a look at consoles from the 5 th generation (between the mid to late 1990s), none are as hard to emulate as the Sega Saturn. It’s quite puzzling how complex the emulation for this console is because much more powerful consoles from the 6 th gen (like PS2) are emulated relatively easily. Right now, if you’re using a PC you only have a couple of reliable emulators that will run a majority of Saturn games without performance issues. SSF, Yabause, and Mednafen are all fairly good at Saturn emulation. But there are still some games that generate glitches, crashes, etc. while running on these emulators. And given how powerful any modern PC is, one wonders why we are having so much trouble emulating a 32-bit console from the 1990s. The answer lies within Saturn’s plastic shell. Open it up, and you’ll find a motherboard that looks like a small city filled with electronic inhabitants and skyscrapers made out of silicon. There are a total of 8 microprocessors in the Sega Saturn, each responsible for handling various tasks from graphics to sound. Modern consoles integrate the CPU, GPU, and I/O management into a single package. Audio is also handled by this main processor. But back in the day, lithography processes weren’t advanced enough to integrate so many functions into a single chip. And it was cheaper to solder a bunch of existing chips onto a motherboard than create an all-in-one processor from scratch. Sega wanted a next-gen console fast, and they wanted to do it with existing technology. So they took two Hitachi SH-2 32-bit processors, a Motorola 68EC1000, a sound processor, and two video processors, and slapped it all onto a single board. Then, they added a Yamaha FH1 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to handle FM synthesis and pulse code modulation for Sega Saturn’s 32-channel audio. Even the CD-ROM drive has its own dedicated processor in the form of a Hitachi SH-1, to compress load times. Finally, you have a System Control Unit (SCU) chip to coordinate communications between all the buses (it also has an internal DSP). Imagine if you can, the nightmare of recreating all this lunacy inside a virtual environment. Which is what emulator developers have to do. And they must also conduct various tests/ optimizations to make sure that this emulator works across an infinite number of PC hardware configurations. What Is The Best Emulator For Sega Saturn? If you’re on PC, the best standalone emulators are SSF, Yabause, and Mednafen. I also recommend you give RetroArch a try. It’s not an emulator, but a general-purpose GUI frontend for all retro consoles/ arcades. Within RetroArch, you can download “cores” for various systems. The best Saturn core within RetroArch is Beetle. Alongside the core, you’ll also need a BIOS file. Is Sega Saturn Stronger Than PS1? There are areas where Sega’s Saturn trumps the PS1, and there are areas where the PS1 is stronger than the Saturn. When it comes to 2D graphics, the Sega Saturn was more than a match for PS1. Thanks to its dual Hitachi SH-2 processors clocked at 28.6MHz (PS1 has a single R3000 clocked at 33.8MHz), Saturn has more theoretical processing power than PS1. However, harnessing the full potential of Saturn was very hard because of its complexity. Saturn can also draw more pixels, and do it faster than PS1. That’s because PS1 relies on its polygon engine while Saturn draws pixels through hardware on the processors. PS1’s Geometry Transform Engine (GTE) was an excellent video processor for its time. But if Saturn’s VDP1 and VDP2 are used in coordination with the SH-2 processor and DSP, they could outperform PS1 in terms of geometry processing and polygon fill rate. In essence, Saturn has more potential power but it’s a lot harder to tap into unless you’re a genius developer who’s had sufficient time to train on the Sega Saturn. Is Sega Saturn A Bad Console?",2023-10-04T19:39:15+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/why-is-sega-saturn-so-hard-to-emulate/
10 Best DOS Golf Games That Are Worth Checking,"What DOS golf games lack in graphical fidelity, they more than compensate for with realistic simulation of things such as terrain and wind. Some of these are more arcade-oriented than others, skirting the laws of physics in the interest of fun and spectacle. No matter which type of golf game you prefer, I’ve got quite a selection for you to choose from. Here are the 10 best DOS golf games that are worth checking out. Because these games are so old and from a relatively obscure subgenre, finding detailed information on them can be very hard. Fortunately, you can just go to an online DOS games website and give these a try in your browser to decide whether you like them or not. Links 386 Pro Back then, most DOS golf games of the simulation variety were made by just one developer- Access Software. Links 386 Pro is part of their Links series, which began in 1990 with “Links: The Challenge of Golf”. This is the sequel to that game and was released just 2 years later with a few extra features. If you purchased the CD version for your PC, you could enjoy audio commentary by Bobcat Goldthwait. He acted as your caddie, constantly making sarcastic quips and comedic interjections between plays. The CD version also includes an aerial flyby shot of each hole, streamed in real-time from the disc. Mean 18 It’s not as simulation-focused as Links 386 Pro, but Mean 18 still features 3 famous courses. It has Augusta National, Pebble Beach, and St. Andrews. If you want, you can even create a custom course using the level editor. Controls are fairly simple; you execute a complete swing with just 3 mouse clicks. With the first click you initiate the swing, power is adjusted by clicking a second time, and the third click lets you decide between draw or fade. There are two difficulty modes- beginner, and expert. PGA Tour Golf Despite being one of the oldest golf games on my list, PGA Tour Golf looks and sounds excellent compared to its peers who had the advantage of using newer technology. The game has three courses- PGA West, TPC Avenel, and TPC Sawgrass. These are actual courses, but the developers also included a fictional course called Sterling Shores. Four game modes are available- Tournament, Driving, Putting, and Practice. What makes this game amazing is that you get a 3D view of each hole before the shot, after which the camera gradually pans over to your character’s location. Wind physics is a thing, and replays are automatically played for good shots (you even get audio tips from PGA golfers). World Class Leader Board Golf While it’s a golf game from the legendary developers at Access, few played it even back when it was new. It simply didn’t get as much attention as the much more well-known Links series of golf games from the same developer. Nevertheless, this is a very fun game and simulates complex details such as wind, terrain features, etc. You must try to dodge all the water holes, rough patches, and bunkers. There are three real courses in this game- St. Andrews, Cypress Creek, and Doral Country Club. There is a fictional fourth course, along with a level editor so you can craft your own course. Links: The Challenge of Golf The very first Access Software game in the Links series, it set the benchmark for several years to come in the simulation golfing genre. While the game has just one course- Torrey Pines South, it makes up for this fact with plenty of detail in every aspect. For instance, there’s an overhead map function that lets you see the whole course and place a contoured grid on top. It even has audio commentary that reacts based on the dynamic nature of your performance. You can watch replays for every single shot, both from where you hit the ball and from where it landed. And finally, this is one of the earliest golf games to have a multiplayer mode. Harvey’s Zany Golf A complete departure from the simulation-style golf games that we’ve been reviewing up until now, Zany Golf is an arcade-like recreation of miniature golf. Just like in real-life mini golf courses, you’ve got plenty of obstacles, banked turns, and drops. To shoot your ball, you click on it and pull back in the opposite direction, much like charging a slingshot. Once you’re satisfied with the power and angle, you let go. Sometimes, there will be fairies on the course that reward you bonus points for striking them. If you complete one hole fast, you can get more time for the next one. World Tour Golf Created by the same team that did Mail Order Monsters, World Tour Golf is inspired by Nintendo Golf (which the developers were playing after they finished Mail Order Monsters). This game is a hodgepodge of ideas and code. Its graphics are based on an internal EA bitmap editor, which would later become Deluxe Paint. While the game didn’t have a bunch of courses, you could create as many as you wanted with the level editor. Some of the more cartoonish fictional courses in this game are a callback to Racing Destruction Set, another EA game that had",2023-09-30T12:55:07+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/best-dos-golf-games/
15 Best Dos Games To Play On Android,"Being able to emulate old DOS games is amazing, but even more so if it’s on the go. There are a few Android DOSBox versions that will play all your favorite retro games just the way you remember them. You can use onscreen controls, or connect a keyboard + mouse, which is the preferred way of playing if you’re at home. To help you get started, here are the 15 best DOS games to play on Android. Some are old-school shooter games that control surprisingly well on a phone, others are platformers that seem like they were made for this type of handheld gaming. So without further ado, let’s get the list started- Quake It’s an evolution of the Doom formula, with real-time 3D rendering and hardware acceleration support via OpenGL. The Quake engine was designed from the ground up to facilitate an entirely new generation of FPS games. Quake had a unique aesthetic, inspired by medieval and gothic culture, with a darker tone compared to Doom which felt like an action game. While Doom initially had just local co-op and deathmatch, Quake featured online multiplayer from the start. It revolutionized competitive shooters in the same way that Starcraft 1 revolutionized the competitive RTS scene. Some of the world’s first “pro” gamers on PC were in fact, Quake players. Heretic It’s a medieval wizard fantasy version of Doom, with a slightly more developed plot and new gameplay features. You can look up and down, which lets you scan the environment much better for traps and enemies. Speaking of the environment, some parts of it are interactable, unlike Doom where the environment is a static mesh. In Heretic, you’ve also got an inventory system to manage all your potions and power-ups. If you get the morph-ovum, it can be used on nearby enemies to transform them into harmless critters. There are weapons modifiers like the Tome of Power which adds a secondary firing mode to your weapon, one that’s often more powerful while also adding a new visual effect. Dangerous Dave John Romero created Dangerous Dave in 1988 as a practical example to accompany his article about GraBASIC (an Applesoft BASIC addon) in the UpTime disc magazine. Yes, disc magazines were a thing back then and they were awesome. More to the point, this game has no right to be as good as it is, considering that’s a glorified tech demo. For Dangerous Dave, Romero took heavy inspiration from Mario. You have a simple 2D side-scroller, going from left to right, and your main character can jump. There are gold cups to collect, monsters to defeat, and secret rooms to find. Albion Albion is a late-stage DOS game that arrived in North America in 1996, after its initial German release just one year prior. What makes it unique is the sci-fi setting that incorporates elements of magical fantasy. Originally intended for the Amiga, it had to be reworked for MS-DOS because Commodore went bankrupt. For a simplistic DOS game with a relatively low budget, Albion’s story and world are quite richly detailed with several interesting characters and memorable locations. It’s a party-based RPG, and you have a total of 6 members per party, each with unique abilities. Gameplay centers around exploration, dialogue, trading, and puzzle-solving. Commander Keen Possibly one of the most fun games you can play on your Android phone, Commander Keen is a side-scrolling action platformer. Its titular character is the alter ego of Billy Blaze, an 8-year-old genius who travels through space to fight evil and solve mysteries. There are 6 episodes, separated into 4 games. Gameplay involves jumping across platforms and using your pogo stick in strategic locations to jump even higher with proper timing. You aren’t defenseless, like the protagonists of some other platformers. Commander Keen is armed with a raygun, which comes in handy if your pogo jump doesn’t work on an enemy. X-COM: UFO Defense A turn-based tactics game with some real-time management elements mixed in. UFO Defense puts you in charge of a secret global paramilitary org called X-COM, its task is to defend planet Earth from an alien invasion. You build teams of operatives to carry out missions around the world. In addition to the turn-based tactics, this also plays like a 4X grand strategy game. You monitor X-COM bases using a global map, request new technologies be researched, allocate additional fighter jets and military units to hot zones, etc. All the while, you’re also recruiting new personnel and reverse-engineering alien tech (or selling it on the black market). The Secret Of Monkey Island Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert came up with the idea for Monkey Island in 1988 after he was frustrated with the difficulty of contemporary adventure games. He wanted a game that was primarily about exploration and worldbuilding, solving puzzles, engaging in conversations, etc. So he took the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride as inspiration and collaborated with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman to create this game in the SCUMM engine.

15 Best Retro Games To Play On Steam Deck,"Ever since Valve launched its handheld gaming system in early 2022, the Steam Deck community has been trying to run all sorts of games on it- both old and new. Thanks to Valve’s open-source approach to software design with SteamOS, you can run a variety of emulators on this little “console”. Nearly every major 6 th and 7th-generation console game will run smoothly on the Deck, so you’ve got many options for retro gaming on this system. Today, I shall take a look at the 15 best retro games to play on Steam Deck. The ideal retro game for Steam Deck is one that lets you do meaningful progression in short 20 to 30-minute play sessions, and it must look on a small display. Old RPGs and platformers are perfect because they can easily hit a locked 30/ 60FPS via emulation, even on the Steam Deck’s relatively anemic processor. Mario Kart 64 A game that defined an entire console generation, Mario Kart 64 combines moment-to-moment fun with gameplay that’s deeper than you might think. It can be enjoyed solo, or with up to 3 friends if you connect some wireless controllers to your Steam Deck. Remember, this is all running via emulation so there’s no guarantee that you can make it work on EmuDeck . If you can’t get the multiplayer to work, Mario Kart 64 has decent enough AI to keep you entertained (they still rubberband and cheat like crazy). The graphics are nothing to write home about, yet something about the way this game handles character art and vehicle models stands out. In an age of derivative game design, it looks unique and instantly memorable. Of course, you can hook up your deck to a large display (like a monitor or TV) and enjoy the game as originally intended. But it looks very good even on a small screen. There are eight playable characters divided into 3 weight classes, each weight class has different stats for vehicle acceleration and top speed. Ratchet & Clank By 2000, at the turn of the century, Insomniac had become a household name within the PlayStation community with their successful Spyro series about a friendly little dragon. With the PS2, they introduced gamers to Ratchet and Clank- a dynamic spacefaring duo comprised of an anthropomorphic alien and his robot sidekick. At its core, Ratchet and Clank is a 3D action platformer in which you have tons of gadgets, cool weapons, and diverse enemy types. You solve puzzles, navigate through harsh terrain filled with traps, and complete missions across various exotic locations. It’s Tomb Raider in space with 20 times the gadgets and weapons, and a very stylized art style. A more entertaining formula if you ask me. Metal Gear Solid 3 With PS2 emulation, Metal Gear Solid 3 performs very well on Steam Deck. You can even play the remastered HD edition, released for PS3, using RPCS3. I suggest you play around with the render settings to see what suits you best, OpenGL and Vulkan are the two best APIs for this game on RPCS3. As for gameplay, Metal Gear Solid 3 doesn’t glitch or lag at all on the Deck. You can fiddle around with the controls and remap them so that the touchpad works as Circle and Square. Because the touchpads on Steam Deck are pressure-sensitive, you can use them for aiming or hostage control just like in the PS2 version. Resident Evil 4 RE4 is the primary reason behind the popularity of the 3 rd person action-adventure shooter during the mid-2000s. This game along with Gears of War made that genre, so it’s easy to take the current crop of 3 rd person AAA shooters for granted. But the Resident Evil series wasn’t always like this, it used to be a proper survival shooter with narrow hallways and tiny rooms. RE1 and RE2 had fewer enemies, and they gave you way less ammo so you had to plan all your actions beforehand. Your character wasn’t as mobile as Leon in RE4, and fixed camera angles helped create more tension by limiting your situational awareness. Despite all this, RE4 became the best-selling game in the series pretty much right after its exclusive release on GameCube. People loved the action movie vibe and revamped combat system. If you’re going to emulate this, I suggest giving both the GameCube and PS2 versions a try since they do have subtle differences. Textures and lighting are better on GameCube, but the PS2 port has additional content (like the Separate Ways campaign featuring Ada Wong). GoldenEye 007 The N64’s controller was weird and awkward to hold. But it did have a feature no other controller offered at the time, and that was an analog stick. GoldenEye 007 made excellent use of this stick by letting you aim with it and even went one step further by supporting a dual controller setup. You’d hold two controllers, one in each hand, and use the left controller for movement while the right one handled aiming. So technically, GoldenEye was the first game to use a dual-stick layout, not Halo: CE. Thankfully, you don’t have to go through all that trouble when you emulate GoldenEye 007 on Steam Deck. Halo: Combat Evolved For a moment, let’",2023-09-28T11:15:17+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/retro-games-to-play-on-steam-deck/
15 Best DOS Action Games That Are Worthwhile,"Action games these days are usually limited to the 3 rd person variety, with an open world that’s wider than the Pacific Ocean yet shallower than a puddle. Compare this to DOS action games from 3 decades ago which came in every genre conceivable, from platformer to shooter. And I’m not just talking about first-person shooters, but also 2D top-down shooters that involved tanks and spaceships. Today, I shall take a look at the 15 best DOS action games that are worthwhile. No matter your preference, you’re guaranteed to find an action game here that appeals to your fantasies. Whether it’s a shooter, brawler, fighting game, platformer, RPG, sports title, or hybrid- DOS has got it all. Rise of the Triad If you look at the cover art for this game, it seems like you’re about to play some kind of tactical espionage shooter in which you infiltrate secret bases. There’s a guy with a WW2-era SMG and a girl who’s shooting off into the distance while holding a guard who’s been knocked out. And you know what, the game is indeed about spying. You’re part of a special forces team known as HUNT, tasked with monitoring and sabotaging the operations of a deadly cult that’s headquartered on a remote island. Unlike most other shooters of the 1990s, you can pick from a selection of five unique operators, each with distinct attributes such as speed and armor. Enemies behave unpredictably, sometimes they will beg for you to spare their lives, and other times they will pretend to be dead and ambush you from behind. Depth Dwellers What makes Depth Dwellers unique is the fact that it was originally intended to be used with 3D glasses. Remember guys, this is a DOS shooter from 1994. Over a decade before 3D became a thing in PC gaming (remember those overpriced gaming monitors with NVIDIA 3D support?). The game’s levels are set in underground caves that are filled with mechanical opponents and various treasures. Your goal is to get to one of the many teleportation gates that act as exits for the level while collecting as many secret items and treasures as possible. Sometimes, you’ll even find slaves who can be freed for bonus points. Little Big Adventure One of the earliest games in the action-adventure genre, Little Big Adventure has a very distinct graphical style. It meshes 3D polygonal characters with prerendered 2D environments, to create a “2.5D” effect. The game is also quite cinematic, with FMV cutscenes interspersed between important junctions. It should be noted that FMV cutscenes, fully voiced dialogue, and high-quality music are only present on the CD-ROM version of this game. Your player character is shown from an isometric viewpoint and has 4 behavior modes- normal, sporty, aggressive, and discreet. Combat is done by throwing magical balls of energy at enemies, and your abilities will vary depending on your behavior mode. Redneck Rampage Stylish, funny, and filled to the brim with high-octane action. This game is an interactive version of that terrible Hollywood movie from 2011 called Cowboys & Aliens. If you ever wanted to see cowboys fighting off an alien invasion with their double-barrel shotguns and six-shooters, don’t watch that movie, play this game instead. Magic Carpet It’s no Microsoft Flight Sim, and you control a carpet instead of an airplane. But some people prefer carpets to planes. And the experience of being a wizard on a flying carpet who goes around sieging castles full of armed guards is executed very well. You visit 45 different worlds, with the simple task of building a castle in each one. After building a castle, you must empower it with mana. There is a fixed amount of mana in each world, which is gained primarily by blowing up the castles of enemy wizards. MDK A game that was ahead of its time and had some truly monumental system requirements as a result. MDK required a 60MHz Pentium CPU or better, along with 16MB of RAM. This would have put it at the top of the most demanding games chart, making it the Crysis of the 1990s. All these system requirements weren’t for nothing, as MDK boasted some extremely large levels and highly detailed character models. It looked and played like nothing else, letting you switch from 3 rd person view to 1 st person if you equipped your sniper rifle. You can use a parachute to glide between large gaps in levels and call airstrikes on enemy objects. MechWarrior 2: 31 st Century Combat MechWarrior is a game about giant stompy robots, set in the 31 st century where humankind has expanded hundreds of light years into space. The BattleMechs is a revolutionary new weapons platform that provides superior firepower, mobility, and protection compared to normal armored fighting vehicles such as tanks. The game is set in a universe where rival space nations have been at war with each other for hundreds of years. It features tactical mech combat showcased from a first-person view of a pilot sitting in the cockpit. Missions take place on giant open-ended levels. Your mission objec",2023-09-20T16:49:00+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/best-dos-action-games/
30 Best DOS Puzzle Games That Are Worth Checking Out,"DOS has its share of entertaining puzzle games, some of which are hybrids that combine platforming or adventure with puzzles. One nice thing about playing old puzzle games from this era is that the art style carries the experience where the graphical fidelity fails. And in a puzzle game, you don’t need photorealistic graphics or fully voice-acted cinematic cutscenes. Today, I bring you the 30 best DOS puzzle games that are worth checking out. If you want, you can download DOSBox to play these games (a lot of them are now abandonware). Pipe Mania If you like Snake, you’re going to love this game. It’s not an infinite-growth puzzle like Snake. Instead, each level places a minimum length requirement on you and once you exceed that limit you can advance to the next level. What you have in Pipe Mania is a dispenser churning out green goop, which must be linked through empty squares to form a pipe. This pipe shouldn’t run into the boundary or itself. You cannot rotate pieces as they drop in, and there is a slight delay as the goop flows into the pipe pieces you’ve arranged. The Fool’s Errand A story-based meta-puzzle game in which you play a character from Tarot, the Fool. You’ve been given a map by the Sun, which contains several jumbled pieces and your goal is to find 14 lost treasures that are scattered all around the world. During your journey, you pass through 4 different kingdoms where NPCs give you clues on how to find these treasures. The Fool’s Errand plays like an interactive storybook and contains several visual puzzles. Each puzzle is unique, it’s like playing a series of minigames. And the type of puzzle you solve is directly related to the story’s progression. For example, the result of a crossword might give you a clue on which location to visit next in your search for the 14 treasures. The Incredible Machine I’m sure we’ve all seen those children’s cartoons with incredibly complex devices that perform simple tasks. Like Tom rigging up a trap with 500 different moving parts that stretches across the entire hallway, just so he can drop a ball on Jerry’s head. These types of devices are called Rube Goldberg devices, named after the American cartoonist who made them popular. The Incredible Machine is a puzzle game in which you design Rube Goldberg devices to perform simple tasks. You must set off a chain reaction of gears, bands, pulleys, bars, etc. to put a ball in a box or turn on a light switch. For each level, you’re provided with an assortment of seemingly random tools and creatures that have certain affinities for other objects (mice run toward cheese). The Island of Dr Brain Dr. Brain is a talented scientist with grand plans for a new project that will change the world. However, the battery he developed to power his machine has been stolen from the island and you must go there to retrieve it. As the player, you navigate your way around increasingly complex booby traps and safety systems set up by Dr Brain. This is an educational action-adventure puzzle, similar to Castle of Dr. Brain (which was released just a year ago by the same company). To complete the puzzles in this game, you’ll need basic knowledge of things like elements on the periodic table, music, literature, etc. It’s excellent for kids and adults alike. Secret Island of Dr Quandary Developed by MECC, it has no relation to The Island of Dr. Brain as both of these games are set within entirely different realities. However, this is also an educational action adventure in the same vein as Sierra Online’s puzzle games. You’ll need to solve puzzles that test basic maths and critical thinking skills. Everything starts at a carnival organized by Dr. Quandary, where you win a doll by participating in a shooting event. However, this doll is secretly a gateway to another place that’s filled with traps and puzzles. To get out of here, you must find the Fixer Elixir. Archipelagos A mythical race forgotten by time has created archipelagos (island chains), these hold several mysteries of the past and answers for the future. These precursors who created the islands are known simply as “Ancients”, and they also created a race called the “Visitors” who rebelled against their creators and killed them. However, the blood of these dead Ancients is doing something terrible to the islands which are now filled with misery and suffering. As the player character, it’s your job to explore each archipelago and destroy certain objects responsible for spreading the blood of Ancients through the islands. You have a first-person 3D view. Once you destroy all malevolent objects in an area you must also find the nearby obelisk and destroy it. Chip’s Challenge Originally released for Atari Lynx in 1989, Chip’s Challenge was eventually ported to MS-DOS PCs and even Windows 3.1 PCs as part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack. The story of this game centers on a high-school nerd, Chip McCallahan who wants to get into an exclusive club of teen scientists called the Bit",2023-09-18T20:20:53+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/best-dos-puzzle-games/
15 Best DOS Sports Games That You Must Check,"Whether it’s football, golf, hockey, or motorsports, DOS has a rich and diverse library of sports games for everyone. There are 2D sports games, 3D sports games, and text-based sports games. Some are simulation-oriented, while others don’t take themselves too seriously and just try to have fun. Today, I shall take a look at the 15 best DOS sports games that you must check out. Of course, there’s a lot more than just 15 in the DOS library but I’m only including the most popular and revolutionary titles here. There was plenty of cheap shovelware back then, and trust me- you don’t want to play that stuff. John Madden Football Initially, Trip Hawkins (the designer) approached Joe Montana and Joe Kapp to endorse his football game which would be created in the same vein as Strat-O-Matic. However, Montana already had a deal with Atari, and Kapp was charging too much. So two years go by, and guess who agreed to put his name on the box- John Madden himself. John Madden Football was received favorably by critics who appreciated the combination of simulation elements with arcade-like features. If you wanted a simple practice run, you could hop into Quick Mode. And for those who wished to go all-in on stats and team building, there was the Standard Game mode. Double Dribble Made by Konami and released for arcades in 1986, Double Dribble eventually got a PC port one year later. With a massive side-scrolling court, smooth animations, cinematics, and accurate player models, Double Dribble was considered the most realistic basketball game of its time. When a player performed a slam dunk, you’d get an animated cinematic sequence that was stylish and impactful. 3D CyberPuck The single most obscure sports game on DOS, 3D CyberPuck is what happens when you combine hockey with spaceships. After all, the only thing more exciting than hockey is hockey with rocket boosters and sci-fi gadgets. You get many exciting powerups, such as the Gravity Well which can be dropped in the middle of the play area to attract the ball. You can also deploy a portable wall that bounces the hockey ball once before breaking. Everyone is driving a rocket ship, and you get shields that prevent your opponent from stealing your ball. Sometimes, you can even drop mines that send the ball flying in a random direction with great speed. 4D Sports Boxing Despite the name, this isn’t a 4D game. However, it’s 3D which I feel is more than enough for most people- we aren’t quite ready for the metaphysical plane yet. This is one of the earliest games to feature 3D opponents in the ring, and they are made of polygons. Boxers in this game are loosely based on real-world fighters and have varied stats. Some punch hard, others punch fast. If you play as the champ, you have extremely high attributes in all aspects of boxing. Hardball III The PC version of Hardball III contains more complex game mechanics compared to the SNES and Sega Genesis versions. For starters, logging your seasonal stats is a much more seamless process on a PC because you have a hard disk drive. Consoles had to go through an elaborate password-based process to do the same thing. Upon release in 1992, Hardball III was praised for its wonderful integration with VGA graphics and modern soundcards of the era. Its animations, stat system, and team mechanics were also revolutionary for being hyper-realistic compared to the more arcade-themed baseball games prevalent during the 1990s. NHL ‘94 Back when EA Sports wasn’t universally, NHL ’94 was one of its premier products. It’s one of the earliest multiplatform ice hockey games and is licensed by both the NHL and NHL Player’s Association. Unlike other hockey games of its era, NHL ’94 used an isometric camera angle that offered you a bird’s eye view of all the action. While characters were still represented via 2D sprites, their animations were significantly upgraded. New mechanics like the “one-timer” were added, along with the ability to save records. All of this, combined with the 4 new game modes made NHL ’94 one of the best sports games of all time. R.B.I. Baseball 2 The second game in the R.B.I Baseball series, it’s fully licensed and features all major league teams along with every player from the 1990 roster. If you want, you can even choose to play as one of the 1989 All-Star squads. You can play solo, 1 v 1, or a full season against every team in the division. Action Soccer If you just want to have some good old-fashioned fun without getting realistic, Action Soccer is perfect for you. Its cartoonish theme is further accentuated by the comedic timing and sarcastic commentary of Jonathan Pearce. You can play solo against the computer, or against another person in 2-player mode. The isometric 3D camera is perfect for fast-paced action, and you can choose from a wide range of unique player characters while building your team. Each character has attributes such as speed, skill, strength, etc. The weather changes during the game and adds a new layer o",2023-09-16T10:32:00+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/best-dos-sports-games/
15 Best DOS FPS Games That You Must Play,"DOS gaming from the 1980s and early to mid-1990s is an era often overlooked when people talk about early first-person shooters. Everyone thinks FPS only became a thing after Windows and DirectX went mainstream, but that’s far from the truth. DOS was just as good for high-octane FPS action as it was for puzzle and adventure games. To revisit and celebrate this oft-forgotten era of FPS gaming, here are the 15 best DOS FPS games that you must play. You have the classics like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, these are pure shooters with awesome music and loads of bad guys to kill. However, I’ve also included a few games that mix and match genres to create truly unique experiences you won’t find anywhere else. Doom Doom’s success owes as much to its ingenious art design, as it does to the headbanging heavy metal soundtrack. The game’s levels are designed to be a cross between the sci-fi horror world of Alien, and the hellscape of Evil Dead. You’re armed with a small arsenal of murder paraphernalia, including classics like the chainsaw and double-barrel shotgun. As your nameless space marine claws his way through one demonic level after another, the enemies begin to get progressively stronger. Along the way, you find some amazing weapons like the BFG (take two guesses what that abbreviation means) which can clear out an entire room with one shot. Wolfenstein 3D The predecessor to Doom, Wolfenstein 3D evolved from the game “Castle Wolfenstein”, which was originally released on Apple II. Instead of the stealth mechanics present in the 2D action adventure it’s based on, Wolfenstein 3D embraces action and sci-fi. Most of the nazis in Castle Wolfenstein are regular people, armed with rifles and submachine guns. But you’ll occasionally come across cybernetically enhanced nazis, giant attack dogs, and various other evil contraptions that wouldn’t feel out of place in a James Bond movie. And the game culminates in a fight against Adolf Hitler in a mech suit, under the Reichstag. Needless to say, Wolfenstein 3D has plenty of blood and gore (which feels impactful even to this day). Quake Just as Doom was an evolution of Wolfenstein 3D with faster-paced shooting and more outlandish enemy designs, Quake is an advancement of Doom- with a much larger focus on multiplayer. Featuring music by Nine Inch Nails and eerie-looking levels inspired by medieval gothic art, Quake is darker and grittier than Doom. The game has both single-player and local multiplayer. What really sells the game, however, isn’t its wide and varied selection of weapons (which are amazing) or the unique gothic aesthetic. Instead, it’s the way you can move and how the physics works. Quake lets you rocket jump, bunny hop, and change direction while you’re flying in the air, making it the first-ever “movement shooter”. System Shock System Shock isn’t your traditional FPS. It’s not a game in which you take out hordes of bad guys with your overpowered weaponry while feeling like a badass 1980s action movie hero. Instead, you’re forced to feel like the weak underdog as you cautiously tiptoe around a derelict space station, listening to audio logs and trying to figure out what happened. Apart from space zombies and robots, you’re also being hunted by a rogue AI known as SHODAN who also happens to have a god complex. SHODAN wants you dead and will use the spaceship’s various systems against you. Enemies are few and far between, but the tension is high since you’re often armed with nothing more than a pistol and crowbar. Heretic Imagine Doom, but with roleplaying elements lifted straight out of Dungeons and Dragons. Heretic uses the Doom engine but adds several new features. For starters, you now have an inventory and the ability to use magical artifacts that give your weapons a secondary firing mode with much more powerful attacks. You can also look up and down, and the levels are often designed with an element of verticality to take advantage of this feature. Some of the levels will contain interactive elements, like streams of water that can carry you away. Weapons in Heretic perform similar functions to those of weapons in Doom but also have new and unique abilities. Instead of shotguns and rocket launchers, you’ve got claws, wands, bows, and staffs. Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri It’s like Titanfall, except this game was released in 1996- 18 years before Titanfall, and probably older than half of Titanfall’s player base. As for the story, it’s a weird mishmash of science fiction tropes and cold-war politics. In Terra Nova, a faction of humans escape the solar system to colonize Alpha Centauri, because Earth has been taken over by a totalitarian socialist government. In terms of gameplay, it’s very similar to MechWarrior 2, each motion of your mech suit feels weighted and tactile. You fight other mechs and vehicles in a massive 3D landscape full of divergent terrain features such as hills, lakes, forests, etc. Each mech comes with a wide range of weaponry, ranging fro",2023-09-14T12:28:06+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/best-dos-fps-games/
30 Best DOS Horror Games Of All Time That You Need To Play,"If there’s one game genre that fell off after the early 2000s, it’s horror. We get the occasional Resident Evil and a couple of semi-decent indie horror games on Steam each year. But nothing like the consistent supply of genuinely spooky games that DOS gamers enjoyed some 30 years ago. And it’s a real shame because modern technology allows developers to do things they could only have dreamed of in the DOS era. Thankfully, you can still play old horror games using emulators such as DOSBox. To help you on your horror journey, here are the 30 best DOS horror games of all time. Alone In The Dark The original survivor horror game, this series predates Resident Evil and inspired many of the elements you see in nearly every modern game of the same genre. And while Resident Evil revels in its 1990s B movie majesty, Alone In The Dark takes inspiration from the works of HP Lovecraft. The series contains half a dozen mainline games with a few spinoffs and promotional releases. In the first game, you’re introduced to the series protagonist Edward Camby. A private investigator with a penchant for exploring haunted houses and cursed towns that are full of horrors. The original Alone In The Dark is also considered the first 3D survival horror game, and it was released in 1992- nearly 4 years before Resident Evil on PS1. Transylvania Not only is Transylvania a real place in central Romania, but it also has a Gothic fortress called the Bran Castle. This castle is related to the legend of Dracula and has been the inspiration for dozens of vampire movies based on Bram Stoker’s original novel from 1897. And that’s why Transylvania (the game) is something you should play if you’re a fan of old-school graphic adventures that explore the occult side of things. Vampires, werewolves, witches, demons, goblins- this game has it all. Your goal in the game is to rescue Princess Sabrina who’s trapped in a coffin inside a castle tower. It was originally released for the Apple II in 1982, followed by ports to other platforms like Atari 8-bit and MS-DOS. Ecstatica As we progress through the early 1990s, survival horror as a genre gradually begins to take shape. Evolving into its ultimate form with titles like Resident Evil and Dino Island. However, the foundation was laid by Alone In The Dark and Ecstatica. If you liked the 3 rd -person perspective and fixed camera angles from PS1 Resident Evil games, Ecstatica did it first. Plus, it let you choose between a male and a female character. While Resident Evil has guns and zombies, Ecstatica has martial arts and demons. System Shock This is unlike anything you’ve ever played, or will ever play. System Shock is the original space sci-fi horror game in which you fight a rogue AI called SHODAN who has taken control of a derelict space station. You’re a lone security engineer, on the run from new and devious plots hatched by this AI in its attempt to stop you. As the game progresses, you begin to understand what happened at the station and why everyone is missing. You unravel corporate espionage secrets, ethically questionable conspiracies, and various other secrets on this space station. The gameplay is a mix of action-adventure and roleplaying. Elvira: Mistress Of The Dark An adaptation of the second Elvira movie, this game was released in 1990 and features the original actress Cassandra Peterson as Elvira. It’s a horror movie with some comedic elements, which makes it a very unique experience. Elvira’s uncle has died and she is now the sole inheritor of his castle, which she promptly turns into a tourist attraction. But during the renovation process, she accidentally awakens an evil witch who turns out to be her ancestor. Monsters emerge from a portal and imprison Elvira within her castle, using her as a sacrifice to summon the evil sorceress Emelda. As the player, you must free Elvira and prevent Emelda from taking over the world. Harvester Steve Mason is an 18-year-old who suddenly finds himself in a midwestern town ruled by a cult. This cult calls itself The Order of the Harvest Moon and forces Steve to carry out seemingly harmless tasks that ultimately have violent and gruesome outcomes for everyone involved. As the player, you have no memory of how you got into this town or what these cultists are after. However, you can’t escape either- forced to commit one heinous crime after another to learn more about your past and who you are. Harvester is eerie, with a tense and brooding atmosphere that makes you question your integrity. It’s a genuinely unsettling horror game, with a surrealistic portrayal of violence. Maniac Mansion A graphic adventure made by Lucasfilm Games; Maniac Mansion isn’t so much a horror game as it is an action game with spooky elements. You play teenager Dave Miller, a heroic character who’s on a quest to rescue his girlfriend. She has been kidnapped by an evil scientist who intends to use her for various experiments. But that’s not all, the scientist is being mind-contr",2023-08-31T17:09:12+00:00,Jacob,Gaming Shift,https://gamingshift.com/best-dos-horror-games/
Can PS1 Controllers Work On PS2?,"With PlayStation, Sony introduced a revolutionary way to enjoy games that were now in full 3D and featured huge FMV cutscenes for a more cinematic experience. To navigate through this exciting new world gamers used the brand-new controller that had a D-pad with 4 face buttons (X, square, triangle, circle). It even had triggers for your middle fingers, something that every prior controller had lacked. But can PS1 controllers work on PS2? Yes, they will work on PS2 because both PS1 and PS2 controllers share the same port and basic control layout. Because PS2 uses a PS1 CPU as its I/O chip, it can perfectly read inputs from a PS1 controller and can even read PS1 memory cards . If you connect your PS1 controller to a PS2, make sure you’re not using it for a game that requires the DualShock. If the game doesn’t need analog sticks, you can play it just fine with a PS1 controller. Another thing to remember is that the PS1 controller doesn’t have pressure-sensitive buttons, while the DualShock does. PS1 Controller vs PS2 Controller If you open up both controllers you’ll see that they share much of the same basic circuitry with two exceptions. Firstly, the DualShock has two analog sticks and rumble motors. Secondly, it has pressure-sensitive buttons that are used by a small group of games such as Gran Turismo. What this means is that you can control the throttle and brake in Gran Turismo using just the X and square button rather than the right analog stick. This feature didn’t stick around for too long because it had more downsides than upsides. For example, people often found themselves slowing down in racing games just because they slightly lifted off on the X button. These days, the only pressure-sensitive parts of a controller are the triggers (L2 and R2). PlayStation 1’s controller had none of these fancy features, it didn’t have a rumble motor or analog sticks. Yet, games were designed around these limitations until the upgrade controller with analog sticks arrived in 1997. You don’t have to do anything special to make a PS1 controller work on PS2. Just plug it in like a DualShock and insert your PS1 disc into the tray. PS2 can also read PS1 memory cards (these will only work with PS1 games, not with PS2 games). Is A PS2 Controller Compatible With A PS1? Here’s the fun part- not only does a PS1 controller work flawlessly on PS2, but a PS2 controller will also work flawlessly on PS1. Because the controllers are so similar in how they process and send inputs, you can use them on either console. Just keep in mind the fact that many PS2 games require analog sticks so you can’t play them with a PS1 controller. What Controllers Work On A PS2? In addition to PS1 and DualShock controllers, PS2 can also support a small group of third-party controllers. The Logitech Wireless Action Controller is officially licensed and built quite well. You can also purchase modern 3 rd party controllers for your PS2, such as this one from Blue Lake Performance. Do PS1 Controllers Work On PS3? The DualShock 3 works perfectly for playing PS1 games on PS3, but you can’t use the original PS1 controllers. PS3 has USB ports rather than the old controller ports, which are used primarily for charging the wireless DualShock 3. If you want, you can purchase an adapter that makes PS1/ PS2 controllers work on PS3. Which PS2 Model Plays PS1 Games? All of them, because PS2’s I/O chip is just a PS1 CPU. Normally this works as a controller for the front ports, DVD drive, rear expansion slot, etc. But if a PS1 disc is detected, this I/O chip switches into backward compatibility mode. Did PS1 Have Joysticks? Not originally, but it got upgraded controllers in 1997 called Dual Analog. Eventually, this developed into the DualShock which would be used on PlayStation 2. Because Sony hadn’t quite figured out a durable enough rumble system, they removed rumble from the European and American releases of the Dual Analog controller. Thankfully, this feature was put back into DualShock for PS2. Conclusion I hope this article helped you understand more about the backward compatibility of PS2 with PS1 controllers. You can connect a PS1 controller to a PS2 as long as the game doesn’t require a DualShock. Some games even use the pressure-sensitive buttons of DualShock 2 and won’t work with a regular DualShock. For those who aren’t aware, the DualShock is an improved version of the Dual Analog controller that was originally released in 1997 for PS1. It added rumble, and the DualShock 2 is a DualShock with pressure-sensitive face buttons. Because it uses the same protocol as a PS1 controller, a PS2 controller can be connected to the PS1.

EA FC 26 İnceleme: Bu Sahalar Biraz Fazla Tanıdık…,"Her sene olduğu gibi bu sene de EA FC ile tekrardan buluştuk. Uzun bir süre oynadık ve sizler için detaylarıyla birlikte inceledik. Olumlu, olumsuz tüm yönlerini detaylarıyla birlikte sizlere aktardık. Gelin lafı daha da uzatmadan EA FC 26 incelememize başlayalım. EA FC 26 ne sunuyor? EA FC serisi, her yıl üzerine koyarak kendini devam ettirmeye çalışıyor. Tabii, bu konuda bazı dönemler başarılı olamayabiliyor. Bu yapımla birlikte, oyuna kayda değer bazı yenilikler geldiğini söyleyerek başlayabiliriz. Özellikle oynanış tarafında, oyunculara farklı modlar sunulmaya çalışılmış ve dinamiklerde bazı değişikliklere gidilmiş. Buna ek olarak kariyer kısımlarında da irili ufaklı değişiklikler de meydana gelmiş. Oynanıştaki değişiklikler EA FC 25 ile birlikte oynanış sisteminde bazı değişiklikler yaşanmıştı. Oyun, bizlere iki farklı temel oynanış sistemi sunuyordu. Bunlardan birisi rekabet, diğeri ise gerçekçilik odaklıydı. Her ne kadar çok kapsamlı olmasa da oyunculara bir seçenek sunulması güzel bir detaydı. FC 26 ile birlikte de bu durum daha gelişmiş bir şekilde karşımıza çıkıyor. Artık oyunu oynarken birbirinden farklı iki mod arasında seçim hakkı sunuluyor. Bunlardan biri “Authentic Gameplay” olarak adlandırılan ve oyunculara gerçekçi bir deneyim yaşatmayı hedefleyen oyun modu. Bu modla birlikte oyuncuların hızları, tepkileri, topun hızı ve diğer tüm detaylar gerçek bir futbol maçının hızına ve ağırlığına yakın olacak şekilde ayarlanıyor. Yani oyun daha yavaş fakat gerçekçilik daha yüksek oluyor diyebiliriz. Tabii, bu durum sadece tek kişilik veya arkadaş grupları ile oynanan çoklu oyunlarda geçerli. Ultimate Team tarafında ise tek bir oynanış modu seçeneğimiz bulunuyor. “Competitive Gameplay” olarak adlandırılan bu sistemde, çoğu oyunda bildiğimiz ve kullandığımız sistemin benzeri bulunuyor. Oyuncular ve oyun daha hızlı akıyor, rekabet daha çekişmeli geçiyor. Oyuncular, yaşamak istedikleri oyun deneyimlerine göre bu iki seçenekten birini seçerek ilerleyebiliyor. Oyunun bu konuda oyuncuları düşünmesi ve seçenek sunması artı yazmış diyebiliriz. Temel oynanış mekanikleri ne alemde? EA FC 26’nın bizlere sunduğu oyun modlarının yanı sıra temel mekaniklerde de bazı değişiklikler yaşanmış. Bunların başında kaleciler geliyor diyebilirim. EA FC 25’te uzaktan çok fazla gol atıyordum. Aynı şekilde vurduğum plaselerin çoğu da gol olmayı başarıyordu. FC 26 ile birlikte bu durum biraz değişmiş. Artık kaleciler kolay kolay uzaktan şut yemiyor. Aynı şekilde plaseleriniz de eskisi kadar rahat kaleyi bulmuyor. Bir önceki oyunda “Zaten nerden vurursam vurayım giriyor.” mantığının bu oyunda ortadan kalkması ve artık daha temkinli yaklaşma gereği duymamız oyun deneyimini keyiflendiren bir unsur olmuş. Tabii, online taraftaki oyunlar için bu durum farklı olabilir. Oradaki dinamikler, oyuncu farkları ve kaliteleri arasında büyük farklar olabildiği için gol sayıları da oldukça değişken olabiliyor. Pas ve şut sistemlerinde düzenlemeler yapılmış. EA FC 25 ile birlikte pas oyunu oynamak zor bir hale gelmişti. Gerek isabetlilik gerekse hissiyat açısından zayıf gelmişti. Bu yapımla birlikte bu durum da azalmış diyebilirim. Artık pas oyunu kurmak daha keyifli hale gelmiş. Paslar daha oturaklı ve gerçekçi hissettirmeyi başarıyor. Şut sistemi de aynı şekilde bir önceki yapıma göre üstüne koymuş. Aynı şekilde bir önceki yapımda karşımıza çıkan absürt goller de bu yapımla birlikte rafa kalkmış diyebilirim. Gol atmak artık daha zor ve uzaktan vurduğunuz her şut kaleye girmiyor. EA FC 26, pas ve şut mekaniklerinde oyuncuları tatmin etmeyi başarabilecek düzenlemelere imza atmış. Geçtiğimiz yıllarda eklenen “Zamanlı Bitiricilik” olayı da bu yapımla birlikte kaldırılmış. Geliştiriciler, büyük ihtimalle bu özelliğin çok az bir kesim tarafından kullanıldığını fark etti ve bu özelliği kaldırmış. Bunun yerine daha önceki oyunlarda da bulunan yerden şut mantığını getirmiş. Zamanlı bitiricilik özelliğini neredeyse hiç kullanmayan bir oyuncu olarak, eski sistemi birkaç kez kullandım. Devasa bir fark yaratmıyor fakat sizlere sunduğu çeşitlilik ve zor durumlarda aniden gol çıkartabilmenize imkân vermesi keyif seviyesini artıran unsurlardan olmuş. Oyundaki temel mekaniklerden birisi olan defans sistemi de bu oyunda daha kompleks bir hale gelmiş. Zaten EA FC ismine geçiş yapıldığından bu yana her yeni oyunda defans sistemi daha karmaşık ve zor bir hal alıyordu. Bu oyunda da bu gelenek bozulmamış. Defans yapmak, artık birkaç tuşa basıp bırakmaktan ibaret değil. Adam adama, alan savunması, ileride baskı ve defans çizgisi gibi alanlarda ciddi manada özveri harcamanız gerekiyor. Bu kısımda yapacağınız en ufak hata bile rakibin kaleci ile karşı karşıya kalmasına neden olabiliyor. EA FC serisindeki defans sitemi genel olarak sizi zorluyorsa, bu yapımda da bu durumun devam edeceğini söyleyebilirim. Zorluklar arasındaki dengesizlik Oyunda yer alan zorluklar arasındaki dengeler, geçen sene olduğu gibi pek iyi sağlanamamış. “Profesyonel” zorluktan “Dünya Klası” zorluğ",2025-10-12T10:14:36+00:00,Sezer Yıldırım,SaveButonu,https://www.savebutonu.com/ea-fc-26-inceleme-bu-sahalar-biraz-fazla-tanidik-56498
Cüce Demirci Olduğumuz Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith Türkiye’ye Özel Fiyatla Çıktı,"Compact Core imzalı Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith, Türkiye’ye özel fiyat etiketiyle Steam Erken Erişim’de yerini aldı. Daha önce Barista Simulator ve BBQ Simulator oyunlarını geliştiren Compact Core Games, yayıncılığını GameDev.ist’in üstlendiği M edieval Crafter: Blacksmith ile oyuncuları bir cüce demirci olmaya davet ediyor. 22 Eylül’de Steam’de yerini alacak olan oyunda hem günlük araç gereçler dövüyor hem de kudretli silahları can veriyoruz. Silah atölyemizde dövdüğümüz silah ve zırhları görev temelli bir oynanış döngüsüyle satmak da mümkün. Oyunun en ilginç yanlarından biri ise üretim simülasyonunu, bağımlılık yapıcı bir yönetim döngüsüyle birleştirmesinde yatıyor. Oyunda dövdüğümüz güçlü silahları doğrudan satmak yerine kahramanlarla anlaşıp, onları giydirebiliyoruz. Ekipmanlarımızla bizzat kuşattığımız kahramanları daha sonra görevlere gönderiyor ve bu görevlerden ganimet, yeni silah şemaları ve kıymetli malzemeler elde ediyoruz. Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith bu yönüyle hem zanaat simülasyonu hem de yönetim elementlerini sevenler için ideal. Çıkışına saatler kala 32.000 istek listesine ulaşan yapım, Türkiye’ye özel fiyat etiketiyle çıkış yapacak. Üstelik %20’lik çıkış indirimiyle çok daha cazip bir fiyat etiketine dönüşüyor. Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith 30.000 İstek Listesinde! Erken Erişim etiketiyle çıkan yapım ilerleyen süreçte atölyeyi düzenleme ve genişletme gibi yeni güncellemelerle buluşacak. Otomasyon elementini de oyuna kazandırmak isteyen geliştirici ekip, ham maddeleri toplamak için atölyemizde işçi çalıştırmamızı sağlayarak, farklı formüller ile oynanışı derinleştirmeyi hedefliyor. Birçok Erken Erişim oyununda olduğu gibi Compact Core Games de bu süreçte oyuncuların geri bildirimlerine de ihtiyaç duyacak.

MotoGP 25 İnceleme Dosyası: Erişilebilir Motorculuk,"MotoGP serisinin en yeni üyesi MotoGP 25, devasa yapımlarının birbirlerini gölgede bırakmak için yarıştığı bir haftada çıkmış olabilir. Ancak bazı yönleriyle serinin kıdemlilerinden çok acemilerine hitap ediyor. Buna rağmen dikey öğrenme eğrisiyle oyuncusunu zorlayan MotoGP 25, yeni modları ve Unreal Engine 5 ile yenilenen görselliğiyle serinin hayranlarını da memnun edebilir. MotoGP 25 inceleme dosyamızda serinin yeni üyesinin önceki yıla kıyasla neler sunduğuna, serinin hem severlerine hem de yeni tanışanlarına neler vadettiğine bir bakalım. MotoGP 25 İnceleme – Oyun Modları MotoGP 25’in serinin önceki oyunlarından sonra devrimsel mekanikler getirdiğini söylemek mümkün değil. Her ne kadar önceki oyunlarda piste çıkmamış olsam da Milestone’un seriye vites attırdığını söyleyemem. Fakat yine de Grand Prix yarışlarının arasında nefes alırken oynayabileceğiniz, oldukça keyifli üç farklı mod, MotoGP 25’in serinin hayranlarını da memnun edecek derinliğe götürüyor. Minibikes, Motard ve Flat Track modlarında aslında farklı sürüş disiplinlerinde kendimizi test ediyoruz. Örneğin Minibikes modunda daha küçük yarış motorlarında yarışıyoruz. Manevralara daha sert tepkiler veren bu motorlar, kariyer modunda alıştığımı GP motorlarından sonra çok farklı hissettirdi. F1 24 İnceleme Dosyası: Yılın En Tartışmalı Yarış Oyunu Motard ve Flat Track ise Minibikes’a göre daha zorlayıcı yapıdalar. Örneğin Motard modunda yine farklı motorlarla asfalt zeminde yarışırken, Flat Track’teki ilk yarışımda duvara çarpmış gibi hissettim. Eski Need for Speed oyunlarındaki gibi gaz verip, keserek öne geçtiğiniz bir yapıyı benimseyen Flat Track’te yolda kalmak çok zor. Ama oyun bunun üstesinden gelme konusunda oldukça motive edici. Dolayısıyla MotoGP 25 oyun modlarıyla da benden geçer not aldı. Kariyer Modu Nasıl Olmuş? Oyunun kariyer modu ise MotoGP 24’teki kariyer modunun üzerine küçük fakat etkili bazı değişiklikler getirmiş. Geliştirici Milestone tüm modu elden geçirmek yerine, yarışçılarla birebir kapıştığımız bazı meydan okumalarla kariyer modunu zenginleştirmiş. Hem meydan okumalarda hem de kariyer modunun doğal akışında sıklıkla yaptığım şey ise motoru test etmek oldu. Ancak ekiplerin bir test sınırı var ve test yaparken üreticilerin aldığı notları gözden geçirmek ve parçaların ne kadar yükseltilebileceğine dikkat etmek gerekiyor. Aslında birçok araç simülasyon oyununda gördüğüm ve çok sevdiğim bir karar süreci var. Her şeyi mikro düzeyde geliştirmeye çalışmak ve en küçük ayarlamaların bile pistte etkisini görmek için uğraşmak keyifli. Bir de bunun üzerine oynanış kabiliyetimin vakit geçtikçe artmasıyla MotoGP 25 benim için çok keyifli bir oyuna dönüştü. Fakat öğrenme hiçbir zaman belli bir doğruda gitmez. MotoGP’nin en yeni halkasında da bariyerlere çarpmak mümkün. Oyun her ne kadar tüm yönleriyle çok daha erişilebilir bir hale gelse de karmaşık gaz hareketlerinin üstesinden gelmek hala biraz zorlayıcı. Burada da devreye mühendis bileşeni giriyor. MotoGP 25’te mühendisinizle konuşup zorluk yaşadığınız noktalarda rehberlik ederek gelişmenizi sağlayan ipuçları sağlıyor. Serinin Hayranları Belki De Es Geçmeli… Serinin önceki oyunlarında onlarca saat asfalt ağlatan kıdemlilerin MotoGP 25 hakkında bolca şikayet edeceği noktalar olacak diye düşünüyorum. Ben 30 saati aşkın oynanış süremde ne kadar keyif alsam da, MotoGP 24’ün başarılı adımlarının kaybolan izlerini birçok kez hissettim. Fren ve yol tutuş mekaniklerindeki pişmemişlik ve keskin oynanış eğrisi sanal motorculuk kariyerimdeki en problemli noktalar oldu. Küçük bir dönüşte yaptığım hata bile oyunun acımasız fizik mekanikleri tarafından kurban edilmeme yol açtı. Bunun başta benden kaynaklı olduğunu düşünsem de küçük bir araştırmadan sonra geliştirici Milestone’un yapay zekanın farklı bir fizik modelinde oynadığını öğrendim. Fakat ilk 5-6 saatteki bu adaletsizlik, oyunu öğrenmeye çalışma isteğim ve en basit haliyle motor sürmenin verdiği keyifle yerini kabullenmeye bıraktı. 10.saatten sonra oyunun farklı modlarında keyif alıyor, bir sonraki virajda rakiplerimi nasıl yeneceğimi planlayıp gaz ve fren oyunları yapıyordum. Serinin kıdemli oyuncuları arasındaki büyük bir kitle MotoGP 25’in seleflerine göre farklı yönlerde geriye gittiğini söylemiş. Oyunun özellikle Steam üzerinde aldığı incelemeler, serinin Unreal Engine 5’e geçmesine rağmen teknik, oynanış ve de görsel açıdan vites düşürdüğünü bile belirtmiş. Buradaki en sık okuduğum eleştirilerden biri oyunun halihazırda bir Arcade modu olmasına rağmen Pro modunu da kolaylaştırmaları hakkında. Geliştirici Milestone, oyuncu tabiriyle “çok kasmadan” oynamak isteyenler için bir mod sunarken, profesyonel modda gerçekçi fizik mekaniklerinin işlediği bir deneyim vadediyor. Ancak o deneyimi bile basitleştirmek kıdemlilerin MotoGP 24’ü konsollarından ya da bilgisayarlarından kaldırmadan önce bir daha düşünmelerini sağlayabilir. Seriyle Tanışanlar İçin İdeal Ancak önceki MotoGP oyunlarını hiç oynamamış biri olarak, beni mekanikleri alıştırma süre",2025-05-10T10:26:02+00:00,Kerem Doğan Karakoç,SaveButonu,https://www.savebutonu.com/motogp-25-inceleme-dosyasi-56435
inZOI Ön İnceleme: Sims’in Tahtına Aday mı?,"Hayallerimizdeki hayatları yaşadığımız, en azından karakterlerimize yaşatmaya çalıştığımız yaşam simülasyonlarının şimdilik son ve en iddialı görünen temsilcisi inZOI oyunculara erken erişim sürecinde neler vadediyor gelin ön inceleme ile bir bakış atalım. Yıllardır kayda değer en önemli temsilcisinin The Sims serisi olduğu yaşam simülasyonu türü haliyle pek çok oyuncunun kafasında bu seri ile özdeş. Ancak inZOI Studio tarafından geliştirilen ve yayıncı koltuğunda Krafton’un oturduğu inZOI arkasına büyük bir beklenti rüzgarı alarak karşımıza çıkmaya hazırlanıyor. Oyunu erken erişim sürecinde deneyimleme fırsatı bulmuş ve kendini bildi bileli yaşam simülasyonları (tamam itiraf ediyorum, çoğunlukla The Sims serisi) ile haşır neşir ben sevgili editörünüze de inZOI ön inceleme yazısı kaleme almak düştü. Karakter Yaratma Ekranı ile Başlayalım Unreal Engine 5’in gücünü arkasına alan inZOI etkileyici ve detay seviyesi ile şaşırtan gerçekçi grafikler ile karşımıza çıkıyor. Haliyle bu detaycılık seviyesi ve gerçekçilik karakterlerimizde de kendini gösteriyor. ZOI’lerimizi yaratırken yüzündeki küçücük bir benden tırnaklarının uzunluğuna, göz bebeklerinin şeklinden (evet şeklinden) makyajının en ine ayrıntısına kadar pek çok farklı detaya müdahale edebiliyoruz. Bunun yanında eksikler yok mu, elbette var. Karakter yaratma ekranında en çok dikkatimi çeken eksik kıyafet seçeneklerinin azlığı oldu ancak bunu hem erken erişime, hem de kıyafetler üzerinde dilediğimiz gibi oynamalar yapabilme özgürlüğümüze bağlıyorum. Oyunun hazır sunduğu kıyafetler pek çeşitli olmasa da biraz vakit ayırarak ZOI’nizi bir k-pop yıldızı veya moda ikonu gibi giydirmeniz mümkün. Seçtiğiniz kıyafetin yakasından koluna kadar her şeyi değiştirerek bambaşka bir parça ortaya çıkartabilirsiniz. Kısacası zevkinize uygun bir kıyafet bulamadıysanız ona en yakın giysiyi bulduktan sonra üzerinde kendi değişikliklerinizi yaparak karakterinize “haute couture” bir tasarım giydirebilirsiniz. Karakter yaratma ekranının sunduğu şeyler karakterimizin dış görünüşü ile de sınırlı değil. ZOI’lerimizin kişiliklerine, hayat amaçlarına ve tutkularına da yine bu ekrandan seçiyoruz. Oyun bize toplamda 18 kişilik tipi ve özelliği arasında seçim yapma imkanı sunuyor ve bu kişilik özellikleri karakterimizin davranışlarının bir nevi temelini oluşturuyor. Örneğin girimci karakterler stresle öteki kişilik tiplerindeki karakterlerden daha çok katlanabiliyorlar. Bu karakter özellikleri oyun boyunca ZOI’ler arasındaki iletişimi de etkiliyor. Örnek vermek gerekirse tam da bekleneceği üzere otoriter ZOI’ler ve özgür ruhlu karakterler pek de anlaşamıyorlar. Karakteri Yarattık, Sıra Başımızı Sokacak Bir Yer Bulmakta InZOI karakter yaratma ekranındaki çeşitliliği inşa konusunda da sürdürüyor. Yıllarca The Sims’in her bir oyunu başında ayrı ayrı dirsek çürütmüş biri olarak başlangıçta inZOI’nin inşa sistemine alışmak ne yalan söyleyeyim beni biraz zorladı ancak bir kez alıştıktan sonra da devamı çok kolay geldi. Oyun erken erişimde karakterimizi sokaklarına dilediğimizce atabileceğimiz ve birbirinden farklı temalara sahip 3 şehir ile karşılıyor. Benim tercihim şehir yaşantısından yana oldu ancak siz dilerseniz karakterinizi sakin bir sahil kasabasında keyif çatmaya da yollayabilirsiniz. İnşa kısmına geri dönecek olursak inZOI eşyalar konusunda da özelleştirme noktasının üzerine epeyce eğilmemizi sağlıyor. Pek çok farklı eşya arasından dilediğinizi seçtikten sonra bunları dilediğiniz gibi kişiselleştirmeniz mümkün. Örneğin bir yatakta karar kıldıktan sonra malzeme türünden rengine, yatak örtüsünün kumaşından bu kumaşın dokumasına kadar neredeyse her detaya kendi dokunuşunuzu katabiliyorsunuz. Ha derseniz ki “benim o kadar vaktim de sabrım da yok” öyleyse sizi oyunun sunduğu hazır evlere doğru alalım. Şahsen ben öyle yaptım. InZOI’nin en dikkat çekici yanlarından bir tanesi de oyuna istediğiniz nesneyi ekleyebiliyor oluşunuz. 3D printer sayesinde yüklediğiniz bir fotoğrafı oyun içerisine 3 boyutlu model olarak aktarıp kullanabiliyorsunuz. Buna farklı kıyafet ve aksesuarlardan tutun eş eşyalarına veya süslemelere kadar pek çok şey dahil. InZOI’yi diğer rakiplerinin önüne geçiren en büyük özelliklerden birisi bana kalırsa bu. Ayrıca şimdiden muzip oyuncuların yaratacakları “enteresan” tasarımları da merak etmiyor değilim. Bunun yanında geliştiricilerin de sık sık üzerinde durdukları konulardan biri hareketler ve mimiklerin de videodan oyuna aktarılabileceği ancak dürüst olmak gerekirse bunu denemedim ve nasıl bir performans gösterdiği konusunda fikrim yok. Peki ZOI’lerimizin Hayatları Nasıl Geçiyor? Karakteri yarattık, evimizi dayadık döşedik. Sıra geldi kendimizi sokaklara vurmaya. Geliştiriciler her ne kadar The Sims rakibi olmadıklarını söylemiş olsalar da oyuncular olarak pek çoğumuz oyunu pek çok ve haklı sebeple The Sims serisi ile kıyaslıyoruz. InZOI yıllardır alıştığımız The Sims serisine göre çok daha gerçekçi bir ortam sunuyor. Bu gerçekçilik yalnızca karakter görünüşleri veya gr",2025-03-20T12:43:46+00:00,Beril Özge Danacı,SaveButonu,https://www.savebutonu.com/inzoi-on-inceleme-simsin-tahtina-aday-mi-56411

Bungie Veteran Joseph Cross Appears to No Longer Be Marathon’s Franchise Art Director [UPDATE],"Bungie veteran Joseph Cross appears to have stepped away as Marathon’s Franchise Art Director, based on recent LinkedIn and social media changes. Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has slowly been finding its footing again after a rocky year . The studio released a new 22-minute ViDoc giving us a much cleaner, more polished look at the game, along with new dev updates on what’s changed since the early Closed Alpha test. Bungie is now targeting a March 2026 release window for the game. Following its gameplay reveal earlier this year, the game faced heavy criticism from parts of the community, with fans asking for features like proximity chat, solo play, and improved visuals . Bungie has confirmed that proximity chat and solo play option are coming to Marathon, and we already saw a much better look at the exterior environments in the new ViDoc. Image: Bungie Related: Court Dismisses Ex-Marathon Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit Against Bungie and Sony But Marathon hasn’t had an easy road since its gameplay reveal earlier this year. The biggest controversy came from the art theft situation , where 1:1 design assets were found in the alpha build of the game that had been used without permission from independent artist Antireal (4nt1r34l). Bungie publicly acknowledged and apologized for the issue at the time, and Antireal later said the dispute has been resolved to her satisfaction . Now, there is a new development that has caught the attention of fans. Joseph Cross Appears to No Longer Be Marathon’s Franchise Art Director It appears that longtime Bungie veteran Joseph Cross may no longer be serving as Marathon’s Franchise Art Director, or may have left Bungie entirely. This information comes from changes spotted on Cross’ LinkedIn profile, where his role as Senior Art Director at Bungie is listed as ending (or ended) sometime in 2025. Cross had held that position since 2018, which is around when Marathon entered development. His long tenure made him one of the key creative figures tied to the project. In addition to LinkedIn, Cross’ public social media presence has also changed. Earlier this year, his X profile bio listed him as “Franchise Art Director, Marathon @ Bungie .” That wording has since been updated to a broader description that reads “Art Director & Artist – Marathon. Dune. Destiny…” with no direct mention of Bungie or a specific leadership role. Update, December 18, 2:03 PM PT: After our report, Kotaku’s Ethan Gach reached out to Joseph Cross. Cross confirmed he left Bungie by choice. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” Cross said. Image: X | LinkedIn via The Game Post Related: Destiny 2 Leak Reveals Marathon Crossover Armor Sets and Cosmetics This does not fully confirm that Joseph Cross has left Bungie. It is also possible that he has simply moved into a different position within the studio or stepped away from the Marathon project while remaining at Bungie in another role. The Game Post has reached out to both Joseph Cross and Bungie for comment. We will update this story if we receive a response. As for Marathon itself, Bungie recently announced several changes aimed at addressing player feedback, including improvements to visual clarity, emphasis on “dark sci-fi world” building, and new social features like proximity chat.

"Sony vs Tencent ‘Horizon Clone’ Lawsuit Over Light of Motiram Ends in Settlement, Game Delisted From Storefronts","Sony and Tencent have reached a confidential settlement to end the Light of Motiram “Horizon clone” lawsuit, and it looks like the game has now been delisted from major PC storefronts. Sony and Tencent’s legal battle over Light of Motiram , a game Sony previously described as a Horizon lookalike, appears to have reached its end. The lawsuit, filed by Sony Interactive Entertainment in late July 2025 in a California federal court, accused Tencent and its subsidiaries of copying major elements from the Horizon series, including its world, characters, and overall presentation. Over the last few months, the case turned into a back-and-forth about what counts as inspiration versus copying. Sony pushed hard for an order to stop the game from moving forward, while Tencent ’s side argued Sony was trying to lock up common ideas and style choices in the genre. Image: Tencent | Polaris Quest Related: Tencent pushes to throw out Sony’s Light of Motiram lawsuit, saying it’s “based on future conduct that has not, and may never occur,” and arguing that “fame does not create a trademark” as Sony “fails to identify Aloy’s appearance as a trademark outside the game” Just two weeks ago , things still looked like they were headed toward a bigger showdown in early 2026. The two sides even agreed, on paper, that Tencent would pause promotion and public tests while the legal schedule played out, with the idea that major issues could be heard together in January. Then came a surprising new development. In a new court filing submitted earlier today and obtained by The Game Post , it appears the lawsuit is over. Sony and Tencent End the Light of Motiram Lawsuit According to the filing, Sony and Tencent jointly asked the court to dismiss the case under a rule that allows both sides to end a lawsuit by agreement . The document makes it clear that this decision follows a confidential settlement between all parties involved. The lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice. That means the case is closed for good , and the same claims cannot be brought back to court later. The filing also confirms that all pending motions have been withdrawn and that each side will cover its own legal costs. Here is the full statement from the court document: “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and the confidential settlement of all parties, Plaintiff Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC and Defendants Tencent America LLC, Proxima Beta U.S. LLC, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Proxima Beta PTE Ltd., and Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Company Ltd., by and through their undersigned counsel of record, hereby stipulate as follows: “All pending motions are withdrawn and this action is hereby dismissed with prejudice. All parties shall bear their own fees and costs.” Image: Tencent Related: After Sony’s ‘Horizon’ Knock-Off Lawsuit Against Tencent, Light of Motiram Dev Scrubs Store Page, Changing Game Description, Images, and Key Art There is no mention of how much money, if any, changed hands as part of the settlement. The terms are fully confidential, and this was the only court filing submitted today. For now, there is no public record that reveals the actual value of the deal or any specific conditions tied to it. Light of Motiram Gets Delisted from Storefronts Adding another layer to the story, Light of Motiram was also delisted from major storefronts earlier today , just before the court filing appeared. The game’s product pages on both Steam and the Epic Games Store were removed, making it unavailable to view or wishlist on either platform. At the time of writing, the Epic Games Store link leads to a 404 Page Not Found screen. And on Steam , the game’s product page no longer loads a normal product page and instead drops you back onto Steam’s main storefront. As things stand, the lawsuit is finished, the game is no longer listed on major stores, and many questions remain unanswered. Whether Light of Motiram will return in a different form, under a new name, or not at all is something only Tencent can clarify in the future.

Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!",2025-12-18T05:22:17+00:00,Zuhaad Ali,The Game Post,https://thegamepost.com/sony-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-settlement-delisted/
New PlayStation 6 Handheld Leak Claims Sony Is Prepping “Canis” Through PS5 Power Saver Mode,"A new leak claims Sony ’s PS5 Power Saver push is seemingly the groundwork for the PS6 handheld codenamed “Canis,” with dev docs hinting at fewer CPU threads and new Low Power Modes. Rumors around the PlayStation 6 have been coming in fast lately, and the handheld side of it is starting to sound less like fan fiction and more like a plan. The current leak pile includes a PS6 home console reportedly codenamed Orion, plus a native handheld codenamed Canis, both tied to AMD Zen 6 CPUs and RDNA 5 graphics. On the handheld hardware side, the same reports have suggested a portable system built around Zen 6c CPU cores , RDNA 5 compute units , 16GB of LPDDR5X memory . There are also repeated claims that Canis would support PS5 and PS4 backward compatibility , with a USB-C setup that could potentially allow TV play. Image: Sony | Rockstar Games via The Game Post Related: PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR 2 Reportedly Doesn’t Have Frame Generation in the Plans The most recent rumor before today was claimed Sony is strongly encouraging studios to support PS5’s “Low Power” mode , and not in the lazy “just cap it at 30 FPS” way. The claim was that Sony wants games to hold 60 FPS by dropping resolution and trimming CPU usage , basically to make sure PS5 titles behave on a lower-power profile later. Now, well-known hardware leaker, Moore’s Law is Dead, is back with some new leaked details around the PlayStation 6 handheld. PS5 Power Saver Mode Might Be Sony’s Handheld Compatibility Plan In the new Broken Silicon episode , MLID says a source told him Sony patched all PS5 dev SDKs back to version 1.0 to add Power Saver support, despite being “currently on 12.0.” He also claims Sony did not do this kind of backporting work even for PS5 Pro support, which is why he argues Power Saver support is the bigger priority internally. He then points to a CPU optimization document that allegedly mentions more Low Power Modes coming “eventually” and “directly suggests” games should be runnable on only eight CPU threads . The line he quotes from the document is: “new operation modes may be supported in the future and applications may run in environments with different available CPU configurations.” MLID also says his source wanted one point emphasized: Sony has “directly told them” this work will support new CPU architectures , and devs “cannot assume” the same thread counts forever. Image: Sony Related: PlayStation Leak Hints at “Cross-Buy” Feature, Possibly Between PS5, PC, and Rumored PS6 Handheld Here’s the full on-screen quote shown in the video from the leaker’s source: “Sony just patched all of their SDKs for PS5 game development back to 1.0 to support Power Saver Mode (they’re currently on 12.0). To be clear – they didn’t even do this for PS5 Pro support – if you had an old launch game on SDK 1.0 or 2.0, they’d tell you to ‘update to the latest SDK’ if you wanted to start working on adding direct PS5 Pro modes to your game. That means Power Saver Mode support is more important to them than Pro support! “Additionally, one doc talking about CPU optimizations mentions that there are new Low Power Modes coming eventually , and directly suggests that your games should be runnable on only 8-Threads…it even at one point states: ‘new operation modes may be supported in the future and applications may run in environments with different available CPU configurations’…Sony is definitely preparing a Canis Handheld!” If any of this is real, the implication is that Sony may be trying to make “PS5 Low Power” a common compatibility target, so a handheld can run more PS5 games without each title needing a special, painful rewrite.

PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR 2 Reportedly Doesn’t Have Frame Generation in the Plans,"A new rumor about PS5 Pro’s PSSR 2 says Sony isn’t planning frame generation. If you’ve been keeping an eye on PS5 Pro news, PSSR 2 has quickly become the big “next year” rumor . The recent leaks claim Sony is working on a major upgrade to its PSSR upscaling for 2026 , with a new approach that’s supposed to look cleaner while using less memory and less GPU time. The chatter also says it would need game updates, since it may rely on a new API instead of being a simple switch. Now, a new round of details has surfaced, and it focuses on one feature some people assumed was coming along for the ride: frame generation. Image: Sony Related: “It’s not some 0.5 upgrade, it’s huge”: New leak claims PS5 Pro will get “PSSR 2” in 2026 using “Multi-Frame Super Resolution 2” to cut memory use and GPU time PS5 Pro PSSR 2 rumor says no frame gen The new comments come from hardware leaker and insider, Moore’s Law Is Dead in a new Broken Silicon episode , where he says he’s relaying what he’s hearing from developer sources and backend documentation. When the discussion turned to frame generation for the next version of PSSR, he shared a message he says came from a source familiar with Sony’s tooling. Here’s what he said: “A source I was talking about this [PSSR 2], then I just asked, ‘is there any reference to frame gen?'” Apparently, the source replied, “not a single one in the next PSSR. I haven’t heard a single developer ask Sony to add Frame Gen to PSSR.” He then follows with:”“not only is Sony not working on it, but they know that developers hate it, hate it, hate it.” The claim is not that frame generation is impossible on PlayStation, but that Sony’s next PSSR 2 upgrade is being treated as an upscaling and image-quality project, not a frame-gen initiative. One possible reason is that frame generation can come with tradeoffs like artifacts and inconsistent motion. Image: Sony Related: New PlayStation 6 handheld leak claims Sony “needs” devs to support PS5 Low Power mode and “maintain 60 FPS by lowering resolutions” to get games ready for launch As for the bigger PSSR 2 package, the earlier rumor set is still the same. The leaks have described PSSR 2 as “MFSR2” internally, with goals like needing fewer inputs, reducing memory use, cutting GPU processing time, and improving image quality versus current PSSR. There’s also talk of Sony shipping better debugging tools for teams, including a replay tool to help track down PSSR artifacting issues. As always, take all of this with a grain of salt. None of it is confirmed by Sony, and “developer sources” can mean anything from early notes to outdated plans. On the PS6 handheld side, the latest rumor says Sony’s new PS5 Power Saver push could be more than just saving electricity . In this same episode, Moore’s Law Is Dead claims a source told him Sony has patched every PS5 dev SDK back to version 1.0 so studios can add Power Saver support even on older builds, and that Sony is treating this as a bigger internal priority than PS5 Pro-specific work. He also points to a CPU optimization doc that allegedly hints at more Low Power modes coming, and says games should be able to run on only 8 CPU threads. The idea is that if PS5 games can reliably run in a lower-power profile, it becomes much easier to carry them over to the rumored PS6 handheld without every game needing a painful custom rewrite.

Would you rather Sony focus on making PSSR 2 cleaner and cheaper to run, or do you want frame generation in the mix too?",2025-12-16T19:16:25+00:00,Abdullah Jawad,The Game Post,https://thegamepost.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-frame-generation-isnt-plan/

Court Dismisses Ex-Marathon Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit Against Bungie and Sony,"A Delaware judge has tossed Christopher Barrett’s $200M lawsuit against Bungie and Sony, not on the facts, but because the case was filed in the wrong court. Former Marathon director Christopher Barrett filed his lawsuit against Bungie and Sony on December 12, 2024 , claiming the companies wrongfully fired him and did it, in his view, to dodge tens of millions in payments tied to Bungie’s post-acquisition agreements. The lawsuit came after public reporting about why Bungie let him go . Bloomberg reported that an internal investigation found Barrett acted inappropriately toward multiple women at the studio, and that at least eight female employees raised complaints. The report described things like flirty messages, comments about looks, and “truth-or-dare” conversations. Image: Bungie Related: Sony Details ‘Disturbing’ Text Messages in Response to Ex-Bungie Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit From Barrett’s side, the story has been that Bungie and Sony used him as a “scapegoat” and fired him to avoid paying him money tied to Bungie’s Sony acquisition and related deals. From Sony and Bungie’s side, the argument has been that he was terminated “for cause” after multiple reports from employees, and they’ve said they’ll fight the claims. Now, there’s a big development. In a new court order filed on December 10, 2025, and obtained by The Game Post, Delaware’s Court of Chancery has dismissed the case . Delaware court dismisses Chris Barrett lawsuit against Bungie and Sony The biggest thing to understand is that the judge did not decide who’s telling the truth about what happened at Bungie. Instead, the Court of Chancery said it cannot hear this dispute at all , because what’s left in the lawsuit is essentially about money damages . The order explains that the Court of Chancery is a limited court. It mainly handles certain kinds of disputes, like cases where someone is asking for special “equitable” fixes, not just money. “The case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,” the order reads. “The Court of Chancery is a court of limited jurisdiction. It possesses subject matter jurisdiction only when ‘(1) one or more of the plaintiff’s claims for relief is equitable in character, (2) the plaintiff requests relief that is equitable in nature, or (3) subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by statute.'” Image: Bungie Related: Bungie Takes Down Marathon ViDoc Featuring Former Director Chris Barrett Following Reports Of Inappropriate Behaviour The order also shows how this got to this point. On October 13, 2025 , the court issued an order asking why the case should not be thrown out for lack of jurisdiction. “On October 13, 2025, the court issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Dkt. 62. Only the defendants argued that subject matter jurisdiction exists. Dkt. 65. The Employee was happy to transfer the case to Superior Court. “Under Court of Chancery Rule, this court must dismiss a lawsuit when it lacks subject matter jurisdiction. This court has an independent obligation to evaluate whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.” The court walks through a few different attempts to keep the case in Chancery, and rejects them one by one. A lot of it comes down to the same idea that even if the dispute is tied to stock awards, merger-related agreements, or a payment plan, the remaining fight still looks like a fight over money payments , which is usually a “regular court” issue, not a Chancery issue. There’s also a moment where Sony and Bungie argued that questions about interest could matter later, and the judge basically says that is not enough to decide jurisdiction. “The defendants also contend that any claim to an award of interest would require interpreting the Merger Agreement. The question of interest will not come up until the end of the case, and then only if the Employee prevails. It is also unlikely that there will be a significant dispute over the interest rate. The interest rate tail should not wag the jurisdictional dog.” Image: Bungie Related: Sony and Bungie Call Former Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit ‘Baseless Attempt To Obtain Hundreds Of Millions’ And when it comes to Barrett’s FMLA-related requests, the order notes that he asked for reinstatement, but the judge says it’s very unlikely the court would actually do that, and that money damages would probably cover it anyway. “Here, reinstatement may be theoretically available, but it is highly unlikely that the court would grant it. A damages remedy is highly likely to be adequate.” What happens next This dismissal does not automatically mean the dispute is over. The order lays out that Barrett can choose to move the case to Delaware Superior Court under a state transfer rule. “The plaintiff can make a timely election to have the matter transferred to the Delaware Superior Court.” For now, we’ll have to wait and see how this progresses further. This is also not the only lawsuit Sony i",2025-12-14T18:51:31+00:00,Zuhaad Ali,The Game Post,https://thegamepost.com/court-dismisses-marathon-chris-barrett-200m-lawsuit-bungie-sony/
Destiny 2 Equilibrium Dungeon Guide – Complete Walkthrough,"Here’s our comprehensive guide on how to complete every encounter in the new Equilibrium dungeon in Destiny 2 . Equilibrium is Destiny 2’s newest 3-player dungeon, launched in the second week of Renegades , and it drops some exciting new rewards , including the Heirloom Exotic plus a full set of new dungeon weapons and armor. Story-wise, Equilibrium puts you alongside Aunor Mahal as you track down the acolytes of Dredgen Bael . The opening encounter takes place on Venus, but the following encounters are actually on the ship. If you’re trying to get in right away, make sure you actually have access: you need to purchase the Renegades expansion. Image: Bungie via The Game Post Related: Destiny 2 Equilibrium Loot Table: Dungeon Weapons and Armor In this guide, we’ll walk you through the whole dungeon, each and every mechanic you can find, and how to solve all the puzzles. We’ll keep the walkthrough simple: what to do, what usually causes wipes, and quick role callouts. Opening Encounter When you load into Equilibrium, you’ll spawn in the Temple Grounds with a simple first objective: clear the area . Right away, a wave of Cabal enemies will drop in. Wipe them out before you push forward. Nothing here is meant to be a hard fight, but it’s easy to get slowed down. There’s a yellow bar Cabal called “Imperium Generalis,” that spawns here. There will be a bunch of Cabal drop pods that will drop on each side, which will instant-kill you. So, stay clear of each side. Image: Bungie Once the area is clear, move forward until you see a waterfall ahead. Jump down and drop all the way to the bottom , then head forward into a tunnel . Inside the tunnel, you’ll run into a few Cabal War Beasts . Clear them quickly, then keep moving, since this section is mostly just a short run to the first real arena. Keep moving forward through the tunnel and follow the path until you come out the other side. As soon as you exit, the first encounter area will be directly in front of you . Image: Bungie First Encounter: Harvester This first encounter is Harvester . You start by interacting with the ship in the middle, then you’re basically juggling two things at once: keeping the arena under control while your team builds up Gathering Shadows so you can use Shadow Novice to break enemy shields and push the encounter forward. After the encounter kicks off, focus on clearing enemies , because the arena can get messy fast. During this, you’ll see red Nameless Apprentices show up. These are the ones that look like they’re about to explode, and they’re tied to the red doors around the arena. Image: Bungie Related: Destiny 2 Equilibrium The Way Between Quest: All Relic Locations, Puzzle Solutions, and How To Focus Loot When an Apprentice is close to detonating, you need to activate the arrays (Satellites) next to the matching red door . Bait the Nameless Apprentice to the array you, and activate it as the enemy explodes. It will destroy the array . Doing that opens the red barrier door and keeps your run moving. There are six Apprentices total , and once they’re dealt with, no more should spawn. Again, there will be a bunch of Cabal drop pods that can take you out instantly. So, make sure you keep moving. Image: Bungie Now use the Sparrows inside the side rooms, and that’s your key to building Gathering Shadows quickly. Hop on a Sparrow and run the short courses around the arena, grabbing the Taken wells as you go. Keep collecting until your Gathering Shadows meter is filled. Once it’s full, it’ll turn into Shadow Novice with a 45 second timer. Once you’re full, hit the Renegade ability button to swap into Shadow power . Go back in the middle area and use it to destroy the immune shields on enemies, then take them down. You can also refresh your Shadow Novice by picking it up from dead Gladiators , so don’t ignore those drops if your meter runs out mid-rotation. Image: Bungie To finish Harvester, you need to kill all remaining adds and also take down the Behemoth Walkers that show up. After collecting the loot, head to the ship in the middle and interact to board. It will take you to the main ship. Order of Operations Interact with the ship in the middle to begin Harvester. Clear immediate ads and keep moving. Watch for Cabal drop pods , since they can instang-kill you. Watch out for red Nameless Apprentice , move toward the array (satellite) next to red barrier door. Bait the Nameless Apprentice onto the array, then activate the array as it explodes . The explosion destroys the array and opens the red barrier door . Head into the opened side rooms and use the Sparrows inside to start building Gathering Shadows . Ride the course and collect Taken wells until Gathering Shadows is full. When full, it converts into Shadow Novice with a 45-second timer . Hit the Renegade ability button to activate the Shadow power using your Shadow Novice window.

"Destiny 2 Equilibrium The Way Between Quest: All Relic Locations, Puzzle Solutions, and How To Focus Loot","Here’s our full step-by-step guide for Destiny 2 ’s Equilibrium dungeon quest “The Way Between,” including all four relic locations, puzzle solutions, how loot focusing works, and how to unlock the Heirloom catalyst. Equilibrium is Destiny 2’s newest dungeon, and if you’re here, you’ve probably already completed it once. It’s a three-player activity that leans hard into the Shadow mechanics you learn early on, which builds on in the later encounters. If you’re still working on the clears themselves, start with our complete Equilibrium dungeon walkthrough guide first , then come back here once you’re ready to chase the deeper rewards. Equilibrium also has a full dungeon loot pool, including the Exotic Heirloom , plus a full set of dungeon weapons and armor. If you want the full list of drops, roll potential, and which items exist at all, check our complete Equilibrium dungeon loot table . Image: Bungie via Breshi123 Related: Destiny 2 Equilibrium Loot Table: Dungeon Weapons and Armor Just like a lot of previous dungeons, Equilibrium also has its own questline: “The Way Between. ” It’s a 10-step quest that requires you to complete the dungeon multiple times, with hidden routes, secret fights, and four relics to find. In this guide, we’re going to walk you through how to complete The Way Between from start to finish, where every relic is, how each puzzle works, and what you need to do at the end to unlock loot focusing and get started on the Heirloom catalyst . How to complete The Way Between quest in the Equilibrium dungeon The Way Between is built around repeat clears. You do a normal clear, then new secret puzzles appear in the dungeon. You solve a puzzle, collect a relic, and then the quest requires you to complete the dungeon again. Each time you progress, the dungeon opens up more steps until you’ve collected all four relics and unlocked the final secret boss. The biggest thing to understand is that this quest is not meant to be finished in one casual run. It will take multiple clears to wrap it up, because the quest adds new objectives after you complete earlier ones. That said, there is a way to speed it up if you run with someone who is already ahead on the quest. We’ll share how this works below. Image: Bungie via Breshi123 What you unlock from this quest Completing The Way Between is worth it for two reasons. First, it unlocks the dungeon’s reward loop, including the ability to focus for specific Equilibrium loot instead of just hoping the right item shows up. Second, it’s tied to getting the Heirloom catalyst , which is something you’d really want to get. A huge part of the quest is also finding four hidden relics inside the dungeon. Each relic is tied to a puzzle path, and the final relic leads to a secret boss fight that acts like the quest’s real finish line. Now let’s get into it step-by-step. (thanks, Skarrow9 ) Image: Bungie via The Game Post The Way Between quest walkthrough Step 1 Visit Aunor Mahal. Pick up The Way Between from Aunor at the Tharsis Outpost before you jump into the dungeon. This is your “quest is active” step, and you want it done before you spend time on clears. Step 2 Complete the Equilibrium dungeon normally. Your first step is simply getting a full clear. No tricks, no puzzles, just finish the dungeon so the quest begins to open up the extra paths. After you defeat the final boss, Dredgen Sere, you’ll get a new item called Integrated Relic. This is the first of the four relics you need to find and place them at a specific place in the dungeon. Image: Bungie Step 3 After the first encounter, enter the Praxic Temple and place the relic. Once you beat the first encounter called Harvester, do not immediately push forward like a normal run and board the Harvester ship. Turn back and head into the Praxic temple area behind you, which opens up for the quest. Inside, you’ll place the relic into one of the slots. This will kick off the rest of the quest. You’ll get some dialogue from Aunor Mahal. Image: Bungie Image: Bungie Step 4 (Relic 1 and Puzzle 1) After placing the first relic, leave the temple, go left into the same zone that connects to the sparrow/pike section from earlier during the encounter. You’re looking for a Taken orb. Break that orb using the Praxic Blade, and it will create a Taken well . Get your whole team inside that puddle to start the secret encounter . Once the secret encounter starts, you’ll be fighting Taken and dealing with Eyes of Acolytes. Killing the eyes drops, Shadow energy wells, and standing in them is how you power up your Shadow energy, working your way toward Shadow Master. Image: Bungie There are also immune shielded Captains that show up during this, and the clean way through is to become Shadow Master and then use your special ability , like the Shadow attack, to break their shields so your team can kill them. Tip: If you have a friend who is ahead on the quest or has already finished it, run with them.

Destiny 2 Loot Tables: All Raids And Dungeons Gear,"Discover comprehensive loot tables for all Destiny 2 raids and dungeons, detailing the exotic and legendary rewards players can earn from these challenging endgame activities. Destiny 2 offers an expansive universe filled with numerous activities for players to explore, but none are as challenging or rewarding as raids and dungeons. Raids in Destiny 2 are six-player cooperative missions that often span multiple encounters, each with unique mechanics and bosses. Dungeons, on the other hand, are typically three-player activities that offer a similar level of complexity and reward structure but on a smaller scale. They blend the difficulty of raids with the accessibility of smaller fireteams, providing a perfect middle ground for players who might not have a full team of six.

Ky'veza will only be obtainable until the launch of Midnight Pre-Patch, January 20th, instead of ""the launch of the next season of Delves"", as stated previously.

This achievement awards the player with the Delver's Mana-Skimmer Schematic: Hyperdrive transformation for your Delver's Mana-Skimmer and has been available since the beginning of Season 3. If you are looking to complete ?? Ky'veza and earn this transformation for your mount, you only have about a month left from the publication of this article, as the Midnight Pre-Patch arrives on January 20th (US) / January 21st (EU).

This means that if you want to obtain the title, you should do so before Pre-Patch arrives. Earning Hyperdrive Customization After Midnight While the achievement won't ever be obtainable again, you will likely still be able to obtain Delver's Mana-Skimmer Schematic: Hyperdrive in the future.

Blizzard Needs to Make Diablo 4's Sanctification System Permanent,"Season 11 is well underway, the holidays are here, leaderboards are coming soon, and there's a new expansion on the way. There's a lot to look forward to going into the new year for Diablo, but Sanctification is one system that hasn't been announced as a core feature going into the base game. If Blizzard wants to give players a richer itemization, build diversity, and endgame longevity, Sancification needs to stay going forward. Diablo 4's Itemization Problems Gear in Diablo 4 comes in three core flavors: Legendaries, Uniques, and Mythics, but realistically, there isn't much in terms of choice for these items, and the core changes to Tempering and Masterworking in Season have only made them less interesting by removing variance and individuality from gear. For any given build, there is a set of enabling uniques that must be used, full stop. As an example, Death Trap Rogues not equipping Scoundrel's Leathers or Eyes in the Dark would not just make the build worse, it would make the build entirely unplayable. These item slots are essentially ""locked"" for each build, with no alternatives available. Similarly, Mythics share the same fate. Items such as Harlequin Crest, Shroud of False Death, and Ring of Starless Skies have become staples of many builds, or in the case of Starless Skies, sometimes even build-enabling through the resource cost reduction. With Uniques and Mythics, it is normal, almost expected, that 4-5 item slots are pre-determined, locked in powers with no diversion. In terms of variance and inter-build diversity, gear progression, power-scaling, and even endgame grinds, that only leaves Legendaries to do the heavy lifting of the entire gear system. And yet, Legendaries suffer much the same fate as Uniques and Mythics, with aspects like Vehement Brawler's Aspect being required parts of builds as well. From top to bottom, Diablo 4's gearing is dictated and pre-determined not by gear, but by the guaranteed effects on them. Sanctification as a Solution to Diablo 4's Gearing This is where Sanctification comes in. With the numerous outcomes available to the system, double aspect items, sanctified affixes and more, item slots are no longer ""finished"" the moment a required piece of the puzzle drops. Gear with Sanctification is more individual, enables gear decisions if certain aspects or mythic powers are added, and gives players something to gamble and work towards. Chasing that perfect piece of gear is one of the great joys of any ARPG, and the base game without Sanctification doesn't have the itemization depth to enable that chase. For the good of the game, Sanctification has to become a core system starting with Season 12.",2025-12-24T13:01:22+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379768/blizzard-needs-to-make-diablo-4s-sanctification-system-permanent

Warlocks Can Now Unlock the Power of Fel Magic in Mists of Pandaria Classic,"Warlocks, masters of the Fel, have long wanted a way to make their fire spells match the energies they harness and wield in combat. In the original release of Mists of Pandaria, a new questline was introduced to reward players with this unique customization. Isle of Thunder Zone Guide Much like the Benediction questline for Priests, or the Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers challenges for Hunters back in Classic, the The Codex of Xerrath questline for Warlocks in Mists of Pandaria (now returning in Mists of Pandaria Classic) will challenge you to make full use of the Warlock class' kit and utility, and require quite a bit of skill (and a bit of luck) to succeed. Starting the quest You'll begin your quest by looting a Sealed Tome of the Lost Legion from rare mobs in the Isle of Thunder. The drop rate for the tome is relatively low, but with some persistence, you can score one eventually. If you're not inclined to grind, you may also find it at your local Auction House. Keep in mind that the tome is only lootable by Warlocks, and any Warlock that tags an Isle of Thunder rare can potentially loot it, but only one tome drops per rare, and only one Warlock will get it from that kill (the loot is pre-assigned, so it doesn't matter how fast you loot the corpse; only the assigned Warlock will be able to see it or loot it). Look for Jubeka's Mark at the entrance of the Black Temple to start the final Scenario. Once you obtain it, you should be able to follow the questline, which starts with An Unusual Tome. As you follow the chain (no spoilers here, sorry!), you will learn about the mysterious Council of the Black Harvest, and ultimately travel to the Black Temple, Illidan's former seat of power. The Solo Challenge The last quest, Infiltrating the Black Temple leads you to one of WoW's most memorable solo challenges: Kanrethad Ebonlocke. This encounter is more about proper execution than it is about raw item level, as Kanrethad has a lot of abilities that need to be reacted to, and proper use of your skills is required to succeed. ""Say hello to my little friend!"" While obviously a higher item level (closer to 522+ at least) will make the fight easier, it is definitely possible to complete it with an item level as low as 489 and even lower. It is advised that if you're trying this at a lower item level, to bring plenty of combat consumables (flasks, food, potions) and a few Purification Potions to deal with Kanrethad's Curse of Ultimate Doom if it comes to that (this is the fight's ""enrage"" timer). Power! Unlimited (Fel) Power As a reward for your efforts, once you defeat and banish the infamous Leader of the Black Harvest, you'll be able to learn The Codex of Xerrath, which has various cosmetic effects that are better experienced than spoiled. While the changes are more obvious to Destruction players (as they have more Fire spells), every specialization will see changes in its spells. Should you wish to go back to a life of non-green fire (and really, who would want that?), you'll find Jubeka Shadowbreaker in Shadowmoon Valley, where she can rid you of the Fel awesomeness burden for the low sum of . Should you wish to become awesome tainted by Fel magic again, simply interact with the banished Kanrethad. Did you defeat Kanrethad in the original Mists of Pandaria release or in MoP Classic? How many attempts did it take?

Corruption of the Aspects - Twelve Days of Mounts: Day 4,"Welcome to day four of our special Twelve Days of Mounts series, 2025 edition! With the year coming to a close, we are doing a series of highlights on remarkable or easy-to-collect mounts added in 2025. Today's highlight is the Corruption of the Aspects! The War Within Mount Guide Corruption of the Aspects Corruption of the Aspects is an easy mount to collect from Revisited Horrific Visions. It is sold by Torie, the Revisited Horrific Visions quartermaster in Dornogal, for 40,000 Displaced Corrupted Mementos. Note that you must complete the achievement We Have the Memories before being able to purchase it. Horrific Visions Revisited Horrific Visions returned in Patch 11.1.5, with a new set of cosmetics to unlock. To enter these new visions, you must head to Dornogal, next to the Coreway: Horrific Visions Hub If you're soloing this, you'll need to progress through Visions to unlock its tech tree. If you haven't, you can learn about that process here. After unlocking the whole tech tree, the only thing left is to farm Corrupted Mementos to purchase your mount, which will take you a few extra Horrific Visions runs, depending on how many Masks you're running. More Masks will award you with more Mementos, but will make the runs more deadly and dangerous. However, with Season 3 gearing, it shouldn't be too bad. Visions offer a plethora of pets, toys, and mounts besides the Corruption of the Aspects.

"Blizzard, Where Is The Festive Housing Decor?","The Holidays are fast approaching, and decorations have gone up all around the world. For player housing, however, the Winter Veil Tree is missing. With the Winter Veil Tree datamined weeks ago, it stood to reason that holiday decor would become available before Christmas, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. Christmas is just a few days away, Winter Veil is well underway in-game, but it remains unknown how to obtain the special tree. Festive holiday decor would be a great addition to player housing. It could be used to celebrate everything from birthdays with special cakes to Christmas or even more regional holidays, such as the 4th of July, which could have outdoor fireworks. At the end of the day, if festive decorations are going to work, Blizzard needs to give players their decorations in advance, rather than after the fact, when all the festivities are already over. Where is the Winter Veil Tree? The most likely source for the tree is as a present under Greatfather Winter's tree, which can be opened starting December 25th. This does however make for a bit of an awkward timing, as players would be receiving holiday decorations after the holidays. Some more outlandish ideas for the tree's drop source include it being part of the endeavour system or being added to a vendor via a hotfix, both of which seem unlikely given that Winter Veil Tree is named after Winter Veil. Getting Creative for Christmas Players instead have resorted to making their own trees, such as Reddit User Lexiconn, who spent a whole afternoon setting up a massive tree in their main room. Lexiconn made sure to include all the details in their tree, including presents! Sadly for players that aren't willing to spend hours making a tree from scratch, Blizzard has provided very little in the way of information regarding the Winter Veil Tree decor item.",2025-12-23T04:58:21+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379765/blizzard-where-is-the-festive-housing-decor

Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine - Twelve Days of Mounts: Day 3,"Welcome to day three of our special Twelve Days of Mounts series, 2025 edition! With the year coming to a close, we are doing a series of highlights on remarkable or easy-to-collect mounts added in 2025. Today's highlight is the Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine! The War Within Mount Guide Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine Salvaged Goblin Gazillionaire's Flying Machine is a rare drop from the Gallagio Garbage rare spawn in Undermine. This rare has a chance to spawn during S.C.R.A.P. jobs in Undermine, namely when the job hits 500/500 tracking. Scrap Jobs Scrap digging is an activity unlocked in Undermine, starting with Renown 3 with the Cartels of Undermine. Note that you don't need to unlock it to obtain this mount, as it is a drop for the rare. You need to unlock it to help summon the rare, however. Once you go through the tutorial quest, you can start doing S.C.R.A.P. Jobs in Undermine. To locate them, look at the Undermine world map for trash icons. Once you find one, head to the area and speak with the NPC in the area, Carlo Greasegrind, to start a job. Once a job starts, you have 2 minutes to dig through as much trash as possible! Digging trash will give you a new currency, Empty Kaja'Cola Can. As you dig, you will face enemies that will distract you and require killing, hazards that require dodging or kicking, and more. While farming for this mount, you'll likely earn many Empty Kaja'Cola Can from doing the scrap digs. These can be traded with Angelo Rustbin at the Undermine Sanitation building in Hovel Hill for other items like toys or pets, or even for a bag that has a chance of containing a mount. You can learn more in our Scrap Digging guide. Day 1: Personalized Goblin S.C.R.A.P.per Day 2: Darkfuse Spy-Eye Day 3: Gazillionaires Flying Machine Day 4: Corruption of the Aspects Day 5: ? Day 6: ?

Even More Buffs Coming to Arms Warrior on China's Titan Reforged Server,"Blizzard and NetEase have announced additional changes to Arms Warrior on China's Titan Reforged server. These changes are intended to improve the attack speed scaling and overall damage output for Arms Warriors. Restoration Druid Healing Buffs Massive Buffs to Arms Warrior After the weekly maintenance on December 25, we will be making the following adjustments to Arms Warriors on the Titan Reforged server: Time: Warrior Changes Arms: Wrecking Crew Damage bonus increased to 4/8/12/16/20% (up from 3/6/9/12/15%) Blood Frenzy Attack speed bonus increased to 10/20% (up from 5/10%) Bladestorm Now deals 115% weapon damage (down from 125%) Can now hit up to 6 targets Deals 30% additional damage to the nearest target. This results in a total of 149.5% weapon damage to the nearest target Developer’s Notes: The goal of these changes is to improve attack speed scaling and overall damage output for Arms Warriors, while also giving Bladestorm greater flexibility so it can effectively serve both single-target and multi-target scenarios. To achieve this, we increased Bladestorm’s target cap while slightly reducing its base damage coefficient, and introduced a key new mechanic: Bladestorm now deals additional damage to the nearest target. With these adjustments, Bladestorm should feel more impactful in both single-target and AoE combat, without becoming overly dominant in multi-target situations. It also introduces an interesting positional decision for the Warriors—standing closer to a priority target to deal increased damage.

The Pre-Nerf or Post-Nerf Debate - How Difficult Should It Be to Raid in Classic?,"Blizzard recently announced that they would be looking into whether or not they will release raids post-Tier 4 in their pre-nerf state. At the beginning of PTR testing, Blizzard announced that their initial plan was for all raids to go live post-nerf, sparking a large debate among the community about whether or not this was the right decision. Post-Nerf Difficutly Under Discussion Some players want to see the raids in their original iteration, while others welcome raids being more forgiving and easier overall. In this article, we'll not only go over the pros and cons of both pre- and post-nerf raids in TBC Classic, but also look into the future of Classic WoW's raiding scene. The Difference Between Pre-Nerf and Post-Nerf The Pre-Nerf state of a raid refers to the original difficulty of the raid. While Post-Nerf refers to the state of the raid after receiving changes that reduced its overall difficulty. One example players have seen on the PTR with Tier 4 raids includes Nightbane from Karazhan, dealing significantly less melee damage to the tank, while his intermission phase also drastically reduces the health of his Restless Skeleton adds and damage from his Searing Cinders debuff. Nerfs to Tier 4 and 5 TBC Raids Other changes to encounters include Gruul's Shatter ability doing significantly less damage should players fail the mechanic, or Magtheridon's infamous Manticron Cubes not applying the debuff that prevents players from interacting with the cube again. Across the board, nearly all bosses also receive health and damage reductions, making all these encounters significantly easier to overcome. Players testing on the PTR have been able to overcome many of these encounters, even with several members of the raid dead, missing healers, or accidental pulls when everyone in the raid was not ready. Magheridon and the ""Pug Breaking"" Manticron Cubes Common sentiment among players is that Tier 4 raids are already relatively easy, even in their pre-nerf state. However, going into Tier 5 raiding with Tempest Keep and Serpentshrine Cavern, a Tier where raid difficulty exponentially ramps up, especially with encounters like Lady Vashj, this begs the question: ""Should TBC Anniversary move forward with Post-Nerf raids, or look to revert their decision?"" The Pros and Cons of Post-Nerf Raids Benefits of Post-Nerf Raids There are several factors that should be considered when discussing PvE content difficulty in Classic WoW. In regards to the Anniversary servers, the biggest factor to consider is that these servers may be on an accelerated release cadence, meaning that players won't have as much time as they did back in 2006 or 2021 to complete the raids. In a post-Nerf state, raids would be easier, and players would, theoretically, be able to defeat more bosses and earn more loot in a shorter timeframe. Another aspect to consider is what Blizzard wants from these servers. Are these Anniversary servers meant to be a trip back to 2006, for players to experience the content as it was back then? Or is this just more of a ""let's go back and relive some memories with our friends"" situation, where Blizzard simply wants people to log in and have fun, engaging in ""soda and pretzel"" content? In regards to the original Classic progression servers, which are now on Mists of Pandaria, the player population has changed dramatically since Classic launch in 2019. However, there is a notable pattern of player drop-off when more difficult content is released. Via Ironforge.pro, we can see a drop off during Phase 2 of TBC Classic with the release of Tempest Keep and Serpentshrine Cavern, and an even bigger drop off during progression of Phase 2 of Wrath of the Lich King Classic, with the Ulduar raid. The boxed sections highlight player dropoff during Phase 2 of TBC (left) and Phase 2 of WoTLK (right) Should Blizzard want to keep a stable playerbase throughout all of TBC Anniversary, they might think that keeping the raids at a relatively easy state, to encourage more PUG (pick-up-group) raids to exist. Maybe with easier raids, we can see more Trade-Chat PUG groups successfully clearing the raid, eliminating the requirement of needing a locked-in guild raid night for players who may not have a consistent gaming schedule. Negatives of Pre-Nerf Raids On the other hand, there are also several factors to consider about The Burning Crusades Raids at their original difficulty. One question a player should ask themselves is: ""Are these raids really that hard?"" Looking at Tier 4 raids, should it really be that hard to organize players to be able to click the cubes correctly on Magtheridon? Is it really too difficult for players to be able to spread out properly on Gruul to prevent dying to his Stoned and Shatter mechanics? Many challenges back in the original TBC came from the lack of resources we have now. Getting 25 players on Ventrilo (the original Discord) to communicate during an encounter wasn't as easy as it is now.

New House Levels and Rewards Datamined - Increased Decor Budgets and Medium-Size Exteriors,"With Housing being all the craze on live servers right now, it seems that Blizzard isn't quite done with its features for Midnight. We've datamined brand-new Housing levels, with rewards that expand decor budgets and introduce new medium-size house exteriors! New House Level Rewards Level: NEW 7 Name: Room and Decor Placement Budget Bonuses Description: Gain an additional 10 Room Placement Budget and 500 Decor Placement Budget at this level. Level: NEW 8 Name: Medium-Size House Exteriors Description: You may now use medium-size house exteriors for your house. Level: NEW 9 Name: Room and Decor Placement Budget Bonuses Description: Gain an additional 10 Room Placement Budget and 500 Decor Placement Budget at this level. What does this mean? First, it means that Blizzard is still actively tweaking Housing for its actual launch with Midnight. These new rewards mean expanded possibilities for interiors while hinting at changes coming for exteriors, as we hadn't heard of medium-size house exteriors until now. This change might mean new exterior-exclusive decor or options to make decor larger when used in exteriors, meaning you wouldn't need to use all your budget in rocks when building a cave, for instance. However, this is pure speculation.",2025-12-21T06:10:54+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379677/new-house-levels-and-rewards-datamined-increased-decor-budgets-and-medium-size

Platinum Challenge Mode Season 2 Rewards - Mists of Pandaria Classic,"If you found that Challenge Modes weren't quite challenging enough when MoP Classic launched, you might enjoy the updates that came with Phase 3. While there was no actual increase in difficulty, there are now rewards for completing the Challenge Modes in even faster times than Gold. Challenge Mode Rewards Guide Platinum Achievements & Toys Before you say ""an achievement isn't really a reward"", let's just clarify that the achievements come with a toy. If you complete the Temple of the Jade Serpent Challenge Mode dungeon in Platinum time, you will earn the Temple of the Jade Serpent: Platinum achievement, which also comes with the Platinum Boots of Expeditious Retreat toy. Dungeon Achievement Toy Temple of the Jade Serpent: Platinum Platinum Boots of Expeditious Retreat Stormstout Brewery: Platinum Platinum ""Little Ale"" Gate of the Setting Sun: Platinum Platinum Rod of Ambershaping Shado-Pan Monastery: Platinum Platinum Potion of Invisibility Siege of Niuzao Temple: Platinum Platinum Amber Mogu'shan Palace: Platinum Platinum Battle Horn Scholomance: Platinum Platinum Vial of Polyformic Acid Scarlet Halls: Platinum Platinum Battle Banner Scarlet Monastery: Platinum Platinum Sacrificial Dagger Each dungeon rewards its own unique toy, and these toys can only be used inside Challenge Mode dungeons. Most of these toys are versions of commonly used items in Challenge Modes, such as the rocket boots linked above, or the Platinum Potion of Invisibility. Platinum Coins: Mounts, Pets, Toys, & Transmog In addition to an achievement, completing a Challenge Mode dungeon in Platinum time will earn you 3 Platinum Coins. Important to note, you earn coins every time you complete a dungeon in Platinum time, not just the first time. Item Type Price Eye of the Legion Pet 5 Platinum Coins Instant Statue Pedestal Toy 5 Platinum Coins Demon Hunter's Aspect Toy 5 Platinum Coins Swift Yak Pelt Toy 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Ashen Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Crimson Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Violet Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Reins of the Emerald Pandaren Phoenix Mount 0 Platinum Coins Magic Rooster Egg Mount 0 Platinum Coins Wooly White Rhino Mount 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of Brilliance Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of the Void Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Tabard of Fury Tabard 0 Platinum Coins Recolored Challenge Mode Pieces Transmog 5 Platinum Coins Per Piece 0 Platinum Coins Full Set These coins can then be used to buy mounts, tabards, toys, a pet, and recolored versions of the original Gold Challenge Mode sets. The mounts consist of two previously TCG-exclusive mounts, the Magic Rooster Egg and Wooly White Rhino, as well as all of the Silver Challenge Mode Phoenix mounts. The tabards, toys, and pets are also all previously TCG-exclusive items. Jaelof Ironhart To purchase all items you will need 465 coins (only counting 3 Phoenix mounts, since you will have earned one of them from the Silver achievement, and only one recolored transmog set), which means you would need to complete 155 Challenge Mode dungeons in Platinum time. Viktor Felhallow Alliance NPC on the top, Horde NPC on the bottom. The vendors are located in the faction Shrines, and they are Jaelof Ironhart for Alliance players, and Viktor Felhallow for the Horde. They are on the upper levels of the Shrines. Season 2 Rewards In addition to these Platinum awards, there will be rewards for players who complete all Challenge Mode dungeons in an ""exceptionally fast time"". While similar to arena titles, for example, this will not be a percentage of players, but rather a set time for each dungeon. The times have not yet been announced, but the reward will be the Mistborne achievement, which comes with the title, and the Reins of the Black Kor'kron Proto-drake mount. Please note, in the database the achievement currently lists the Reins of the Celestial Riding Serpent as the mount reward, but in a recent news post it was announced that it has been replaced by the Reins of the Black Kor'kron Proto-drake. The mount is a previously unavailable recolor of the Reins of Galakras. Do these updates and new rewards make you more interested in Challenge Mode dungeons?

The Story of Vereesa Windrunner - Midnight Character Spotlight,"Vereesa Windrunner finally returns to the story in the lead-up to Midnight -- but why? Here, we recap her storied history and speculate on what role the lesser known Windrunner might play in the upcoming expansion. Early Life Despite her role of lesser prominence compared to her sisters, Vereesa was one of Warcraft's earliest major characters, and the original Windrunner to appear by name in the franchise's first novel Day of the Dragon. Before she became the ranger we know today, however, Vereesa was merely the youngest of three sisters in the Windrunner family. In contrast to her headstrong older sisters, Vereesa was known as the peacekeeper of the family, soothing arguments not only between Sylvanas, Alleria, and their youngest brother Lirath, but those between Alleria and their mother, the Ranger-General of Quel'thalas Lireesa, as well. In time, Vereesa would follow in the footsteps of her sisters to become a member of the Farstriders, close to the onset of the Second War. Windrunner Spire in Midnight. Eventually, the arguments between Alleria and their mother boiled over when Alleria chose to leave behind Quel'thalas and abdicate her inheritance as Ranger-General to Sylvanas. Not long after, during the early days of the Second War, the first tragedy would strike the Windrunner family when news reached the siblings that their parents had been killed in an ambush by orcs and trolls. While Alleria turned to bloodlust towards the Horde and Sylvanas took up the mantle of Ranger-General, Vereesa was tasked with watching over Lirath, and began to train him to defend himself in secret. When the proper war reached Quel'thalas, Vereesa was among its defenders, rallying with her sisters and the newly formed Alliance of Lordaeron to fend off the Orcish Horde. Vereesa and Sylvanas returned home, however, to find yet more tragedy -- Lirath, dead at the hands of the orcs. When Sylvanas learned that it was Vereesa's training that had given Lirath the confidence to engage in battle, a rift formed between the two sisters. Vereesa would continue to serve the Farstriders, but far away from Sylvanas and her duties in Quel'thalas. In time, the Orcish Horde was defeated, and their remnants fled back through the Dark Portal to find other worlds to conquer. Unwilling to let the orcs go unpunished, Alleria volunteered as one of the leaders of the expedition to follow through the portal, and was forced to leave her son Arator behind in Vereesa's care. Along with the responsibility to raise Arator, Vereesa also recieved a ruby necklace from Alleria; one of a trio, with the other two held by Alleria and Sylvanas. While Alleria would eventually be lost behind the closed Dark Portal and was considered missing, the remaining two sisters held onto the necklaces to represent their bond despite the rifts of space and tragedy alike that had formed between them. Rhonin: Day of the Dragon In the wake of the Second War, Vereesa continued her work as a Farstrider, and desired to hunt down the remaining orcs not locked away in internment camps. Instead, Vereesa was instead assigned as escort to a fledgling mage named Rhonin. Despite her initial distaste for the human, Vereesa grew fond of Rhonin in the wake of a sudden attack by the Dragonmaw orcs and their red dragon mounts, and aided him on his mission to Khaz Modan. While she initially thought she had been assigned on a rather routine observation mission with Rhonin, she would later learn that Rhonin had been tasked by the red dragon Korialstrasz to aid him in freeing the Dragon Queen Alexstrasza and her clutch of red dragons from captivity under the Dragonmaw orcs. On their journey, they join forces with the Wildhammer dwarf Falstad, and were nearly killed by a dragon ambush... before being saved by Deathwing. The black dragon Aspect was not interested in their salvation, unfortunately, and used the opportunity to kidnap Rhonin to prevent him from freeing Alexstrasza. He had plans for the eggs being coveted by the Dragonmaw, and had granted them the means of subjugating Alexstrasza in the first place through use of the Demon Soul, a relic created by Deathwing with the combined power of the other Dragon Aspects. Now, he wished to claim the eggs from the Dragonmaw by force, sparing neither orc nor dragon as he attacked their citadel of Grim Batol. Vereesa and Falstad would later find Rhonin and free him, using the mage's newfound knowledge of the situation to sneak into Grim Batol as the battle with Deathwing waged. Inside, Alexstrasza managed to break free of her chains, rallying the other Aspects to her side and engaging in battle with Deathwing. While their initial attacks were of little effect, Rhonin was able to turn the tide when he used one of Deathwing's own scales to destroy the Demon Soul, returning the power held within to the Aspects and allowing them to chase their former brother off. As reward for their actions, Rhonin and Vereesa were held as friends of high regard to the Dra",2025-12-20T10:51:01+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379122/the-story-of-vereesa-windrunner-midnight-character-spotlight
Farm the Highmountain Paragon Decor in Legion Remix Before it Gets Harder,"Players have discovered an interior decor banner that only comes from Highmountain paragon reputation caches.

For more information about Housing Decor available from Legion or exclusive Legion Remix decor, check out our dedicated guides covering all you need to know. Broken Isles Decor Farming Decor Farming in Legion Remix Farming Legion Reputations in Remix Farming reputation, and thus the paragon caches associated with the Highmountain faction, is much easier with Legion Remix than it would be on the live version of the game.

Using these lets you farm reputation up very quickly.

Best Infinite Power Farms in Legion Remix - Empower Your Timerunner,"With Legion Remix wrapping up after the holidays, let's take a look at some of the best ways to give your timerunner that extra oomph before the timeways collapse. Sentinax Farms Similar to Bronze Farms, Sentinax continues to reign supreme for raw Infinite Power grinds. Its main benefit being a farm that anyone can participate regardless of gear level. You can check our highlight in this standalone article, but the idea is to concentrate one group (ideally more) under the Sentinax and spam all its portals. You should use the group finder to find others interested in this farm, as there are usually a couple happening at all times. Note that, while rewarding, it can be a very boring farm. However, a good farm if you want to catch up on your favorite show or want to watch a new movie. Daily Raid Runs The og Infinite Power farm. While not a ""farm"" in the strict sense, it is still worthwhile to do. Farming raids daily has been a staple of Legion Remix, and it still rewards a plethora of Infinite Power every day, both from raw drops and from gathering 100s of Fragmented Memento of Epoch Challenges. While you can run each Legion raid once a day in each difficulty, for Infinite Power purposes, most players will stick with doing only Heroic and Mythic or only Mythic, as the gains reduce significantly on lower difficulties. Once again, Group Finder is your friend. There are hundreds of players running Legion raids daily, so even if you don't have the best geared character, you might be able to sneak into a run for Mythic raids. Mythic+ If you have a group of 3 to 5, Mythic+ might be the best way to farm for you. The idea here is to run lower keys that any of you can solo quickly and split-run them to complete it even faster. For instance, if you can solo +40, maybe try +30s for speed. The goal is to accumulate as many Fragmented Memento of Epoch Challenges as fast as you can from these keys. Remember to drop your key after each dungeon to keep the speedrun train going. The best keys for this method are keys like Eye of Azshara or Arcway that allow players to do bosses in any order, while keys like Darkheart Thicket or Neltharion's Lair don't really benefit from bringing more players along due to their linear design.",2025-12-19T21:00:08+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379725/best-infinite-power-farms-in-legion-remix-empower-your-timerunner

Majority of Addon Changes Finalized for Midnight Pre-Patch - Whitelisted Spells Detailed,"Following up on the intent to loosen API restrictions shared earlier this week, Blizzard has released a list of whitelisted spells and API changes for the Midnight pre-patch, noting that the majority of future addon changes will be going into Patch 12.0.1 instead. These newly whitelisted spells are broken into two categories, with some being flagged to show just their cooldowns and others having all of their data visible. While all players can benefit from more easily customizing their Dragonriding ability's shared cooldowns, the change to Maelstrom Weapon and Void Metamorphosis information fills a critical informational hole for those specialization. These changes allow addons to track Maelstrom charges, a crucial aspect to playing Enhancement Shaman that isn't well supported by native tools. The other critical piece of information in this release is that the majority of future addon changes beyond those outlined below will be going into Patch 12.0.1, which launches a few weeks after the Pre-Patch. This means that players may need to find some creative solutions for issues not yet addressed as they re-customize their user interface, though the pre-patch is generally the best time for this transition, as players are also adjusting to other class, spec, and game-wide changes. Blizzard again! This week the first PTR build (PTR 1) for Midnight went up. As mentioned before, PTR is now 12.0.0 and all remaining Beta builds are 12.0.1. Below are the changes that are in PTR 1 that were not in Beta 5. It's important to note that ALL changes in PTR builds will also be in Beta, so expect to see these changes in Beta 6 as well when that goes up in January. After this build the majority of our addon changes will be going into 12.0.1 instead of 12.0.0 (we are very close to RC for 12.0.0) but there will be a few things that do go into 12.0.0 as well (mostly very high priority things). New Changes in PTR 1 (will also be in Beta 6) Whitelisting Select Spells The following spells have been flagged as having non-secret cooldowns: 425782 - Second Wind 372608 - Surge Forward 372610 - Skyward Ascent 403092 - Aerial Halt 361584 - Whirling Surge 418592 - Lightning Rush 460002 - Switch Flight Style 61304 - GCD Dummy Spell The following spells have been flagged as having non-secret aura data: 377234 - Thrill of the Skies 388367 - Ohn'ahra's Gusts 418590 - Static Charge 369968 - Skyriding Racing 344179 - Maelstrom Weapon 1217607 - Void Metamorphosis 1225789 - Void Metamorphosis (resource aura) 1227702 - Collapsing Star Combat Res Cooldowns All combat res spells now have non-secret cooldowns and charge counts. Reload UI & Secrets We have fixed an issue where secret values were made non-secret following a reload ui. Removing Old Duration APIs We have removed the follow APIs (addons should use the new Duration Object type instead from now on): C_ActionBar.GetActionCooldownRemaining, C_ActionBar.GetActionCooldownRemainingPercent C_Spell.GetSpellCooldownRemaining, C_Spell.GetSpellCooldownRemainingPercent C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDurationRemaining, C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDurationRemainingPercent Duration Object Utilities Added 2 new APIs to Duration Bbjects: EvaluateRemainingDuration(curve, modifier), EvaluateElapsedDuration(curve, modifier) Generic Boolean To Color APIs Added 2 new APIs (C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorFromBoolean and C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorValueFromBoolean) that can be used to convert a secret boolean to a color.",2025-12-19T17:05:50+00:00,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379738/majority-of-addon-changes-finalized-for-midnight-pre-patch-whitelisted-spells

New Achievements Unlock Mounted Lumber Gathering on Midnight Beta,"As we continue to explore the Midnight beta, we've discovered some new Achievements that could make Lumber Gathering a whole lot easier. According to these new achievements, once a player gathers 250 Lumber from a specific continent, they will unlock the ability to Harvest Lumber while mounted in those Zones! Make Gold With Lumber Gathering Currently, in the Beta, these Achievements do not appear to be rewarded retroactively. This means that players will need to harvest 250 Lumber from each continent after Midnight releases, in order to unlock Mounted Harvesting in those Zones. What do you think of Mounted Lumber Harvesting coming to Midnight? Do you think these Achievements should apply retroactively?

Keen ears might recognize it as a variant of Xal'atath's theme from The War Within, continuing into Midnight with her role as the primary antagonist.
