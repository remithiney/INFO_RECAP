2025-12-16T19:41:00,"How Total War: Warhammer 40K's Factions Will Be ""Totally Different"" From Past Games","Total War: Warhammer 40,000's four asymmetrical factions will vary wildly from one another, as developer Creative Assembly has now outlined how some of the game's factions will play and be ""totally different"" from factions seen before in the Total War franchise. After being announced during The Game Awards , more details about developer Creative Assembly's next game have been revealed via a new developer roundtable. The four factions players will have to choose from include Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, and Aeldari. Mann said the universe has a lot of opportunities for asymmetry between the factions, and Creative Assembly knew that it could only pick a limited number of playable factions in order to give each one the amount of effort to make them feel special. In terms of how they play, each faction will field troops, gather resources, and engage in battle in different ways. Of the four factions, Astra Milatrum is said to be the most ""traditional"" Total War faction, with mass ranks of infantry and support from artillery and vehicles. Like in other Total War games, Astra Militarum players will need to gather resources, build infrastructure, and recruit more troops in order to succeed. In true Astra Militarum fashion, solving problems will often mean throwing more masses of bodies at it.

2025-12-16T17:00:00,Onana at Striker Somehow Worked in EA FC 26 FUT Champs,"In EA FC 26 , most players have long agreed that PlayStyles are the single most important metric when it comes to a player’s performance. Today, a video from FC 26 creator “ BaldMun7 ” underscores just how true that idea really is. In a whacky experiment, the creator gave Onana the Finesse+ PlayStyle to check his goal-scoring effectiveness. In case you’re unfamiliar, Andre Onana is a goalkeeper, and he has a miserable finishing stat of 12 and a 3-star weak foot. He is a goalkeeper after all. However, equipping him with the Finesse+ PlayStyle suddenly transforms him from a great goalkeeper into prime Messi. The creator behind this video was able to dribble past defenders and score jaw-dropping finishes both from inside and outside the box. You can check out the video and the community outrage yourself on Reddit : Onana at Striker. This game is so bad i can’t think of one thing that’s actually right in it. by u/plesteeni in EASportsFC PlayStyles Above All Else This whole Onana debacle is not just an amusing oddity; it’s evidence of PlayStyle ruling as king over stats. Fans over at Reddit reacting to the clip point to the flawed logic of the Finesse+ ability itself. EA describes the PlayStyle as granting “Faster finesse shots with max curve and accuracy.” Looks like there’s a major emphasis on the accuracy part, because a player with a 12-finishing certainly should not be scoring like this. Mechanically, this means the game is overriding a player’s base stats, such as finishing and weak foot rooting, and replacing them with near-perfect shot execution. The PlayStyle is an undeniably dominant variable in FC 26 , one that can make low-rated guys perform like the highest-rated players in the game . Here are some frustrated words from a player who confirms this issue: “Playstyles are 100% bypassing stats, absolutely. Every single Ultimate Scream player with that temporary 99 stat boost was absolutely useless. I have Joao Felix, and between when he had 99 pace and now, I noticed absolutely zero difference. And that’s because he doesn’t have a pace playstyle.” Adding to this problem is the developer’s dilemma. As one player summarized, there’s no way to close this “Pandora’s box without nerfing all of them into the ground and making a pivotal part of their current game worthless.” The Onana saga, initially dismissed as an edited clip, was definitively proven real by the creator’s live streams. BaldMun7 even did a separate run where a bronze center-back with Finesse+ was similarly dominant. Not a good look for what’s supposed to be the best football sim out there.",2025-12-17T00:19:44.034706,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/onana-at-striker-somehow-worked-in-ea-fc-26-fut-champs/,f1310a274c8a86ba909e67e7c23719c11880c67a,10,en,0.1,"In EA FC 26 , most players have long agreed that PlayStyles are the single most important metric when it comes to a player’s performance.

2025-12-13T10:06:04,FASTEST Money Methods AFTER Mansions DLC in GTA V Online,"With the mansions DLC for GTA V Online now out, it’s time to look again at what are some of the fastest methods to make money currently in the game. After all, you’ll need to make money to buy one of those expensive mansions! Plus, the mansions themselves also do give you some new avenues for moneymaking, surprisingly. In this guide, we’ll quickly tell you about all of the best moneymaking methods we know of after the A Safehouse in the Hills update. Faster Money Methods After Mansions DLC KnoWay Out Heist The first method we recommend is doing the KnoWay Out Heist. As we covered in our guide on starting it, you simply need to go to the yellow “A” icon on Little Seoul. Pick up the payphone there to start the Heist mission chain. By default, this Heist rewards you with about $525,000 upon completion. It does take a while to complete, as most Heists do, but it’s a fairly simple one and pretty rewarding! What’s more, completing the Heist as a Leader before December 17th, 2025 will net you a one-time Weekly Challenge bonus of $400,000! So, you can get $925,000 for your first time completing this Heist right now. We highly recommend doing this while the Weekly Challenge is still around, though this Heist should be decent for moneymaking even without the bonus. Home Sweet Home While we’re talking about missions, the new “Home Sweet Home” mission featuring Michael de Santa is another good way to get some good money fast. You’ll be automatically invited to do this mission sometime after you complete the KnoWay Out Heist and purchase a mansion. Just accept the invitation from Avi and you’ll instantly start it! The mission is pretty straightforward and not too long. However, it will reward you with a substantial bonus of $500,000 upon its first completion. Plus, you’ll get around $140,000 from completing the mission itself. Not too shabby! Participate in Featured Series Activities This is a method that’s always been around, but it’s worth reminding you of. To participate, go through your in-game phone and select Quick Job > Series Modes > Featured Series. Alternatively, you can find them as pink Rockstar icons on your map or in the Online tab of the pause menu. Just look for the activities with the x3 $ icons. Essentially, these are featured multiplayer modes that will give you a lot more money upon completion this week. Currently, the Hotring Circuit Stunt Races are the Featured Series. You can get triple RP and GTA$ by completing them, with particularly good earnings if you actually win the race! Time Trials Similar to the previous method, this is a classic . For this one, just make sure to do the currently available Time Trials. That is both the HSW Time Trials and the regular Time Trials. They change each week, but you can find them on your map. Beating the par time on regular Time Trials will reward you with around $100,000. Meanwhile, HSW Time Trials will reward you with around $252,000 but are a bit tougher. Either way, making sure to complete these Time Trials each week is a great way to get some extra money. They shouldn’t take too long to complete, either. Businesses Last but definitely not least, make sure to pay attention to your businesses! In particular, Meth Lab businesses are hugely discounted this week. If you haven’t started with them yet, now’s the time. This is even better if you have a mansion already, too. Having a mansion allows you to have Security to prevent the business from being raided, which simplifies maintenance. But, more importantly, the mansion allows you to boost the production of businesses via its AI assistant. We go over it in more detail on our mansion DLC guide , but this is a huge boon that can speed up your moneymaking! So, to summarize here, make sure to have your businesses up and running. Meth Labs are discounted this week and are highly recommended, especially when boosted via the mansion. There you have it! That’s all of the fastest money-making methods we know of in GTA V Online after the mansions DLC, A Safehouse in the Hills.

2025-12-13T09:10:44,Best Tips & Tricks for Ashes of Creation Early Access,"Ashes of Creation finally launched into Early Access on Steam, so it’s time for some best tips and tricks for beginners. This game, like most other MMORPGs, can be pretty daunting at first. Especially when learning to deal with some of its quirks, such as its inventory management system, or figuring out how to level optimally early. In this guide, we’ll give you a variety of tips to help make the early game smoother for you. Best Tips & Tricks Character Creation Tips As soon as you start the game, you will of course need to create a character. There are 8 class archetypes that you can pick from, each one fitting a different role and power fantasy. There’s the supportive Bard that empowers allies, the stealthy Rogue that does high burst damage, and the Tank that… well, tanks! That’s just to name a few, of course. If you want to get to know all of these classes more in-depth, check ou t our guide on the best class to play. It gives you a quick rundown of each one, allowing you to decide which one fits you best. That aside, you’ll also need to pick your Starting Region. We’ve gone over this in more detail in our starting area guide . But, to summarize, we highly recommend starting in The Riverlands (Divine Gate of Aela). This starting area is more polished and has a better quest flow overall. As such, it’s a smoother experience and is also the best way to learn the game as a new player. Do the Quests As soon as you start the game, you’ll be able to do some early game quests. This works a bit differently depending on your starting region, but it’s mostly the same for both regions currently. Basically, look for NPCs that have the diamond-shaped icons above their head. Talk with them to start and progress quests. The early quests are a fantastic source of XP, while also getting you some important things, such as your starting equipment. You’ll even get a mount later on in the main questline, which is important as the game features no fast travel! Also, while you’re at it, make sure to get as many Rations as you can from the early mobs, such as Goblins . Rations are a pretty solid healing item, and getting a good amount from mobs early will make things smoother for you. Complete Destinies Going hand in hand with the quests, you can also complete Destinies as you play the game. To check them out, you just need to press the L key. The Destinies serve two functions. One is that they act as a sort of tutorial, telling you how to perform basic actions and asking you to do them. The second function is that you get to claim and collect various goodies by completing the tasks. These mainly include some bonus XP, but there are also reward chests that give you some equipment! So, we highly recommend keeping track of Destinies. They’ll teach you how to play the game and reward you at the same time. Check out Commissions Tied to the previous two, we also recommend checking the Commission bulletin boards in every town. These allow you to, as you must’ve guessed, take on Commissions. These are essentially very basic quests. Most of them just require you to gather resources or hunt down some mobs, nothing too crazy. However, they can be decently rewarding as they give you a decent amount of XP and some Glint . If you don’t know yet, Glint is an important currency in this game. It can be traded for gold, used to purchase commodities, and even pay the housing taxes later on in the game. Do note, though, you’ll drop your held Glint on death! Make sure to store it at settlement warehouses or sell it to vendors to make some gold. Anyway, we recommend not ignoring Commissions. The earlier you start doing these, the better. Get That Bag Something that might trip new players early on is the inventory management system. It involves a grid-based system with limited slots and stacks , not dissimilar to something like Resident Evil 4. What’s more, your items are split into different bags , with some of them being specialized. For example, a Mining Satchel is only for resources obtained from mining and nothing else. To help alleviate the limited inventory, we highly recommend purchasing any bags you can. They are sold by equipment vendors and profession NPCs. Get them as soon as possible for a smoother experience. Grouping Is Recommended Early on in the game, you can easily play solo up until around Level 10 or so. It’s pretty doable without others as long as you follow our tips before, such as focusing on quests and doing Destinies. However, after Level 10, the leveling pace starts to slow down. So, it’s highly recommended to start seeking parties and guilds to play with others. This is, of course, even more important if you’re playing a group-oriented class such as Cleric, Tank, or Bard. But, ultimately, the game is designed so that playing with others is encouraged, making progression faster. Potential Quick FPS Fix Now, last but not least, we want to leave you with a potential fix to performance issues you might encounter. More specifically, you might notice that your FPS starts dropping the longer you play. So, this mainly affects players who are prone to playing in long single sessions. If you do notice this performance drop, you simply need to relog. Quit back to the character selection screen and just log back in! This should clear up the issue, fixing the FPS drops. Alternatively, you can try closing and relaunching the game. This should work too, but it’s just going to take a bit longer to load back in. Nonetheless, that’s the end of our list of the best tips and tricks for enjoying the Early Access launch in Ashes of Creation!

2025-12-04T13:55:40,Review: Gloomy Eyes (Nintendo Switch),"A game like Gloomy Eyes should’ve been reviewed in October, right? Not the holiday season in December? Well, here we are, anyway. Consider it a Nightmare Before Christmas kind of thing, which makes sense considering the Burton-inspired visuals. Gloomy Eyes is an adventure/puzzle game based on an animated VR short from 2019. You play as Gloomy (a zombie boy) and Nena (a living girl) who come together in hopes of finding the sun, which has been lost for a while. The art style, sound, and storytelling have a distinctly creepy vibe, but the game remains cozy and fun, with no major jumpscares or immediate present danger. The Gloomy Eyes world exists like a Super Mario Galaxy map, in which each level is a new setting with much to explore and many puzzles to solve. There is a starting point at each level, and your goal is always to find your way to the end. Of course, many obstacles block your way, and swapping between Gloomy and Nena will be required to get past—he can’t be in the light and she can’t be around zombies. These characters therefore must work together, but from separate parts of the level, to clear each other of any obstacles and find the way to the end. The game is single-player only, so expect a lot of switching between the two and finding what actions serve what purposes. For example, in the first couple levels where the two meet, you’ll play as Nena and find buttons within her area that shut off lights so Gloomy can then access areas where he’ll solve puzzles that help Nena in return. These areas are like dioramas from which you can back out and rotate to take it all in. They’re large, though, so you will spend plenty of time down close to the action, experimenting with the environments to figure out what to do. That’s the whole point, after all. Gloomy Eyes doesn’t do much to guide you, you’re just expected to scout the areas until you find the triggers to help the other progress. A large majority of the gameplay, therefore, centers around blind exploration and trial and error. Is that fun? Here, it kind of is, largely because finally figuring out how to progress is quite satisfying. It’s like advancing from one puzzle to the next in an escape room, and it doesn’t take much longer; Gloomy Eyes can be completed in just one or two sittings if you’re dedicated. You also don’t have to deal with being cramped in a tiny room with others who think they’re better puzzle-solvers than you. You are, however, struck with a cramped camera that makes it difficult to find what you need. In some areas, I wasn’t even able to detect that there were paths I could take. The muted colors and blurry graphics on the Switch don’t help, either. To stick with the Tim Burton reference, it needs the visual flair of Corpse Bride’s land of the dead, not the upstairs. And considering the short gameplay, Gloomy Eyes is just priced too high at $25. Still, I had fun with the game. The story is good, although cryptic in parts. The gameplay provides enough rewards to push you through the occasional frustrating elements. And although it’s single-player only, I recommend sharing it with others, especially younger gamers who’ll more easily connect with Gloomy and Nena. And no need to wait for next October to do so; it’s OK to be spooked in any given season.

Start playing The Forge via Roblox . For more on The Forge, find out if the first two minigames contribute to forge quality in my experimental guide! Best Areas To Farm Mining Shards in The Forge As of the BETA release, there are only two ways to get the Mining Shard Runes. This includes defeating Delver Zombies from the Stonewake Cross caves, or defeating Bomber Skeletons from the Sunken Cells or the volcano entrance rear within the Forgotten Kingdom Caves. Delver Zombie Location: Stonewake Cross Sub Locations: The Cave, Inner Cave, and Deeper Cave Layers Level range: 1-10 HP: 40-175 DMG: 12-30.4 Miner Shard Drop Chance: 1 in 35 Bomber Skeleton Location: Forgotten Kingdom Sub Locations: Crumbling Halls, Sunken Cells, and Ashen Passage Level range: 1-5 HP: 60-120 DMG: 70 DMG Miner Shard Drop Chance: 1 in 15 Despite having more serious damage overall, the Bomber Skeleton has a few seconds’ grace period before it detonates and deals that much damage. In that time, if you have a weapon capable of killing it, you won’t sustain any damage and reap all the rewards. I’m emphasising the Bomber Skeleton too, as it has a higher chance of dropping a Miner Shard, alongside other useful materials such as larger Essences, Boneite, and Blast Chips. Mining Shard Variants Mining Shards are the ideal counterpart for Pickaxes with Rune Sockets. Unlike other Runes, Miner Shards have tons of variation as opposed to only some or none. Luck : 5-16% Luck Increase on the Pickaxe. Yield : 3-10% chance for nodes to drop an additional Ore. Swift Mining : 4-12% Faster Mining. Mine Power : 8-15% extra Mining Damage. If sold to Greedy Cey, Mining Shards yield $25 per Rune. What are Runes? Runes can be socketed to Pickaxes, Weapons, and Armour to enhance their versatility. In the case of Mining Shards, these only apply to Pickaxes to make mining more efficient and fruitful. Runes drop from a series of enemies you encounter, primarily in the Forgotten Kingdom and beyond. If you want to enhance your equipment on a budget without investing in new tools, then Runes might be your go-to for that cutting-edge!

We’re pretty good at solving any mystery in The Forge . You can learn about all the types of Essence in The Forge with our other guide. How to Get Legendary Essence in The Forge At this current time, there is no way to obtain Legendary Essence in The Forge. This could be a new type of Essence that is going to be added to the game in the next major update, which is set for December 25th, with the addition of a brand new location. Now, we can at least speculate, right? Our first guess is that Legendary Essence will be a drop from enemies in the upcoming location . However, there’s a chance that some of the more difficult enemies in the Volcanic Depths may drop Legendary Essence, too. As we know, bosses are coming to The Forge, so this new essence type may be a potential drop from them! We will update this guide once a fully confirmed obtainment method for Legendary Essence is announced If you’ve recently tried to enhance a weapon or piece of armor, you may have noticed that Legendary Essence is a required resource for the next upgrade. Don’t worry, you’re not alone in this issue. Basically, whatever piece of equipment you’re trying to enhance right now is capped until Legendary Essence is available. What is Essence Used For? Essence is a key resource when enhancing your weapons and pieces of armor. The amount of Essence, as well as the type of Essence you have to use, depends on which Enhance level you’re upgrading to. The rarer the Essence, the better the upgrade. Enhancing your equipment can also increase the number of Rune Slots it has! This is especially useful if the equipment initially had 0 Rune Slots or just a single one. Make sure not to waste Essence on your weaker armor and weapons. Save the resource for your strong forged items!

2025-12-12T16:05:09,Divinity: Original Sin 2 PS5 & Xbox Series upgrade could be imminent following Divinity announcement,"Despite being the most-hyped reveal at The Game Awards 2025 , there’s a good chance you may not be familiar with the games that precede feature within the world of Divinity . However, it looks like RPG fans may soon get a fresh chance to experience one of the critically acclaimed RPGs that already put Larian Studios on the map before Baldur’s Gate 3 underscored their name and put lots of impossible to miss arrows pointing at them. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could soon be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. A year after the game’s initial release on PC, Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition was an improved version that came to PC, PS4 and Xbox One. Naturally you can already play these this game on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via backward compatibility, and also get to take advantage of 4K and HDR support from PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, but with with a legion of recently acquired fans, a native upgrade that spruces up the games with higher frame rate support and some other niceties like cross-play and cross-save would hardly go amiss. Ahead of the big reveal at The Game Awards, a post from PlayStation Game Size surfaced on social media , confirming the game’s existence on PS5. Given that this information comes from a pretty reliable source when it comes to leaking PlayStation Store data, hopefully we can expect an official announcement from Larian Studios in the coming days. In our Divinity: Original Sin 2 review we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”",2025-12-17T00:19:44.641811,Jim Hargreaves,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-could-be-imminent-following-sequel-announcement/,612cb2f13df86e32854c0bcc48b12cd7b167f10c,34,en,0.1,"Despite being the most-hyped reveal at The Game Awards 2025 , there’s a good chance you may not be familiar with the games that precede feature within the world of Divinity .

2025-12-12T16:00:40,Routine Review – This job is anything but…,"For long stretches since Routine was announced way back in 2012, it’s been easy to assume this was vapourware, that it would never be released. It is therefore with great delight that I can confirm that, not only is it fully complete, but it has actually turned out to fulfil all my expectations and more. The retro-futuristic stylings, the moments of sheer terror, and the fascinating storyline all combine to produce a game that is well worth the wait. The game’s title is a suitably tricky play on words, with dual references to the everyday nature of your job as a computer technician and the nature of the programs you interact with on the 1980s style terminals scattered around the lunar base. The aesthetic of the game draws equally on the Alien series and Duncan Jones’ Moon, with clear narrative echoes to both appearing as well. I am a sucker for this kind of vision of the future so have been eagerly awaiting the chance to immerse myself in Lunar Software’s debut game. Routine begins in standard science fiction disaster fashion. A lunar base outpost has suffered a complete systems breakdown shortly after the crew reported a mysterious finding. You take the role of a solo systems tech who must travel to the base and find out how to restore power and function. Little do you know that you will be exposed to mysteries and horrors beyond your imagination and find yourself changed in ways you never thought possible. The general atmosphere and aesthetics of Routine are superb, taking clear influence from the retro-futurism of films like Alien and Silent Running. Huge CRT monitors are littered around the environment with many being accessible for hacking with your gun-like multitool. Unlike many similar games, objects around you are more interactive, with intuitive prone and leaning mechanics being necessary to hide and navigate around parts of the environment. The early enemies are threatening and merciless but have nothing on what will face you later on. Environmental signposting is good and it is worth trying to orient yourself through this as there was no in-game map that I could find. While there is a degree of backtracking involved, the individual areas are compact enough to avoid this becoming a chore. Interacting with the world requires the use of your CAT (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), which looks like a gun but is not really an offensive weapon and feels more like a blend of a VHS camera and radar speed gun. You can fire off bolts of electricity to stun enemies, but this function was mostly used for puzzle solving in my playthrough. In the very beginning of the game the embedded tutorial teaches you that the CAT requires batteries (fortunately these are incredibly common around the map) with different modules you find along the way using up different amounts of power. Your first module is a Wi-Fi feature that lets you connect to the main terminals in the game – terminals that act as save points, task journals, and manual. This immersive menu is incredibly effective and means that you never have to break free of the game to save and access your journal whilst also ensuring that you need to find a terminal to access these functions. The immersive nature of the mechanics continues with the CAT itself which you have to directly engage with to insert batteries, activate the WiFi and also use the later module upgrades which require you to hold up the device’s miniature screen and zoom in. Puzzles range from looking for password codes to directly using the CAT functions to search the environment for hidden clues. These functions are introduced regularly throughout the game in a way that means you are never left doing the same thing for too long. The pacing of the game in general is excellent, unless you put it down for a day or two and forget your way around… Playing prior to release added a great deal of extra satisfaction as there were no walkthroughs or puzzle solutions to look up.

2024-05-13T10:00:00,REVIEW – Kudzu,"Embark on a nostalgic journey reminiscent of classic top-down action adventures with Kudzu , a recent release for the Nintendo Switch that harkens back to the golden era of The Legend of Zelda games. In this non-linear adventure, players assume the role of Max, an apprentice gardener on a mission to save his mentor from the clutches of a world-eating plant. While Kudzu captures the essence of its retro inspirations, it falls short in some key areas, resulting in a mixed gameplay experience. At its core, Kudzu offers simple controls reminiscent of its Game Boy predecessors. Movement is limited to four directions, with only two action buttons for interacting with people/objects and engaging in combat. While the streamlined control scheme stays true to its roots, the absence of diagonal movement may feel restrictive to some players. One notable departure from traditional action-adventure games is the lack of a defensive option. Unlike in Zelda games, players must rely on quick reflexes and evasive maneuvers to avoid enemy attacks, as there is no shield mechanic. While most enemies are easily avoidable, projectile-firing foes like spiders add an element of unpredictability and frustration to encounters. The initial stages of Kudzu offer a promising experience, with engaging gameplay and a captivating soundtrack that perfectly complements the game’s nostalgic aesthetic. The graphics strike a delicate balance between classic and contemporary, breathing new life into the familiar top-down perspective. However, as the game progresses, several issues begin to emerge. Backtracking becomes a common occurrence as players grind for mushrooms (the in-game currency) to purchase essential items like maps and a compass. While reminiscent of old-school game design, the repetitive nature of this process can become tedious and detract from the overall enjoyment. Furthermore, the inconsistency of enemy respawn rates and drop rates for mushrooms exacerbates the grinding process, hindering progression and impeding the player’s ability to quickly unlock new content. Unfortunately, Kudzu struggles to maintain its initial allure. The menu is a bit clunky, as it takes time to load and move between selections. And there are serious issues with the hit-box. Sometimes I am nowhere near an enemy and still take damage. But other times, I can walk right into an enemy and walk away scott-free. Despite its flaws, the game showcases ambition and potential, offering players a nostalgic trip down memory lane at a very affordable price point. While it may not yet reach the lofty heights of its inspirations, it serves as a testament to the enduring appeal of classic action-adventure gameplay. In conclusion, Kudzu is a promising yet flawed adventure that demonstrates the developer’s passion for the genre. With some fine-tuning and adjustments, it has the potential to evolve into a standout title for fans of retro-inspired gaming. At its current price point, it’s worth considering for those seeking a budget-friendly trip down memory lane, but be prepared for some rough patches along the way.

2025-12-15T14:00:12,COGconnected GOTY 2025 – Best Music,"COGconnected GOTY 2025 Best Music When it comes to game music, 2025 has been an absolute banger of a year. The keyword is eclectic. Composers have approached their projects with an open ear for different styles, pulling from diverse historical and cultural sources. Overall, acoustic and orchestral textures have dominated the best music this year, but there have been plenty of awesome synth or electronic-based scores as well. Great job, composers! 10. Deltarune: Chapters 3 and 4 Toby Fox is not only the creative force behind Deltarune, but the composer of one of this year’s most catchy soundtracks. Every track of Fox’s retro-electronic score for Deltarune is crawling with earworms just ready to hijack your brain. 9. Hollow Knight: Silksong The game might be incredibly challenging, but Christopher Larkin’s music is emotional, melodic and lush. Like many of the soundtracks on our GOTY list, it easily stands up to listening outside of the game. 8. Mario Kart World Lead by Atsuko Asahi, a handful of talented composers created an astounding seven-plus-hours of music for Mario Kart World. Maybe even more surprising is how consistently great the game’s big band, jazz, and funk score is. 7. Lumines Arise Lumines Arise is a game focused on mind-melting psychedelic visuals, washes of sound, and big beats that drive the action. This is one of the few almost entirely electronic scores on our list, although it does fold in atmospheric and evocative vocals for many tracks. 6. Silent Hill f Akira Yamaoka and Kensuke Inage are credited as composers for Silent Hill f. The score combines acoustic orchestral sounds, avant-garde processed sound, electronics, and traditional instruments to wash the gamer in a bath of uneasy musical cues. Uneasy music for a horror-and-tension filled game. 5. Death Stranding 2 On the Beach Ludvig Forssell’s score for Death Stranding 2 On the Beach is, like the game, epic, bold, and emotionally engaging. A blend of orchestra and electronics, Forssell’s music crosses the boundaries of style to perfectly serve the game’s dramatic requirements. 4. Hades 2 What’s the best way to describe Darren Korb’s soundtrack for Hades II? Four hours of awesome would be a start. With an assist by top-of-the-musical-leaderboards Austin Wintory, Korb’s music combines acoustic instruments, synths, Arabic influences, and much more. 3. South of Midnight As a game, South of Midnight sort of came and disappeared pretty quickly, but the score by Olivier Deriviere deserves to be on your permanent rotation playlist. A blend of swampy bayou rock, a cappella vocals, operatic-adjacent arias, and orchestral cues, the score is incredibly surprising and fresh. 2. Ghost of Yotei It isn’t surprising that Toma Otowa’s music for Ghost of Yotei blends traditional Japanese instruments and melodies with orchestra and subtle electronics. The surprise comes in just how much dramatic range Otowa is able to draw from those combinations. 1. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Congratulations to composer Lorien Testard for creating nearly nine hours of eclectic and beautiful music for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Ranging from intimate and heartbreaking vocals to dramatic battle music, Testard’s score is another example of why game music deserves an enormous amount of attention.

Alongside this release, the studio has confirmed that the game has now surpassed 500,000 sales since entering Early Access, marking a significant milestone for the project. The Reckoning expands Witchfire’s combat in a meaningful way by moving beyond pure gunplay. For the first time, players gain access to melee weapons, including a morgenstern, a katar, and a shield. These additions replace the basic fist with powerful alternatives, each offering distinct abilities and tactical value. Designed to flow naturally alongside firearms and magic, the new melee tools allow witch hunters to engage enemies up close without breaking the rhythm of combat. Ranged options have also grown with the introduction of three new firearms, highlighted by a long-requested triple-barreled shotgun. One standout weapon, the Tribunal, supports an aggressive run-and-gun approach. Dashing or sliding charges upcoming shots, while fully charged, overkills trigger a devastating shock explosion. When paired with melee attacks and spells, combat now feels more fluid, flexible, and deadly. To help players experiment with these tools, a new shooting range has been added. Featuring an interactive bestiary, it allows players to test builds and loadouts against enemies they have already defeated before heading back into dangerous expeditions. The update also brings quality of life improvements. Witchfire is now fully verified on Steam Deck and includes new accessibility options such as adjustable font sizes and an arachnophobia filter. A spider-themed calamity joins the list of cursed events, extraction mechanics have been reworked, and two new gameplay modifiers raise the challenge for veteran players.

2025-12-15T08:54:29,Haymaker Lands Its First Major Update Following the Ruff Talk Showcase,"Join the Brawl in Haymaker Haymaker has been building momentum since its launch on Meta Quest in November, delivering a raw, physics-driven take on virtual reality brawling. Now, Console Studios has revealed the game’s first major update during the Ruff Talk Showcase, introducing meaningful changes that deepen combat and raise the overall challenge. This update focuses on three key areas that directly impact how fights unfold. Players now gain access to a new dodge-to-counter system, expanded kick options, and more capable enemies with a broader range of attacks. Together, these additions make each encounter feel more dynamic and demanding. Dodging plays a central role in the new combat flow. Instead of relying purely on blocking, players can evade incoming strikes and immediately respond with a counterattack. This creates brief openings to regain control of a fight and rewards timing and awareness. The result is a smoother and more responsive combat experience that better highlights Haymaker’s physical interactions. Kicks have also received a notable upgrade. Alongside the existing techniques, players can now perform roundhouse and crescent kicks. These moves extend reach, add variety to offensive options, and allow for more creative combinations during close-range encounters. The added flexibility makes fights feel less predictable and more expressive. Enemies have not been left behind. Console Studios has expanded their movesets, giving opponents a wider selection of punches and kicks. This forces players to stay alert, adapt to new patterns, and fully engage with the updated mechanics. Haymaker is available in Early Access on Meta Quest headsets, priced at $14.99 USD, €13.99 EUR, and £11.99 GBP. The update is available now through the Horizon Store.

2025-12-16T13:58:58,Nobody watched the TGA show that probably announced one of the biggest games of 2026,"Whether you see The Game Awards as a hollow corporate show or an exciting celebration of this year in gaming, you likely missed a bunch of new game announcements that happened during the event. And no, I don’t mean nodding off during Highguard’s reveal. The Day of the Devs 2025 indie showcase is where all these announcements happened. The showcase streamed online two days before TGA, drawing about 65,000 viewers across the Day of the Devs and TGA channels at the time of writing. That means only three in 1,000 TGA viewers tuned in to watch it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY Day of the Devs offers new and promising indie game developers a free platform to display their games, and the partnership with TGA and Summer Games Fest ensures this happens in front of huge audiences. While the number of people who watched the showcase means most either didn't hear about Day of the Devs or straight out ignored it, it should've been one of the most anticipated moments of the event, as the games featured throughout its 11-year history prove. Massive indie hits had a spotlight at Day of the Devs Remember when the Hollow Knight developers were totally anonymous, and nobody knew if their game had any future? Well, I don't, but the Day of the Devs organizers do, because they showcased Hollow Knight in 2014, three years before the game launched, and 11 years before Silksong was nominated game of the year at TGA. Other games that Day of the Devs has helped gain visibility and break into the mainstream are Cuphead, Blue Prince, and Cocoon , which were all The Game Awards nominees when they launched. Some memorable gems that didn't become so popular but are still beloved by indie game fans like myself were also part of the showcase, like Spiritfarer, Untitled Goose Game , and the brutal Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrZxTS_eXLE Which Day of the Devs games may dominate 2026 I'm convinced the latest Day of the Devs is hiding the next big indie hit: A game we'll remember for years to come and that everyone will be praising in 12 months. My crystal ball is broken, so I can't tell you exactly which game it is, but I have some guesses. Stretchmancer has the potential to win awards in design and innovation. It kind of gives me Portal vibes, so I also believe it can break into the mainstream if its execution is great. It may be too cartoony and silly for some hardcore—and boring—gamers to take it seriously, but I'm confident about its future. It also seems like the perfect Nintendo Switch 2 game to use the new Joy-Con mouse controls. Awaysis is on my list to become not a hit with hundreds of thousands of concurrent players, but to be a kind of evergreen game that will come up whenever someone asks what's a fun game to play with friends on the couch. Like a new Overcooked . The Dungeon Experience is an extremely weird game in the best sense of the word. You're guided by a talking crab through a surreal but colorful and funny world full of dungeons. I bet this comedy game will be a hit among Twitch streamers for a few days or weeks. It might just lose in the long run to the co-op physics-based Frog Sqwad . All I know is that I'm wishlisting it all on Steam, and I hope I have enough time to play them all and say I was a fan before it was cool.

2025-12-16T13:56:09,How to find and open Winter’s Jest Krampus boxes in Phasmophobia,"This year's installment of Phasmophobia's Winter's Jest event has arrived, bringing with it plenty of festive fun to enjoy. One of the key tasks you need to tackle in this event is finding and opening Krampus boxes. All maps you can explore are quite vast and detailed, even the smaller ones, which can make finding these boxes rather tricky. It's much easier once you know where to look and how they work, though, so here's how to find and open Winter's Jest Krampus boxes in Phasmophobia . Table of contents Where to find Krampus boxes in Phasmophobia What do Krampus boxes look like in Phasmophobia? How to open Krampus boxes in Phasmophobia What do Krampus boxes do in Phasmophobia? Where to find Krampus boxes in Phasmophobia Screenshot by Destructoid Krampus jack-in-the-boxes can be found just about anywhere around all active Winter's Jest event maps in Phasmophobia . All of the maps that may have Krampus boxes are as follows. 10 Ridgeview Court 6 Tanglewood Drive Bleasdale Farmhouse 13 Willow Street 42 Edgefield Road Grafton Farmhouse Camp Woodwind Maple Lodge Campsite Point Hope Nell's Diner Each day, Krampus boxes will only spawn at four of these locations. You can tell which ones have them by checking the map board for all areas marked with a festive present icon. The event maps are on a daily rotation schedule, as are the Krampus boxes, so the exact areas you can visit to find them vary. Around each map, you can spot Krampus boxes on the ground, tables, chairs, beds, and just about everywhere else. They don't have fixed spawn spots or specific types of areas where they spawn. Instead, you might see one anywhere you look on any map. What do Krampus boxes look like in Phasmophobia? Screenshot by Destructoid Before you open them, Krampus boxes appear as dark red, simple boxes with a star on them that is a slightly lighter shade of red. All locations are quite dark, which means they blend in fairly well even when you know what you're looking for. Be sure to scan all areas carefully to avoid missing them. How to open Krampus boxes in Phasmophobia You can open Krampus boxes by simply approaching them and selecting the Interact button while looking at them. This is the same button you use to perform most actions while ghost hunting. On PC, it's left click by default, but it varies by platform or may have been changed if you switched your controls around. You can check when it is for you by opening the Journal, selecting Settings, switching over to the Controls tab, and locating the button next to the Interact option. If you want to change it, you can also do that from this page. What do Krampus boxes do in Phasmophobia? Screenshot by Destructoid Krampus boxes are essentially jack-in-the-boxes that pop open sometime after you interact with them, so be prepared for a bit of a jump scare when you do so. Opening these boxes scores you event points , thus helping both you and the entire Phasmophobia community get closer to unlocking event prizes. Interacting with these boxes is just one of the many ways you can contribute to the event's progress. If you're looking for additional methods to try, you may want to work on helping with the Naughty-or-Nice List next.

At the same time, Heroic Dungeons on PTR have been reverted to pre-nerf tuning. Raid Testing will also be open for Gruul and Magtheridon from 12:00 p.m. Noon PST on Friday, December 12 until 12:00 p.m. Noon PST on Monday, December 15. Gruul's Lair Raid OverviewMagtheridon's Lair Raid Overview Thank you for the feedback and discussions around raid difficulty on the upcoming Burning Crusade Classic Anniversary realms. Dungeons and Raids Although we still plan to release Tier 4 content (Karazhan, Gruul, and Magtheridon) in its post-nerf state, we recognize some of the community’s desire for more challenging content, and we want to continue the discussion and evaluate what that may mean for Tier 5 — specifically Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep. However, we want to experiment with delivering more challenging content elsewhere in TBC, and listen to the community to get their thoughts. We’re reverting Heroic dungeons on the PTR to use their “pre-nerf” tuning. Our hope is that this will provide the opportunity for more challenging content early on for players that want to the best gear as quickly as possible, while still allowing for a more casual raiding experience for all players for Tier 4. We’re looking forward to your feedback on this change to dungeons in the PTR. Raid Testing From 12:00 p.m. Noon PST on Friday, December 12 until 12:00 p.m. Noon PST on Monday, December 15, raid testing will be open for Gruul and Magtheridon. Arena Updates Arenas will be enabled soon on the PTR as part of a season test, which will run for several weeks. In addition to the Arena changes that were outlined in the initial PTR post, we’re adding additional adjustments. While our goal is to keep Arena gameplay in TBC mostly unchanged, we want extreme edge cases – such as both teams losing their DPS player – to still reach a natural resolution by adding a form of Dampening. 2v2 Dampening Begins at 20 minutes. Starts at 0% and increases by 6% per minute. Caps at 100% at 16 minutes and 40 seconds after the dampening began. 3v3 and 5v5 Dampening Is not active by default.

2025-12-16T14:46:40,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Studio Denies Rumours That Next Game’s Multiplayer is Like MW2,"While Activision has officially announced that it will no longer do consecutive games in the same Call of Duty sub series in a row , rumours had recently popped up that indicated that Infinity Ward might be working on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 as the franchise’s 2026 entry. One of these rumours has indicated that the multiplayer mode of Modern Warfare 4 will be “a complete copy of Modern Warfare 2 ”, referring to the 2022 iteration. As caught by Insider Gaming , this comes from TheGhostOfHope, who has in the past proven to be reliable with leaks about the franchise. “ Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer in its current state is currently a complete copy of Modern Warfare II except for no perk charging system and less ADS/slide penalties,” they wrote on social media. “There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II . Like I said in my last tweet it’s pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.” While Infinity Ward hasn’t made any concrete statements regarding the matter, the studio also took to social media to wish its fans happy holidays. Along with this, the studio wrote that Call of Duty fans shouldn’t believe everything they read on the Internet, before signing off from social media for the rest of the year. ‘Happy holidays everybody! Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon,” wrote Infinity Ward. “Don’t believe everything you read on the Internet. See you in 2026.” In response to Infinity Ward’s statement, TheGhostOfHope wrote yet another post where he said that the studio typically hasn’t responded to these leaks in the past. The fact that it has gone out of its way to try and “generically deny” two recent leaks, notes the leaker, “should raise some red flags”. Further, TheGhostOfHope also wrote that they still have the same sources they had with their previous leaks regarding games like Modern Warfare 2 and 3 , and Black Ops 6 and 7 . “The fact that a billion dollar studio has gone out of its way to *generically* deny 2 of my most recent leaks when they’ve never done it before nor towards others is frankly very weird and should raise some red flags about why they’d do such a thing when they never did it before. I have largely kept the same sources for years and my MW4 leak is no different to that. I would never sink my reputation with COD leaking that I’ve built over the years on faulty unverified info,” wrote the leaker. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S just last month. For more details, take a look at our review .

2025-12-16T14:03:01,Tomb Raider: Catalyst is a “Complete Adventure Top to Bottom” So Newcomers Don’t Feel Lost,"The recently-unveiled Tomb Raider: Catalyst represents the next major steps for the franchise. Crystal Dynamics, however, wants to make sure that newcomers to the franchise don’t feel completely lost. As caught by GamesRadar , studio head Scott Amos spoke about Tomb Raider: Catalyst , and how the game will appeal to fans of the franchise as well as newcomers during a virtual Q&A event after The Game Awards 2025. Amos explained that this comes down to the fact that Tomb Raider: Catalyst will focus on Lara Croft at the furthest point in her adventuring career. This also means that all other Tomb Raider games make up parts of her history. “For longtime fans, it’s one of those moments where this is the furthest point in [Lara Croft’s] career,” he said. “This is really where she is right now. Everything else is her history.” As for new players, Amos noted that Tomb Raider: Catalyst has been designed so as to make sure that players can jump right into it, and that “there’s no homework required”. He has described the upcoming game as having a “complete adventure top to bottom,” which makes understanding the story and characters easy even if you might not be aware of the backstory of protagonist Lara Croft. “We’ve designed Catalyst so that players can jump in right now and pick up with her adventures as is, like I say, there’s no homework required,” Amos explained. “You can jump right into Catalyst and feel this [is a] complete adventure top to bottom, and understand the story and the characters without having to know any of that pre-history.” He went on to reiterate that Tomb Raider: Catalyst is going to be the biggest game in the franchise that Crystal Dynamics has made so far. “So we’re super excited about bringing this experience to everyone.” Game director Will Kerslake had previously spoken about Tomb Raider: Catalyst , and how it will take place after the events of 2008 title Tomb Raider: Underworld . In an interview, Kerslake also noted that the reboot trilogy from the 2010s would serve as the origin story for Lara Croft in the new Unified Timeline. “From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld , with the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we’re seeing a more experienced Lara Croft,” he explained. Kerslake had also spoken about new players coming to Tomb Raider: Catalyst not having to worry about the franchise’s baggage in its 3-decades-long history. “What’s important to know is that this is a new chapter in Tomb Raider,” he said. “So whether you followed Lara from the start, or this is your first Tomb Raider game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is designed to stand on its own as an adventure that can be enjoyed by everyone.” Tomb Raider: Catalyst is being developed for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and is slated for release in 2027. In the meantime, a remake of the first game in the series has also been in development.

2025-12-16T16:03:52,Phasmophobia adds three new ghost types alogside returning Winter update,"Phasmophobia sneakily added in three new ghost types, alongside deploying the new winter update to the game. The winter update is the yearly returning event, adding in Krampus-themed content to the maps. However, as part of the regular game update, there are now three new ghost types added to Phasmophobia, featuring the Dayan, Obambo and Gallu ghosts to throw some curve balls to the mix. The update launches the standard winter event, where players will have christmas modifiers on certain maps on the board,  indicated by the christmas present icon on the map board. The week will have double xp and money for the first week, from Dec 16-23, and will have community reward milestones to reach for new ID cards and other rewards. But, the big news of the patch is they secretly added new ghost types to Phasmophobia, which are as follows: Dayan Ghost Type The Dayan Ghost Type is a new ghost with its niche all about getting too close to it. It will share similarities with the Jinn in its place of death. However, you will not only need to work out the location it likes, but also the actual location of the ghost itself. To detect the ghost, you will require the following evidence: EMF Level 5 Ghost Orb Spirit Box Playing on harder difficulties, you will probably want Ghost Orb and EMF Level 5, especially the one pointing to event locations. This should help you find the exact spot to make it easier tracking it. Camera and Ghost Orbs will likely help find its locations too. From there, you can walk in tough areas, trying to work out where it is, presuming you have strong Crucifixes nearby to prevent immediate hunts while you try to walk directly at it. If you know where the ghost is, standing still makes it weaker, which should help you work out what the Dayan is amongst other more territorial ghost types in the game. In terms of its secret behaviours, it seems like the Dayan behaves similarly to the Raiju. The ghost moves faster when you move, and its speed slows down when you stop during hunts. Gallu Ghost Type Gallu is one of the more aggressive ghost types, rivalling that of a Demon and Revenant. This ghost shares some similarities with the Obake, as it will get angrier the more you use protective equipment around it, like how the Obake uses flames around it. To detect this ghost, you will need: EMF Level 5 Ultraviolet Spirit Box The strength of the ghost is that using protective equipment will strengthen the ghost by making them less effective. Things like Crucifix and incense spring to mind. These will gradually get less effective over time, so make studying this ghost fast as you’ll find longer more aggressive hunts more common. However, the ghost also finds that being enraged exhausts the ghost, making those very same protective equipment even stronger. Obambo Ghost Type The Obambo’s lore is a ghost type that has mixed emotions, with it being both aggressive and calm, depending on encounter. The ghost can be determined by the following evidence: Ghost Writing Ultraviolet D.O.T.S Projector The strengths of the ghost can be found via very fast hunts, making it hunt above 70% sanity if it wants based on early reports, making it up there with Revenants and Demons. The weakness of the ghost is that the ghost in its calm state can take a while to hunt. And when it does hunt, it is very slow to hunt and very easy to track during chases. It will likely confuse players. So, this ghost will likely be confusing to determine early. So, you’d need to work out what hunt type it has while gathering evidence. In other news, Phasmophobia is coming ot the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. We are also expecting the game to officially leaver early access in 2026 too, based on The Game Awards antics.

2025-12-16T15:27:41,Wreckreation devs resort to Patreon as last ditch effort to keep Burnout successor alive,"UK-based studio Three Fields Entertainment is using its last bits of juice to try to get the spiritual successor to Burnout, Wreckreation, over the finish line. This comes after nearly two weeks of uncertainty, as the developer put its ten staff on redundancy notices. In an email, posted to Bluesky by deals wizz, Wario64, from CEO and co-founder, Fiona Sperry, she lays out the plan. According to Sperry, it would cost the company $65,000 a month to keep the ten-person team together. Currently, they’re investigating “multiple ways” to make this happen, but its first major step is to launch on Patreon . The bottom line is that they’re trying to get “six months of time to make the updates to Wreckreation” that the team promised. Three Fields Entertainment is now asking for Patreon support to continue developing updates for Wreckreation www.patreon.com/cw/u10680381 — Wario64 (@wario64.bsky.social) 2025-12-16T13:44:40.640Z Never heard of Wreckreation? Don’t worry, it didn’t seem like the publisher didn’t either If you’re only now hearing about Wreckreation, don’t worry, you’re not alone. I’ve learnt about it through industry veteran Jeff Gerstmann’s podcast, where he also discovered that it had slipped out onto Steam mostly unnoticed. In fact, he had to ask THQ Nordic about it, who Sperry wrote in the redundancy announcement were showing a lack of “enthusiasm or financial support”. Wreckreation is supposed to be a spiritual follow-up to Burnout. However, at launch, massive amounts of complaints came in from expectant players about bugs, and that the game felt “unfinished”. It also has some ties to the user-generated content push that’s been popping up in some games. This has led some players to see the world as empty, when it appears to be more of a starting point for player ideas. Despite its rocky launch, the game sits on an overall “Mixed” Steam review score, or “Very Positive” thanks to recent updates to the game. So what’s even on the Patreon? Four tiers are being offered on Patreon, with Boost Chainer, Point of Impact, and x Wow tiers offering “exclusive vehicle livery” (that’s a fancy word for “car skin”). The highest two tiers also include “Impact Game Design”, which lets big spenders get involved with commenting on upcoming additions being added to the game. There’s also this trailer posted to a blog: Probably the last time you’ll find this talent making a Burnout successor I didn’t just name-drop Gerstmann for the sake of it, as in last week’s episode, he discussed the game once again. I think he’s right when he says that if people don’t get on the ground floor with this game, there will never be another one of these. At least, not in the way that Burnout fans want after years of dormancy. Video should play from highlight, if not 1:58:00 Look, EA is never going to make one of these again, and whatever remains of Criterion is now trapped in the Battlefield 6 mines. No, seriously, they even – for a little bit – had a tagline of “A Battlefield Studio” attributed to them. This is genuinely, probably, the last time you’ll get hold of one of these with the calibre of talent behind it. What, expecting Star Wars to stick the landing with Galactic Racer?

2025-12-16T14:50:56,92-year-old bests the rest in elderly Tekken 8 tournament,"Trust some elderly Japanese folks to come up with a positive story around Tekken 8. Esports association, Care, has been running tournaments since 2019, with its last two introducing Tekken to the mix. Typically, Care would have them play less action-oriented games, but has been all in on Tekken since the Summer. In the most recent tournament, 92-year-old Hisako Sakai beat 74-year-old Gorō Sugiyama in a Claudio and Lili showdown. The match is hilarious off the bat, with the pair gunning for each other immediately with some heavy button mashing. Despite his younger age, Sugiyama was completely decimated by Sakai’s Claudio button-mashing. It was so intense, the 92-year-old didn’t even drop a round. I’m taking her tips and tricks over any esport professional in the future. The Care Esports YouTube channel has full matches split across YouTube. I think what makes this even more of a delight is that it’s semi-professionally produced, with commentators and everything. Elderly game tourney is the best news Tekken has had in months It’s some positive news for Tekken, as the latest entry, 8, hasn’t been best received by players. A few months ago, complaints stemmed from a balance update with Season 2, which apparently made the game a bit too shallow for legacy players. There are other complaints that dig into the minutiae, but most updates haven’t brought the game in line with where the vocal players want. Even our own fighting game-obsessed Olivia Richman has been critical of the game in her coverage, calling it “cooked” . Then, on December 8, the series’ steward, Katsuhiro Harada, announced he was leaving Bandai Namco. Fans are now concerned over who might follow, even saying that they don’t want it to be a “white guy”. Harada was director or producer on almost every Tekken game from 3 onwards, starting out as a voice actor for the game. For Tekken 8, he was Executive Producer, matching with his statement that he’d been handing off responsibilities in the lead-up to his retirement from the company. While Tekken might be in the dumps, I’m going to spend my lunch watching these elderly people mash on controllers like pianos.

2025-12-16T14:02:42,Metroid Series Retrospective: Nintendo’s overlooked MVP,"Nintendo’s reputation for family-friendly adventures has always been slightly at odds with its own Metroid series. While Samus’ bounty-hunting exploits are closer to PG than anything cooked up by the Alien franchise, it’s admittedly difficult to imagine many of Nintendo’s other mascots going toe-to-toe with nightmarish parasites or cyborg space pirates. In many ways, it’s this unexpected style and darkness that help Metroid carve its own niche as a beloved part of the Nintendo family. And yet, it is perhaps also the reason why it has never received the same promotion and lavish care from within the company itself as staples like Zelda and Mario , while arguably being their equal in innovation and quality. The Escapist recaps The Metroid series has gone long periods without new game releases. Many of the series’ highlights are counted among Nintendo’s strongest titles. Metroid Prime completely redefined the series for 3D, while leaving space for 2D adventures like Fusion and Dread to succeed. Fresh developer perspectives outside of Nintendo led to risks for Metroid , but also a strong sense of passion and exploration. Metroid franchise history Samus Aran is one of Nintendo’s longest-serving heroes. Image credit: Nintendo, Retro Studios Metroid ’s Nintendo pedigree is inarguable, with the series amassing multiple generations of fans across its releases that stretch all the way back to the NES. And yet, unlike other bustling franchises that started out on Nintendo’s earlier platforms, the Metroid series’ history boasts comparatively few mainline titles. Most Nintendo consoles feature an appearance by Samus in some form or other, being a mainstay on the Smash Bros . roster helps in that respect, but the Metroid series has often gone surprisingly long without a follow-up seeing the light of day. While a dedicated fanbase has followed the series down through the years, Metroid ’s lack of true breakout appeal on the Switch and beyond can be traced to this somewhat irregular presence. Still, when the stars align and a new Metroid game arrives, it is very often a huge hit. The Metroid series timeline charts the evolution of many of the most well-thought-of titles in the entire Nintendo library. The original NES Metroid has seen numerous Virtual Console re-releases, homages in other Nintendo titles, and a highly praised re-release on the Game Boy Advance as Zero Mission, proving that the series’ fundamentals perfectly stand the test of time. Metroid 2 proved a worthy – albeit polarizing – sequel, but its SNES follow-up Super Metroid is where the series truly etched itself into many fans’ hearts with sheer quality and spectacle. The back-to-back release of Metroid Fusion and the Metroid Prime trilogy saw the series at its peak, excelling in both its classic 2D form and a visionary new first-person reinvention. Sadly, the history of Metroid games took an awkward turn in the DS era, failing to make much impact with Metroid Prime: Hunters and Metroid Prime: Federation Force . But thankfully, modern Nintendo consoles are finally bringing Samus back in from the cold. A well-received modern Metroid resurgence has truly kicked off thanks to the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4 and the tense, 2D return-to-form of Dread , following a brief trip through ignominy by way of the misguided Other M . Nintendo’s Big Three Metroid Prime 4 continues the beloved offshoot series. Image credit: Nintendo, Retro Studios Despite the series’ often lengthy gaps between releases and an occasional dip in quality and popularity, understanding the Metroid franchise leads to an appreciation for how the games excel in a way only matched by Nintendo’s other true flagships: Zelda and Mario . More recent powerhouse breakouts, such as Animal Crossing , have brought in stratospheric player numbers that surpass Metroid ’s. Still, that franchise evolution has been much more iterative than the full reinvention that Prime brought to Metroid . Indeed, it’s the diverging path o f Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion that truly showed why Metroid is Nintendo’s overlooked MVP, proving to be both a total reinvention of the franchise and a striking refinement of the series’ strengths. Many Nintendo classics like Pokémon handled the tricky transition from 2D to 3D with relative grace, but Zelda , Mario , and Metroid alike kept their classic formulas alive and thriving alongside their bold new offshoots. While Metroid Prime arrived a console generation later than Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , it served as a similar smash hit that successfully translated Metroid’s mechanics into 3D and brought its own tricks to the table. Crucially, rather than the series fully forging ahead with the Prime games and no others, Fusion and Dread provide classic 2D Metroid experiences in the same vein as the side-scrolling New Super Mario Bros. and top-down Zelda games like Minish Cap and A Link Between Worlds . Freedom to explore Metroid Dread was a true return to form for Samus’ adventures. Image credit: Nintendo, MercurySteam The Metroid series’ history and evolution are set apart from those of Nintendo’s core franchises, and with stricter oversight. While Metroid ’s overall gameplay quality and series trajectory may mirror Mario and Zelda , its development history is another story. Often enough, outside studios have been able to bring their own interpretations to Nintendo spin-off titles, creating well-received, offbeat experiments like Paper Mario (though many ended up on a notably tighter creative leash in later series entries). These externally developed takes on Nintendo’s icons always existed in addition to main series entries. However, Metroid: Other M , developed in partnership between Nintendo and Team Ninja, is counted among Samus’ true mainline adventures, much as many longtime fans might wish to decanonize it. Other M proved to be a deeply controversial entry in the series, with what many players felt was a mischaracterization of Samus and base-breaking combat among its main flaws. It can be argued that this major slip was enough of a risk to the franchise that it likely wouldn’t have been allowed to get off the ground floor for more protected franchises in Nintendo’s wheelhouse . This lighter grip on the Metroid IP is perhaps a tacit acknowledgement that Nintendo’s developers have lower confidence and less of a clear heading for the franchise than Mario and Zelda ’s successful later-day reinventions. All this being said, it is also this comparatively hands-off approach that has brought much of Metroid ’s personality back to the fore. Without the insight and direction of Retro Studios and MercurySteam, Metroid would never have redefined itself with a bold leap forward, nor found its way back to steadier ground after a series of missteps. While Nintendo will always invest heavily in Mario and Zelda , the passion that Metroid has ignited in other fans and developers has injected fresh creative purpose into the series, and it’s that outside perspective that ensures Metroid ’s place among Nintendo’s most exciting, enduring series. Ask The Escapist Will Metroid Prime 4 have DLC? Metroid Prime 4 does not currently have DLC content announced. Are Metroid Prime 4 and Metroid Dread connected? The Metroid Prime games take place earlier on the Metroid timeline than Dread, with Dread currently being the last entry on the timeline. Is Metroid Dread a sequel? Metroid Dread is a sequel to Metroid Fusion, with the story following on from where the GBA title ends. Will there be a Metroid Prime 5? Currently, no sequel to Metroid Prime 4 has been confirmed.

2025-12-16T14:24:13,How to complete Groundbreaking in ARC Raiders,"The Groundbreaking quest is a new activity to finish in ARC Raiders , which forms part of the Cold Snap update. Thankfully, it's fairly easy to finish off. All the tasks can be completed on the Blue Gate map, and there are four of them. This guide will help you finish all the tasks. ARC Raiders Groundbreaking quest walkthrough The Groundbreaking quest can be broken down into the following parts. Enter the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak Search the room for any construction research Find the building pictured on the whiteboard Photograph the abandoned housing project Once you accept the quest from Apollo, he will provide you with the Blue Gate Communication Tower key. Make sure to keep the item safe since you'll need it to proceed with the quest. Next, head to Pilgrim's Peak on the Blue Gate map. Enter the building from the entrance marked on the screenshot below. Go straight, and then turn left. Travel straight until you come across a locked door to your right. This is where you use the key. Head inside and you'll find a whiteboard. Investigate the whiteboard, and you'll automatically complete the second and third tasks of the quest. Screenshot and Remix by Destructoid The final part of the quest is slightly tricky since you'll have to stand at a specific location at the Abandoned Housing project. Head to the marked location, and you'll find the spot where you have to take the photo. You will first have to reach Abandoned Housing before proceeding to this spot.

Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar. To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can. Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.

If you're looking to find the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak, or need to know where to find the building pictured on the whiteboard, we'll fill you in on how to complete this quest here. You don't need to extract to complete Groundbreaking, but you'll receive the Blue Gate Communication Tower Key upon accepting this request, so you need to bring it into the raid with you . As such, you'll want to bring an augment with a safe pocket so that you don't accidentally lose this key during your journey to Pilgrim's Peak. If you do lose it, you'll have to wait to find another one (which is entirely random) or just hope you can catch the door open from someone else's key at some point.

2025-12-16T21:05:00,Terminator 2D: No Fate Review - No Problemo,"If I could use only one word to encapsulate Terminator 2D: No Fate, it would be ""authentic"": Both in the way it faithfully recreates James Cameron's seminal 1991 action movie and its nostalgic love affair with the 16-bit era of video games. Movie tie-ins were mostly awful in the early '90s, but I could easily see myself renting No Fate from my local Blockbuster and blasting through its sidescrolling run-'n'-gun action in between episodes of Dragon Ball Z and WWF Smackdown. It's a brief experience, with the credits arriving in less time than it takes to watch the entirety of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but No Fate is a licensed video game done right, created with palpable reverence for both its source material and the era of video games it emulates. No Fate's story mode opens with a shot of rolling tarmac, as the painted yellow lines in the middle of the road scroll past at regular intervals. If you're a fan of Terminator 2, this shot will be a familiar sight, albeit one now rendered in gorgeous pixel art, with chiptune music and Sarah Connor's monologue presented as blocks of text rather than through Linda Hamilton's hushed tones. It's also in a different place--on a desert road instead of a Los Angeles freeway--and opens the game as opposed to bookending the movie.

Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company. It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!

Keep in mind that you need to complete every step of this quest in a single round. This means that dying before you wrap things up will result in you having to redo the steps next time you load in. However, you do not need to extract to get credit for completion, so once you've finished the quest, dying won't be as big of a deal. We'd still recommend you try to extract, though, of course.

In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6. ""It's progressing really well,"" Howard told Game Informer . ""The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right."" Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after Starfield was released in 2023.

2025-12-17T00:00:00,2026 Holy Horror Mansion Cross-Media Event Planned by Level-5,"Holy Horror Mansion , bulled as a cross-media project and “Concept Next Yo-Kai Watch ,” will apparently be fully revealed during a 2026 Level-5 event. The company confirmed the planned Fall 2025 reveal is officially canceled on social media and updated the official English website to go over “merchandise and media developments.” Like Yo-Kai Watch , Holy Horror Mansion will involve ghosts and spirits and be a JRPG, but the official site bills it as a “ghost craft RPG.” The initial teaser trailer for it, which debuted in September 2024, and screenshots on the site also suggested that sort of approach. It follows Ten Lordland, a kid living in a mansion atop an apartment building that finds an unusual camera. After interacting with it, he ends up meeting the first of three ghosts. That green one can enter objects to bring them to life. The blue one can be used to combine objects to turn them into a single object. The pink ghost seems to be able to build worlds/dungeons. However, there’s also a suggestion that the De Ville Corp company could exploit ghosts and the supernatural for money. Here’s that official teaser. It featured Santa, Pikotaro, and Avantgardey as the inspiration dancers for the three ghost dances. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDeVTergiQs This game first came up during the Level-5 Vision 2024 showcase . At the time, a Spring 2025 Holy Horror Mansion cross-media project presentation going over the possible “Concept Next Yo-Kai Watch” game, anime, and merchandise came up. That got delayed to Fall 2025 in June 2025 . Now in December 2025, the tentative date for the next event involves a general 2026 window. Holy Horror Mansion is in development for unspecified consoles and devices, and we could see other media elements like an anime adaptation.

2025-12-16T18:00:00,Hollow Knight Switch 2 and Silksong Expansion Arrive in 2026,"Team Cherry announced two updates regarding the Hollow Knight series, with the first being a Switch 2 version of the original game and the second being a free Sea of Sorrow expansion for Hollow Knight: Silksong . Both will appear in 2026. Also, while the Switch 2 version is unique, it will be released alongside updates for every version.

2025-12-16T16:00:17,Tales of the Abyss Story Written in Under 2 Months,"In an interview about the making of Tales of the Abyss , the original development staff from Bandai Namco (then simply Namco) discussed how writer Takumi Miyajima penned the overall story of the game in only a month and a half. The full interview is available in Japanese on Denfaminico . Miyajima joined the project closer to the end of development, which is not the norm. The team had about four different story ideas, but none of them were going well. It had been difficult to come up with a hook, as well as a story that would be even more shocking than Symphonia ’s. That was why they asked Miyajima to join the team and create a story from the partially-made game they had. Miyajima started working on Tales of the Abyss in March 2004, and he finished writing the setting details and story on April 13, 2004. He says that this was soon after Symphonia , so he was still tired, and Abyss ’s schedule was even tighter than Symphonia ’s. So he was thinking, “I wish everyone would just blow up” while working on it. Despite the rush, he worked on the finer details and timeline of Auldrant until July, as Namco hadn’t chosen a producer yet. Abyss ’s story can still spawn a lot of debate and discussion, and this was true even during the development stage. Many staff commented to Miyajima that it would be more natural for Asch to be the protagonist and POV character, but Miyajima didn’t think it odd for Luke to have the spotlight. The prologue to explain everything that happened to Asch would demand too much time and investment from the player. However, with an “amnesiac” Luke as the protagonist, they could cut out all that information. This also makes him easier for the player to relate to, as he is as clueless about the world as they are. Though Abyss is a story about replicas, making the player empathetic towards the player was more important. It also focused on the theme of self-discovery. This matched the target age group of Tales of the Abyss , since most Tales players during the early 2000s were middle-to-high schoolers. Tales of the Abyss is available on the PS2 and Nintendo 3DS. Bandai Namco will likely release a remaster of it, but it has not revealed any concrete information on that yet.

2025-12-16T15:00:58,Yoshiki Okamoto Will Close All Changokushi NFT Games in 2026,"Okakichi has announced that it will shut down its entire Changokushi series of mobile NFT games in early 2026. The blockchain game project spearheaded by Yoshiki Okamoto will have its curtains closed after running for just over a year. [Thanks, 4Gamer .] For the record, Changokushi was originally teased as Project K , which was an attempt by Yoshiki Okamoto in the blockchain scene before his planned retirement in 2027.

2025-12-16T14:00:00,Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC Can Offer a Challenge,"We aren’t getting to leave Lumiose City with the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC, but the add-on is giving us a new way to look at it. The $29.99 paid addition is primarily focused on sending us into Hyperspace Lumiose via Hoopa-created portals so we can face new Pokemon (who are wildly strong) and face new Mega Evolved Pokemon (who are incredibly intimidating) alongside some new smaller quests in the city proper. While it is a good way to get some new characters for our parties and the new Mega Evolutions are interesting, it also feels designed to offer a greater endgame challenge for individuals. There are honestly a few different parts to the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC that all tie together, and these consist of an extra campaign, the Hyperspace Lumiose pocket “dungeons,” and an array of additional side quests that involve new fights, new Pokemon, more items, and even cosmetics based on some of the major characters we encountered in the original story. It’s really substantial and designed to incentivize returning after saving the city and appreciating what it’s like when it is (relatively) peaceful. Screenshots by Siliconera In the case of the campaign, that is the primary source of additional endgame challenges in the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC and involves the greatest difficulty spikes. Things begin with a young girl named Ansha and her Hoopa approaching team MZ. She wants to find a certain legendary Pokemon for her mom that she encountered in a Hyperspace pocket dimension. However, the only way she can keep searching is by creating donuts to give Hoopa the energy to create these portals. This is a benefit to us as well, as these Hyperspace Lumiose spaces sometimes contain Rogue Mega Evolved Pokemon and Ansha and Hoopa’s arrival was accompanied by a portal over the top of where the city’s tower once stood. With the help of Corbeau and Vinnie, we take part in the investigation of the portals, aid more Mega Evolved Pokemon, and make the donuts. The donuts are the main mechanic for entering these portals, and the berries and quality of them affect the types of perks (like increased shiny or alpha appearance odds), the level boost for our own Pokemon, and the amount of time we can send in the dimension before being kicked out. As we go through the original campaign for the add-on, we’ll get better quality butter for Ansha and find higher quality Hyper berries. This allows us to use more berries in recipes, get greater level boosts, and more additional perks. So everything is constantly feeding into each other and scaling to increase our odds of success. Fighting and catching Rogue Mega Evolved Pokemon give us the new Mega Stones and a character that can use them. As a QOL feature, we can see right away how long we can stay in (the calories), and the portal will show icons or silhouettes for the three types of Pokemon inside when it doesn’t involve the rogue “boss” fight. Now, it’s that part of things that prove potentially exhilarating. As we go through this Mega Dimension DLC campaign, there can be 2v2 battles pitting our character and an ally against two other notable ones from the original Pokemon Legends: Z-A adventure. Those are fantastic and lead to some fun interactions between folks who normally didn’t work together or associate with one another. Matches against Pokemon in the dimensions can be fun due to the diversity and number attacking us at once. When you have a horde of at least three coming at you, you need to change tactics! The Rogue Mega Evolved fights are also interesting, but I honestly hated the stress of them this time around. In addition to protecting our avatar, staying safe, and ensuring we had the proper Pokemon prepared to fight, there’s that time limit before Hoopa’s portal closes to consider. It can be a lot, and I found my level 70-ish Pokemon from the campaign were getting to 80 and higher without much trouble. Screenshots by Siliconera While that is good for folks who crave that difficulty, it isn’t the only thing going on here. As I mentioned before, there are a lot of new missions in Lumiose City proper because of this. Gimmighoul and 413 of its coins are given to us as part of one, and we get the other coins by finding sparkling items on the ground in Hyperspace Lumiose sometimes. By taking part in one fight, I got a Jacinthe’s Dress replica and a ton of money. I kept an eye on a Mime Jr. There are more TMs to get. Some of these are just fun activities, while others are some interesting fights that can test our skills a bit. The Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC feels designed to give people an array of reasons to test themselves and keep coming back to the game once they beat it. More Pokemon? Yup. Stronger Rogue Mega Evolved Pokemon fights and trainer battles against returning characters? That’s there. Opportunities to explore the city and enjoy fun interactions. Yeah.

The Bonus Recruit will also be extended for another year and include two more characters. Finally, a list of planned Surface Content improvements and updates were mentioned. The updates on the 2026 Goddess of Victory: NIKKE crossover collabs and campaign plans came up in the general yearly plan teaser. Shift-Up noted a priority will be “to give more focus to NIKKE ’s own story.” This is why there will only be two other IPs appearing in-game next year. In 2025, we saw new and returning ones with Resident Evil , NieR: Automata , Stellar Blade , and Evangelion . Rapi: Red Hood herself is also a rerun, as the alt of the character appeared for the first time as part of the New Year’s 2025 update . As for the Goddess of Victory: NIKKE Bonus Recruit characters, two existing characters will join Alice, Liter, and Naga. Helm, an SSR Attacker with a Sniper Rifle who deals water damage, is one of them. The other is Tia, an SSR Defender with a Rocket Launcher who deals Iron damage. We can redeem up to 1,000 points, instead of 600, after the update. Also, the change means that period will end on December 31, 2026, rather than the end of this year. Finally, here is the tentative list of Surface changes coming to the game. 1. Movement speed improvement Significantly increase the movement speed when not in combat Improve the utilization of Rapid Deployment (remove required currency and attempt limits) 2. Ease of use improvement Improve responsiveness for mobile controls Improve touch input logic to reduce unnecessary touches 3. Gameplay pressure reduction Limit sector units to hours during the early exploration phase to spread out playtime Significantly reduce the occupation requirements for main gameplay, such as gateway battle Significantly reduce the HP of Tyrant-class Raptures Make changes so that occupied areas are permanently saved when captured (removal of the battery concept) Completely revamp the usage of the hospital Change the main consumption points for Surface materials from the factory to Hexacode Block production to ease pressure Goddess of Victory: NIKKE is available for PCs and mobile devices, and 2026 will mark the return of Rapi: Red Hood and two new crossovers with other IPs.

He’ll show up in Japan on April 25, 2026. He will cost 7,480円 (~$48). No worldwide pre-orders are open for it yet. However, the official Square Enix Store does carry other Form-ism figures, so we should see it eventually. This is a non-standard scale size figure. So Roxas will stand at just about seven inches tall (18cm). It is a static one with no additional parts or poses. He’s wearing his day-to-day clothing like he did in The Other Twilight Town and wielding a keyblade. On the base, the top of the Organization XIII logo appears in blue. Here are the first photos Square Enix shared of the figure.

2025-12-16T14:01:12,Aaero2: Black Razor Edition – how PSP and Guitar Hero led to this rhythm-action game,"Let me tell you how a PlayStation in a Welsh recording studio sparked a three-decade journey into the rhythm-action genre. This is the birth of our game, Aaero2: Black Razor Edition , which is available now on PS5.. As the 90s came to an end, my band had just signed our first record deal and we were living at a recording studio in Wales, recording our first EP. One evening, with my guitar parts, the bass and drums already in the bag, the drummer and I noticed a PlayStation under the TV in the lounge. There were two games; Colin McRae Rally and PaRappa the Rapper. We played a lot of Colin McRae before deciding to give the other odd-looking game a go. That’s where it all started for me and rhythm games. I’ve been obsessed with video games since I was little. The revelation that playing music and playing video games had a crossover point was huge. Play  Video Entering the games industry After relentless hustling and following the least orthodox route imaginable (Musician > Engraver > Tattoo Artist > Architectural 3D Artist > Video Game Artist) I landed my first game job as an environment artist at Codemasters. It was at Codemasters – the home of Colin McRae Rally – that I first worked with Dan. A brilliant programmer and I’m struggling to find the right words. Let’s go with ‘enigmatic eccentric’. The PlayStation 2 was brand new and the bleeding edge of gaming. It was such an exciting time to be making games. B-Boy, PSP, and the music/game connection In 2002, a group of six guys broke away from Codemasters and Rare to form a new studio called FreeStyleGames. They were working on an exclusive game for PlayStation 2 and PSP called B-Boy. The connection of music and gaming was irresistible. Dan and I migrated over. In addition to art, the B-Boy project and smaller team structure allowed me to get involved in the music/audio side of things as well as game design. Guitar Hero and the golden age of rhythm gaming Keeping with the Hip Hop vibe, we went on to make a DJ game which caught the attention of Activision and became DJ Hero. They asked if we could help make content for Guitar Hero. Yes. Yes I can! I hired a team of absolutely incredible musicians and designers. Some musicians at the time scoffed at Guitar Hero and suggested people should play a real guitar instead of wasting time on games, but we disagreed. It was introducing people to music they otherwise may not hear and letting them appreciate it on a whole new level. The birth of Mad Fellows and Aaero Dan and I left FreeStyleGames in 2013 to form Mad Fellows. While people often mention Rez when describing Aaero, and it was indeed one of my favourite games, it wasn’t the biggest influence. It was actually most inspired by Gitaroo Man. The use of analog sticks to trace the music comes from my love for iNIS’ timeless classic. I still keep my PSP to hand so I can have a blast through the songs every now and then. Meeting Wired Productions While showing an early version of Aaero in 2015 at EGX in London, we first met the guys from Wired Productions. As a massive fan of Arcade Paradise, I had been talking to Leo (Managing Director of Wired Productions and co-founder of Black Razor Records) about how much I loved the soundtrack. The authentic 90s tracks really captured the vibe of the era, and the opportunity to bring this music into Aaero2 as the Arcade Paradise Music Pack was a dream come true. The Lania Kea Music Pack just naturally flowed on from that, and at that point we realised Aaero2 had evolved into something new. Full circle Aaero2: Black Razor Edition represents the culmination of many years of experience in music games from both Mad Fellows and Wired Productions. Its release on PlayStation feels like a huge milestone in a three-decade-long personal journey as a gamer and game developer. Aaero2: Black Razor Edition Is out now on PS5.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.597282,Paul Norris,PlayStation.Blog,https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/16/aaero2-black-razor-edition-how-psp-and-guitar-hero-led-to-this-rhythm-action-game/,c9f7f486964bf82232f8d46b61141e83e8b1c976,277,en,0.1,"Let me tell you how a PlayStation in a Welsh recording studio sparked a three-decade journey into the rhythm-action genre.

2025-12-15T15:00:09,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 drops a free story and content update on Dec 18,"Update (Dec 16, 2026): Hey guys, the author of the article on the line. Due to the last-minute complications, we have to delay the Stories Untold update by a couple of days. You can expect it to release on December 18. We appreciate your patience and are also sorry for possible frustration. It will be worth it, though — we promise! On December 16 we will release a content update for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with a brand new storyline which will bring: 8 quests that can take hours to complete 7 locations to explore 6 characters with their own backgrounds and stories A unique weapon A hub to create All of this — completely free for all owners of the game. Christmas arrived earlier in the Zone. Let’s get into it. What’s S.T.A.L.K.E.R. all about? S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl gives you a chance to jump into the Chornobyl Anomalous Zone. A place frozen in time since 1986, but re-emerged after the second explosion caused by secret scientific experiments. It is an abandoned area, surrounded by a massive perimeter wall to protect the outside world from what was left inside after horrific experiments. Now, this place is full of mysteries, buried secrets, horrific mutants, anomalies, artifacts, and… people. Play  Video Those are called stalkers. Caring only about themselves or their close group. Each and every one with the intention to get something from the Zone — money, fame, answers to the deepest personal questions and God knows what else. You are one of them. So what is this new quest? Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map. The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations. Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong. You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is. Never forget about your gear No stalker embarks on an expedition unprepared. That’s where the new weapon comes in handy. The GP37V2 is a modified version of the GP37 rifle, crafted for the most tactically proficient players. It features a pre-installed suppressor and a low-magnification scope. The trigger group has been modified to support single and burst fire modes only. The cost of failure is higher, but in the hands of a skillful operator, the GP37V2 can reward you with its precision and power. And even if that somehow doesn’t sound like the best fit for your playstyle — you still have 30+ weapons (plus attachments) in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 to choose your favorite from. New locations and places As a bounty hunter, you need to explore, loot, and survive. Believe us when we say that the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine in Red Forest are worth your time. If you have already travelled the Zone south-to-north and east-to-west, you’ll see some familiar locations are now re-inhabited by stalkers. The story will lead you through Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot near Malachite, and Volkhov SAM. Your choices may also lead you to completely uncharted places. Trust your instincts to see how it pays off. New hub in the Burnt Forest region Your choice matters in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 — and it literally shapes and changes the Zone. It stays true in this new story, as one of the outcomes is a whole new hub appearing in a not-so-populated area of Burnt Forest. Technician, trader, medic, guide — everyone will be there. Of course, including a place to take a nap, and your stash! Jump into the story This is a content update for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl that will be available to all play on December 16, 2025. Grab your permit to enter the Zone and dive into the massive open world, full of mysteries, secrets, and dangers unknown to humanity. Take your time in this big and atmospheric adventure, lose yourself in the ultra-realistic, stunning and haunting Zone — created with photogrammetry to serve as a digital museum of a real place. DualSense features, 3D Tempest Audio, haptics and gyro aiming — available exclusively on PlayStation 5 — will complement the extreme immersion of this atmospheric dive into the unknown.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.599265,Mykyta Horodyvskyi,PlayStation.Blog,https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/,99eddc771753d307bc911978468055fe817b70ec,278,en,0.1,"Update (Dec 16, 2026): Hey guys, the author of the article on the line.

2025-12-12T04:09:13,"New Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 content available today, including Verso’s Drafts level","Speaking for everyone involved in the development and release of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 , we want to thank you, every single one of the fans, for what an unimaginable year of success our game has had in 2025. As a show of thanks, we’re dropping a major content update to the game on PS5 right now (for free!). The largest inclusion here is a brand-new level, “Verso’s Drafts”, featuring new environments to explore, battles to fight, and plenty of surprises to discover. The biome has a very childlike, wonderland-style aesthetic, inspired by Verso’s childhood, but you’ll see more cutscenes that elaborate on this in the update. It goes without saying that Lorien Testard’s musical magic is back too, with new tracks added for the level. “I lived the creation of the last songs of the OST as a farewell to this whole adventure and to the characters who have accompanied my life and imagination for five years. I’m happy to know that today it was just a goodbye… We had the chance to compose music for a very special level, a deep and playful part of Verso’s childhood. Who would have thought he loved sweets so much when he was younger? “It gave us the opportunity to have a lot of fun, to dance and to laugh while creating these songs; you can even hear Alice’s natural laughter in one of them! And then the time came to write the last track of the album… once again, the time to say goodbye. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring, if it will be clair or obscur, but I know it’s within that in-between that dreams blossom. Thank you for dreaming with us.” – Lorien Testard, Composer, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Take a look at the Thank You Update Trailer, featuring Verso’s Draft here: Play  Video You’ll find a plethora of unlockables in Verso’s Drafts too. There’s 13 new weapons to unlock, some having a similar vibe to the child-like environments in the level (candy scythe, anyone?). 16 additional Luminas are also available to unlock – adding even more customization and options to your combat. There’s also a bunch more costumes and hairstyles for each character, some look very chic, and some… intentionally goofy – I won’t spoil it here, but you might want to try the running animation in some of them. Fans will be delighted to know, after many many requests, that we finally added a photo mode in the game! Not to brag, but it’s a pretty in depth one too you can add filters (33, to be exact) and effects, change the angles, field of view, color grading, and even change the location and colors of the lighting (with 10 fully customizable lights!). Our Senior Gameplay Programmer, Florien Torres, shares his insight: “You will be able to use this during cinematics, which we expect people will get very creative with. With the photo mode camera, you can travel an infinite distance without collision – basically, the team wanted to go all in and give full access to the player, meaning they could access weird locations, even below the map and sort of ‘backstage’.” We’re extremely excited to offer this to our fans and see what masterpieces they will create with these new tools. This isn’t everything of course, there’s many QoL features added that players will appreciate, including adding filters when searching for Lumina’s, being able to save preset Lumina loadouts, and having the option to abandon battles (if you want, no judgement here). We’ve also added more text language support, so the game is more accessible, the new language additions include: Czech, Ukrainian, Mexican Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more planned for the future. You might also catch at the very end of the trailer; an extra challenging surprise awaits! And it won’t be the only challenge for players to overcome – you can expect to find a slew of new boss battles for late-game players within the Endless Tower. Parrying your way up the tower will reward players with all new Pictos, costumes, and a bunch of other gear. We can’t express our gratitude enough, but we hope this update helps express it in some way. Fans can play Verso’s Drafts as part of the new Thank You Update available now on PlayStation 5!",2025-12-17T11:45:53.607202,Guillaume Broche,PlayStation.Blog,https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/new-clair-obscur-expedition-33-content-available-today-including-versos-drafts-level/,709ada002e66a10cd3f7fb9269c60b7402de8bdf,280,en,0.1,"Speaking for everyone involved in the development and release of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 , we want to thank you, every single one of the fans, for what an unimaginable year of ",other,0.25

Gone are the technologically simplified, GPU-agnostic measures employed by previous FSR versions ; Redstone deals exclusively in more sophisticated machine-learning tools that specifically require the latest Radeon graphics hardware to function. The RX 9000 series , to be precise, just like how new DLSS editions always demand the newest, most AI-embracing Nvidia RTX cards. This lack of support for older Radeons is a major strategic shift, but AMD insist that the image quality and stability improvements will be worth it.

2025-12-16T21:30:00,"NBA 2K26 Slam Edition Vs Superstar Edition, Explained","Picking out which edition of NBA 2K26 to buy is a dilemma for a lot of fans. Between the two standout editions that sit above the Standard release, it’s a lot about how much of a head start you want in MyCAREER and MyTEAM. They’re both designed for different player bases, and this guide will help you figure out which one fits your needs best. So here’s all you need to know about the Slam Edition and Superstar Edition of NBA 2K26. What You Get with the Slam Edition The Slam Edition is priced at around ~$80 and hits right in the middle, giving you a bunch of solid, useful bonuses without fully skipping the early grind of NBA 2K26 . Here’s what comes with it: NBA 2K26 base game 35,000 VC MyTEAM Series 1 Full Team Selection Triple Threat Park Free Agent Pack x5 Series 1 MyTEAM Packs 2-Hour 2XP Coin x10 Skill Boosts (6 types, 10 games) x10 Gatorade Boosts (3 types, 10 games) Slam Edition Cover Athlete shirt in-game What Comes With The Superstar Edition On the other hand, the Superstar Edition is priced at ~$100 and is targeted at players who want a real head start in early NBA 2K26 , and likely play competitively in online modes. Superstar Edition includes: NBA 2K26 base game 100,000 VC MyTEAM Series 1 Full Team Selection Triple Threat Park Free Agent Pack x5 Series 1 MyTEAM Packs 2-Hour 2XP Coin x25 Skill Boosts (6 types) x25 Gatorade Boosts (3 types) Shai Gilgeous-Alexander MyCAREER cover jersey The kickstart with VC and consumables alone causes a noticeable difference once you hit The City or Rec. VC And MyCAREER Progression Between the two editions, the differentiator is the amount of VC included. With the Slam Edition, you get 35,000 VC. While these will help you with early progression, they’ll start stretching thin once attribute costs start increasing. You’ll still be grinding games early, especially if you plan to play online. Meanwhile, the Superstar Edition comes with 100,000 VC. Such an amount lets players develop a MyPLAYER into a more competent overall range right away. Not only that, but you can also unlock key animations and significantly reduce the early frustration in Park, Rec, or Pro-Am. The difference is inherently significant for MyCAREER-focused players. Skill Boosts, Gatorade, And Gameplay Impact Image by Operation Sports A chunk of the players often overlook consumables, especially when they’re in the early grind phase. Truth be told, they matter way more than you would think. With the Slam Edition’s 10 Skill and Gatorade boosts, you basically have a safety net for all those early games you might have struggled with otherwise. With the Superstar Edition, you get 25 boosts. That’s not just a quick short-term fix; you can look to sustain performance across multiple sessions. For guards in particular, those extra Gatorade boosts help with stamina management. Plus, the shooting and playmaking boosts can make those early online wins become more consistent. Which Edition Should You Buy? When you put both editions side by side for MyTEAM, they’re nearly identical on paper. Both editions include a full Series 1 team pick, a Triple Threat Park Free Agent card, five Series 1 packs, and a 2-hour XP coin. However, the Superstar Edition really stands out with flexibility. That extra VC can be spent right away for extra packs or Auction House moves. In those first few weeks, having those options can make a real difference. Slam Edition works best for casual players, or if you just want some extra bonuses like VC and packs without going all-in. It’s perfect for players who take meaning in the grind, building stats and badges at their own pace. On the other hand, if you’re all about MyCAREER or MyTEAM, or you want to get a real head start with more VC and bonuses outright. Superstar Edition is the way to go, especially if you care about online play and want to compete seriously.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.670690,Burair Noor,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/nba-2k26-slam-edition-vs-superstar-edition-explained/,c14fa9eed2fdc56c19ff83125e55f7473bb10e37,387,en,0.1,"Picking out which edition of NBA 2K26 to buy is a dilemma for a lot of fans.

It’s important that a game like WWE 2K25 capture that essence, allowing players the freedom to define their superstar’s legacy, turning their rookie into a legend. Unfortunately, in recent games, WWE 2K ’s career modes have failed to capture this aspect properly. While the game has been polished over the years, improving its mechanics and expanding its roster, its modes limit the potential the wrestling world has due to its boundaries. The issue that WWE 2K has is consistently failing to deliver meaningful player agency, as players’ actions and decisions do not have a significant impact on the storyline or their character’s legacy. Preset Outcomes The career mode in WWE games has always been a linear, cinematic experience. Well, as cinematic as a WWE 2K game can get. We’ve talked about how MyRise needs to improve before, and while 2K25 offers a lot in the way of personality and background customization, it still has areas to work on. Some of the story beats don’t always hit as hard in the latest title, and many thought the storyline was a bit “corny.” But again, while MyRise is a good time in WWE 2K25 , the player agency still isn’t completely there. Even if you want your superstar to be a cold-blooded powerhouse like Brock Lesnar, you’ll still be forced to lose matches that you shouldn’t be losing. You’ll often get humbled, just because the game decides how the story goes. Similarly, it’s off-putting when you’re putting together an honorable superstar, but the game demands you to backstab others or pull cheap moves. It breaks the immersion, especially when it differs so much from your own headcanon. Choices That Don’t Matter To prevent the players from feeling trapped in a script, WWE 2K came out with a half-baked solution: letting players choose between dialogues and minor decisions. Nonetheless, this is just an illusion of choice, as whatever approach you choose, the outcome always boils down to a binary choice. The only effect your decision has is a somewhat different response from the NPC or a short-term cosmetic change to the wrestler’s face. Importantly, the story will stay the same; even if you agree to face an opponent or not, it is necessary to fight them. Basically, any high-stakes decision you make does not alter the storyline. A lack of structural consequence makes the players aware of the importance of their decisions in the story, making them redundant and unwilling to engage anymore. True agency in a role-playing game is the terror that a bad decision could lead to an unwanted outcome, unlocking a completely different story path. Terrible Replay Value The biggest consequence of this suffocating agency and inflexible narrative structure is a negative effect on the mode’s replay value. Why bother playing the MyStory again if that is the only story the game has to tell? Video games that are built upon inviolable agency make the player desire to play the game once more, just to completely change the character’s identity, alignment, and choices. This results in a radically different ending, distinct companions, and several different outcomes. However, in WWE 2K MyCareer, the only things that will change in the second playthrough are your character’s appearance and move-set. Once you know your custom wrestler starts off struggling, and then is forced to make alliances and fight a final boss, this will ruin your role-playing experience. The core idea of the mode is to focus on repetitive grinding for in-game currency and attribute points, rather than allowing you to carve out your own unique legacy. This is the reason why players often prefer the freedom of online play or the universe mode.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.673667,Asad Khan,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/why-wwe-2k-career-modes-struggle-with-player-agency/,9a93fee607a43400a221766a8deb602e22e8d943,388,en,0.1,"What makes a good WWE superstar?

2025-12-16T20:30:00,Maximum Football: First Impressions of Franchise Mode,"Maximum Football has finally dropped its much-awaited Franchise Mode, but the jury still seems to be out on a verdict. While fans have been eagerly trying out all the new features and cosmetics, there are definitely some things holding the game back. Still, even though the game mode isn’t perfect, it has stirred up quite a name for itself in the Maximum Football fan club. Initially off to a rough start, Maximum Football struggled to gain traction and connect with players. However, Franchise Mode is set to change all that. The game-defining update will enable players to blend their Dynasty Mode progress into the pro league seamlessly. It’s time to step up your game and see if you have what it takes to make the cut. Today, I’ll be talking about my first impressions of Maximum Football’s Franchise Mode and whether or not it’s worth it. What Is Franchise Mode? Image: Maximum Entertainment To get a better understanding of my review of Franchise Mode, let’s take a look at what Franchise Mode brings to the table. Released on 9th December 2025, Franchise Mode materialises the concept of taking your college squad to the big leagues. Not only does it aim to give players more creative autonomy, but it can also help transition your Dynasty Mode team into professional play. Seniors from Dynasty Mode will automatically enter the following year’s Franchise draft pool, allowing you to bring them into an NFL team of your choosing. Follow up on your favourite college picks and see how far you can take them with the proper coaching tips and training routines. That’s not all, though. Maximum Football wants to give players full-fledged autonomy. The ability to run leagues as you wish. Your rules, your strategy, and even your ticket prices. I’ll expand on all of this ahead, but this was just to get you started and give you an overview of what Maximum Football’s Franchise Mode is all about. First Impressions Of Franchise Mode Image: Maximum Entertainment You may know what Franchise Mode is, but what features do players have access to in this newly released game mode? I mentioned that there are two selling points for Franchise Mode: the transition from Dynasty Mode to Franchise Mode and the ability to create a league as you see fit. Now, it’s time to break down how Maximum Entertainment has achieved these goals. Pre-League Settings When you start Franchise Mode for the first time, the first screen you will be prompted to is the League Settings menu. Here, you can select league size, number of games per season, number of conferences/divisions/teams, and playoff berths. Next, you have the General Settings, where you have a plethora of settings to choose from, for example, ball type, overtime type, timeouts per half, etc. The final two setting menus include scoring and clock settings, which are really fun to play around with. Now, if you’re a hardcore football fan, this might not seem that attractive. Why would anyone want to change the original rules of the game, right? But for most casual (and some competitive) gamers out there, this is the perfect solution to a monotonous and repetitive game mode. By allowing players to change the core rules of the game , you can now replay the league in different versions. Choose between smaller leagues with professional settings or larger conferences with college-level rules. It is up to you to set the playing field where teams go head-to-head and tough it out to see who comes out on top. Choosing Your Team And Staff The next part of the selection process is picking which team to go with and a staff pairing that complements it. Players have a wide selection of teams to choose from, with budgets mentioned below each team’s banner. However, that’s not all. If you don’t feel like siding with one of the pre-made teams, you can always create your own! Maximum Football allows you to create a Custom Team to play with in the season. While there will be some prerequisites and restrictions, I’m sure a lot of you will love the idea of creating a team of your choice. It’s a similar situation with the staff. While you cannot create your own staff, there’s a list of staff you can hire, from head coaches to accountants. Here, everything is under your control. The one thing you need to bear in mind is that after choosing a team, everything comes out of the team’s budget. And until the season doesn’t starts, you won’t generate revenue. Still, this is an amazing change in Maximum Football . Not only will it keep players engaged with all the decisions, but you also have the power to dictate who stays and who goes. Player Customisations, Coach Challenges, & Revenue Streams The final part I’m covering for Franchise Mode is the player customisations and other smaller decisions. As it says, player customisations are now a thing in Maximum Football , and I’m not just talking about their body dimensions. Welcome to the world of customisations, where you can edit their body size, facial features, mouthguards, tattoos, and more. Coach Challenges are basically side quests you can complete to earn XP. Use this XP to upgrade your coach’s stats. The game features weekly, seasonal, and career challenges, giving you a ton of free XP to get your hands on. Finally, we have ways to make money, and this is quite interesting in my opinion. First of all, you can set ticket prices and upgrade your stadium as you progress. But now, you can even set concession prices at your discretion. Think a hot dog is worth $8? Set the price and see how well it does. The more popular your team is, the more people come to games. The player customisations and revenue streams really make Maximum Football stand out compared to other football games, and might just be what the game needed to get back on track .",2025-12-17T11:45:53.675651,Shahmeer Shahzad,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/maximum-football-first-impressions-of-franchise-mode/,4a9c860c3e6a1727b6d119b5dd257f45e10d8424,389,en,0.1,"Maximum Football has finally dropped its much-awaited Franchise Mode, but the jury still seems to be out on a verdict.

2025-12-16T20:00:00,"NXT Superstars Suggest WWE 2K26 Scan, Raising Questions about Darkstate","Word’s spreading fast across the WWE 2K community: four more NXT star talents confirm they’ve been scanned for WWE 2K26 . Now everyone’s buzzing about whether Darkstate finally makes the roster. Fans are hyped up, but being scanned doesn’t equal making an entry into a 2K installment , as one Reddit user points out: “While chances are good, do remember getting scanned doesn’t equal being confirmed to be part of any given WWE 2K game. We’ve got people scanned in the past who missed one and even two full WWE 2K games before getting added, Alicia Fox, the 4HW and Kelani Jordan comes to my mind as people who got scanned but then missed the following WWE 2K game they were supposedly getting scanned for.” So, in light of this rising debate, let’s dive into what you need to know and what to expect coming up in WWE 2K26 . Darkstate Making The WWE 2K26 Roster? Darkstate is where all the real intrigue is. People keep bringing up their run so far in NXT: tag titles chases, main event angles, and the whole deal as prime 2K26 material. In a game where 2K25’s NXT tag division felt thin in Universe Mode, Darkstate simply makes sense for 2K26 . As one r/WWEGames subreddit user puts it, “ Hoping they bulk up the division; 2K25 tags are stale. ” Recent history fits, guys like Corbin, Indi Hartwell, and Blair Davenport made 2K25 after being scanned, even after they had left NXT. Jazmyn Nyx also admitted she got scanned for 2K25 before her release, so hope’s alive. This all lines up with the usual early scan wave. Earlier threads also confirmed Jazmyn Nyx via Snapchat Q&A’s, and YouTube’s full of rumors about NXT champs and even AAA crossover names like Mr Iguana. Is There Any Official Announcement? There’s no official word from 2K yet, but the scans always start months ahead to handle models, movesets, and CAWs. The pattern’s obvious: NXT’s getting more spotlight this year. Fans want better Universe Mode integration as well, with long-awaited editions and rising talents. Joe Hendry also recently signed with WWE , so maybe he’ll make an appearance. Whether he’s in the base game or as DLC is hard to say for now.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.677138,Burair Noor,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/nxt-superstars-suggest-wwe-2k26-scan-raising-questions-about-darkstate/,9f8110e8fa7f36568233f111e0612f8181d3d966,390,en,0.1,Word’s spreading fast across the WWE 2K community: four more NXT star talents confirm they’ve been scanned for WWE 2K26 .

The patch notes don’t say much at all, mostly “gameplay stability updates”, a fix for VC totals in recaps, some broad tweaks, and supposedly smoother handling in high-action moments. No new features, no big balance changes — just enough information to keep you guessing. Ask the community: they’re left frustrated from the lack of communication, as one r/NBA2k user comments: “ Would be nice if they actually specified what they did. “Minor tweaks” like when apps update and say “squashed bugs!” doesn’t tell us anything” So, here’s a rundown on what’s changed, and what we know so far: Note: Patch v.1.012 has only been rolled out for current-gen consoles (PS5, Xbox Series). As we know so far, previous-gen consoles did not get an update. Crossplay & Matchmaking Issues Image: 2K The update has caused certain crossplay connectivity issues, and it’s not clear if it’s the reason behind these issues. Players report they can’t connect with friends on other platforms. Either the lobbies fail to join, or matchmaking gets stuck searching forever. Reddit r/NBA2k user reports: “ I play on playstation and have people on xbox in my lobbies but I cant invite or join anyone on xbox. This started today and I havs all my crossplay settings on” Some players whine that long-existing matchmaking issues are getting worse, and report solo Rec queues drop to 1v1s or boot entirely when partying up. These issues existed before for players on different platforms, but they seem to be more rampant after the update. Refined Gameplay Not everything’s a blow for the community, though. Players report that the update brought better playability, smoother animations, and tighter on-ball defense . It’s also noticed that body-ups are now better, contracts are slightly better, and overall gameplay is cleaner. Moreover, the dunk meter seems to be going at a reduced speed, with players finding it difficult to adapt quickly. Dev’s haven’t dropped a hotfix yet; however, past patches tend to show they react quickly to online matchmaking issues. In the meantime, people are suggesting workarounds using the squad finder or hopping into Ante Up queues. You’ll have to make do with those for a while, as you wait out for the official patch notes in the mean time. Again 2K should be really clearer on the changes they’re making with each update, but at least it’s not all bad for players.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.678626,Burair Noor,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/nba-2k26-just-got-a-patch-and-no-one-really-knows-what-it-does/,4c7671433af70a178a6bcb5a64f9edd97f8bfc86,391,en,0.1,"NBA 2K26 just dropped patch 1.012 on December 15, and it has genuinely left a chunk of the playerbase feeling lost.

2025-12-16T19:12:25,Three Fields Entertainment Seeks Community Support to Finish Wreckreation,"Three Fields Entertainment is an independent studio that is not doing so well these days. The small studio was formed by the original creators of Burnout, and currently, the studio is at high risk of dissolving after the launch of Wreckreation . In a dramatic plea for community support and as a last-ditch effort, the company is now asking for support on Patreon. Fiona Sperry, CEO of Three Fields, published the following announcement on Patreon : “With Wreckreation, we’ve realised how important it is to take control of our own destiny again. If you’re part of the Wreckreation Discord, you’ve already seen how much we value talking to players, reacting quickly, and improving the game in real time. Even while facing uncertainty, we’ve continued to update Wreckreation at our own cost, because that’s who we are. Our goal now is to secure around six months of runway. That time allows us to deliver the new features you’ve seen, while continuing the steady stream of fixes and improvements we’ve maintained since launch, and to build toward the future games we want to make next.” You can join the company’s Patreon for free just to follow the updates, but if you want to support the developers, there are four tiers: Booster at $2/month, Boost Chainer at $8/month, Point of Impact at $15/month, and X WOW for $25/month. In terms of benefits, you don’t get much other than a mention in the game credits and access to the community, so this really is just about keeping the studio running. An Uncertain Future We have a lot of love for Burnout , so it’s certainly sad to see some of the original creators struggle like this. However, the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment looks adamant to keep the engine running. She describes the Patreon launch as a decision “rooted in belief, not retreat.” The campaign looks to secure six months of funding. Their 10-person development team costs $65,000 a month, so they’re looking to secure nearly $400,000 somehow to keep going. This situation just goes to show how difficult it is for an independent studio these days. For every successful Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong , there are dozens of cases out there not too different from Three Fields. The company now relies on the generosity of the community to bridge the gap between its financial struggles and creative potential. In case you’re not aware of how bad things are, Wreckreation launched to an all-time peak of 199 players on Steam.

2025-12-16T17:57:53,Sloclap Reflects on Rematch’s Rocky First Year and the Reality of Live-Service Football,"When Sloclap revealed Rematch , the studio’s pivot from martial arts to football felt like a genuine curveball. Known for Absolver and Sifu , Slowclap wasn’t exactly the first name that came to mind for a competitive team-based sports game. Still, the gamble paid off quickly. Rematch reached five million players in its first month , firmly establishing itself as one of 2025’s breakout hits. Behind the scenes, however, the studio says the first year has been anything but simple. Speaking to GamesRadar , Sloclap CEO Pierre Tarno described Rematch as “a very strong learning curve,” particularly because it marked the studio’s first attempt at running a live-service, team-based multiplayer game. While Absolver featured PvP elements, Tarno noted that nothing in Sloclap’s past catalog prepared them for the ongoing complexity of maintaining a competitive football experience where every interaction matters. That complexity quickly showed up in development and post-launch support. According to Tarno, even small adjustments to Rematch ‘s physics or movement systems could cause unintended ripple effects. In a game where positioning, timing, and momentum are critical, those side effects were often felt immediately by players and called out just as quickly. Image: Kepler Interactive “I think players are very precise and very demanding,” Tarno said, acknowledging that community feedback has sometimes been intense. Competitive players, in particular, have been quick to highlight issues, whether it’s a tweak to movement or something as granular as volley height impacting high-level play. One of the biggest miscalculations came with crossplay. While multi-platform matchmaking was always part of Rematch ‘s roadmap, Sloclap ultimately launched without it, underestimating how much players now view crossplay as a baseline expectation. It took more than two months for the feature to arrive, a delay Tarno admitted felt like “an eternity for gamers” and drew sharp criticism. Interestingly, Sloclap never envisioned Rematch as a long-term, forever game. The original post-launch plan covered roughly 12 to 18 months, and that roadmap has already changed significantly. As the meta has evolved and player skill levels have risen across the board, the studio has reprioritized features and updates to focus on what Rematch needs now, rather than what was planned on paper. On December 17, Season 2 of Rematch will go live. And hopes are that it will be a success. However, recent happenings have been cause for concern. Despite racking up over 90,000 concurrent players upon launch, Rematch ‘s player count has since dropped dramatically . And despite receiving a Best Sports/Racing Game nomination at this year’s Game Awards, the devs have needed to address several fan concerns head-on . Overall, we here at Operation Sports think Rematch is a very good game with unlimited potential, and we’re rooting for the team at Sloclap to further flesh out the title and make it everything it can be.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.683091,Christian Smith,Operation Sports,https://www.operationsports.com/sloclap-reflects-on-rematchs-rocky-first-year-and-the-reality-of-live-service-football/,aa9c7381d1a49bc0bed29aa91bac9b3246303553,393,en,0.1,"When Sloclap revealed Rematch , the studio’s pivot from martial arts to football felt like a genuine curveball.

This quest is short, straightforward, and mostly about going to the right places in the right order. In this guide, I’ll walk you through every step , show you exactly where to go, and point out a few small tips so you don’t waste time (or lose quest items). Let’s get into it. Enter the Locked Room at Pilgrim’s Peak Here’s a video on where to enter the Locked Room at Pilgrim’s Peak for the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . Once you accept the quest, Apollo will hand you the Blue Gate Communication Tower Key . First things first: put that key in your safe pocket . You really don’t want to lose it mid-raid. Next, queue into the Blue Gate map . From there, head to Pilgrim’s Peak , located in the far northeastern corner of the map . You’ll know you’re in the right spot when you see the tall tower . Enter the building, then turn left and keep moving forward until you reach a locked door . If the door is already open, even better, just walk straight in. Search the Room for Construction Research Here’s a video on where to find the Construction Research Whiteboard while searching the room for the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . Inside the locked room, check the corner of the room for a whiteboard . Interact with it, and this objective is instantly completed. Simple enough, but don’t leave yet, because that whiteboard is important for the next step. Find the Building Pictured on the Whiteboard Here’s a video on how to find the building pictured on the whiteboard for the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . Now things get slightly less obvious. Take a close look at the photo on the whiteboard . The image points you toward a location near the abandoned housing area shown on the map. Head to that area, and once you’re close enough to the correct building, the objective will complete automatically , no extra interaction needed. Photograph the Abandoned Housing Project Here’s a video on how to photograph the Abandoned Housing Project to complete the Groundbreaking Quest in ARC Raiders . For the final step, you’ll need to take a photo , but not just anywhere. Nearby, you’ll find a specific rock with an interaction circle . Stand on or near that rock, interact with the prompt, and your character will take the photo. Once the picture is taken, that’s it, you’ve officially completed the Groundbreaking quest . Wrap-Up And that’s the ARC Raiders Groundbreaking quest from start to finish. It’s a quick, no-nonsense mission as long as you know where to go, and now you do. If you’re chaining quests or working toward unlocking more cosmetics and gear, this one’s an easy win. Grab your rewards, move on to the next objective, and keep raiding. Up next, I recommend that you also check out my complete guide for the Cold Snap event in Arc Raiders.

2025-12-17T08:07:28,ARC Raiders: Cold Snap Event Guide | How Frostbite Works,"The Cold Snap winter event is officially live in ARC Raiders , and in this guide, I’ll break down everything you need to know , from playing on snow maps, surviving frostbite, completing the Flickering Flames event, finding Candleberries, and unlocking new outfits and rewards. How to Play on a Snow Map To play on a snow-covered map, keep in mind that not every map will have snow active at the same time . The Cold Snap event rotates between maps, so you’ll need to manually select and join the Cold Snap map to experience the winter environment. Once you’re in, the real challenge begins. How Frostbite Works Here’s a video on how Frostbite works on the Cold Snap event of ARC Raiders ! The Cold Snap event introduces a new mechanic called Frostbite . If you stay outdoors for a few minutes , your character will start reacting to the cold. After about a minute, you’ll notice your character shivering , and as time passes, snow will visibly build up on your clothing , a really cool visual detail from Embark that you don’t see in many games. After roughly three minutes outdoors , frostbite kicks in fully and your health will start ticking down slowly . That’s your cue to get indoors immediately . Once you enter a building, the damage stops, and the frostbite effect begins to reverse. If you go back outside too soon, you won’t take damage right away, but the shivering and snow buildup will return, and after a few more minutes, the health drain starts again. Tip: Stay indoors until the snow patches on your character disappear. That’s when it’s safe to head back out. I also tested a few edge cases: Standing near a balcony doesn’t trigger frostbite, the game considers it indoors. Areas like covered parking with open sides still count as outdoors, so frostbite applies there. Flickering Flames Event Explained Next up is the Flickering Flames event . To access it, go to Raider → Projects → Flickering Flames . The event has five stages , and each one requires you to collect specific items like: Empty wine bottles Light bulbs Plastic pots And a unique item called Candleberries Let’s talk about where to find those. Where to Find Candleberries Here’s a video on where to find Candleberries in ARC Raiders for the Flickering Flames Cold Snap Event! Candleberries spawn in areas with dense vegetation . For example, on Barry City , head toward sections of the map with trees, bushes, and plants , especially around the middle areas. Search through bushes carefully, they’re a bit rare, but you’ll eventually find a Candleberry tree you can loot. Once you pick them up, store them in your safe pockets immediately . You really don’t want to lose these. The same rule applies on other maps like The Dam . Anywhere with trees and vegetation is your best bet, just keep checking bushes and you’ll find them eventually. New Outfits & Cosmetics in the Cold Snap Event The Cold Snap event also adds new outfits, items, and emotes . The main highlight is the Warden Outfit . To unlock it, you’ll need to complete the Stench of Corruption quest, which is part of a new chain quest , meaning you’ll need to finish a few prerequisite quests first. Completing the Groundbreaking quest unlocks an alternate color variation of the Warden outfit as well. Wrap-Up And that’s a quick, clean breakdown of the Cold Snap and Flickering Flames events in ARC Raiders . From surviving frostbite to farming Candleberries and unlocking new cosmetics, you’re now fully prepped for the winter grind. Up next, if you still haven’t completed the Paving the Way quest in ARC Raiders , check out our guide. It includes locations, objectives and tips, so you can complete the quest with ease, and you don’t miss out on the rewards!

2025-12-17T04:12:14,ARC Raiders Paving the Way Quest Guide,"Paving the Way is one of the new quests in the Cold Snap update for ARC Raiders. For this quest, Apollo wants you to find data that might be crucial to reinforcing structures. After all, an entire sector collapsed in a fairly unprecedented way… and we don’t really want that happening again, do we? In this quick guide, we’ll tell you how to easily complete this quest to get Apollo his data. Paving the Way Quest Guide This one is a bit unique in that it only tells you to go to “any ENELICA building”, without specifying. An easy one for this quest is the Pipeline Tower in the Dam Battlegrounds map, marked on the map above. Once you reach the Pipeline Tower, you’ll want to take the zipline up. Then, turn to your left to find an interactable notice board. Interact with it to investigate it and you’ll complete the first step of this quest. Again, though, you don’t need to go to this specific building for this quest. Any other ENELICA building will do. But that also means that the location of the notice board will be different for each building! Nonetheless, at least now you know what to look out for. Anyway, with that done, you’ll need to go to the Piazza Roma area in the Buried City map. More specifically, you’ll need to enter the southwestern building there, as shown above. Once you reach the building, you just need to take the stairs up to the rooftop. That should mark the “reach the top floor above the Convinio” objective as completed. After the objective pops as completed, take one flight of stairs down from the rooftop and enter the researcher’s apartment.

2025-12-17T01:05:46,ARC Raiders: Where to Find Candleberries Locations,"If you’re planning to do the Candlelight project in ARC Raiders , you’ll need to learn the locations where you can find Candleberries. Candleberries are a new fruit resource that shows up in Nature areas during Cold Snap events. They are required for the current ongoing Candlelight project, so you’ll need to gather them if you wish to participate. In this quick guide, we’ll tell you where to find these berries easily. Where to Find Candleberries | Locations Guide First of all, you should be aware of what you’re looking for . Candleberries appear as harvestable bushes full of red berries, just like the one shown above. Once you spot it, just approach it and interact to collect the Candleberries. As far as we can tell, Candleberries seem to only spawn while the Cold Snap event is active, as well. Focus on maps that have it active if you wish to get these berries! To find the bushes, you simply need to look in Nature areas. It’s the same as trying to find Lemons , for example. The image above shows the 3 most recommended areas , as they have the highest density of harvestable plants. Do remember, though, it’s all a bit random. Sometimes more bushes spawn than other times, and their locations can vary slightly. So, don’t expect to find Candleberries in the same spots each time. Alternatively, you can also get Candleberries from the Flickering Flames event’s reward track. You get them as every other reward from the event. To be able to claim rewards, you’ll need to collect Merits. To get Merits, you just need to play the game and earn XP. You get 1 Merit for every 100 XP! There are quite a lot of Candleberries in this event’s reward track, so we recommend not ignoring it. In fact, it might be faster to focus on it than trying to harvest them on your own. So, there you have it! That’s the locations for Candleberries in ARC Raiders, so now you know where to look for them. Hoard them for the Candlelight project!

2025-12-16T08:37:45,How to Optimize PC for Gaming,"If you want to get some extra gaming performance out of your PC, there are some things you can do to optimize it. While generally PCs are meant to be good out of the box, there are still things you should do if you want to ensure everything runs smoothly! After all, it’s part of the charm of PCs. In this quick guide, we’ll tell you about the main things you should do first to optimize your PC for gaming. Update Drivers Our first recommendation here is a quick and easy one: update your GPU drivers. GPU drivers often include updates that add support for newer games. That means, extra optimizations that make games run better! Plus, you want to ensure that you have the latest drivers as they contain the latest fixes and whatnot. Here are the support sites for the GPU manufacturers, where you can find the latest drivers from them: NVIDIA AMD Intel This is particularly important for playing newly-released games. So, don’t ignore updating drivers. Enable Game Mode Another simple optimization is to just enable Windows’ game mode. You can find it in the “Game Mode” choice under “Gaming” while in Windows’ Settings. Alternatively, just type “Game Mode” into the search bar. This one’s pretty simple, as all you need to do is just turn it on. Windows will then make sure to prioritize your games over background apps, which should improve performance. Disable Unwanted Startup Apps For this one, first open the Task Manager . You can do so by right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting Task Manager or pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ESC together. In the Task Manager, select the “Startup Apps” tab. This will show you all the programs that start up as soon as you boot up your computer. If there’s something you don’t need or use often in the list, just right-click on it and select to disable it. This will prevent it from running automatically, saving up your PC’s resources for more important things… such as gaming! After you apply the changes you want for this one, we recommend rebooting your PC. Optimize Game Settings This is something that’s going to depend on a game-by-game basis . But, you want to make sure to go into the graphics settings for each new game you get. Out of the box, a lot of games don’t really have the most optimal settings. For example, some games default to the highest settings. Some settings barely have a noticeable impact on visuals, but do lower your performance. That said, this is something you’ll need to research for each game. In many cases, though, you can just find guides by searching up the game’s name and “optimized settings.” We have some of our own, such as our optimized s e ttings for ARC Raiders! Generally speaking, though, it’s just highly recommended to tweak settings for each game to your liking. Aim for a balance that gives you the visuals and performance you want. Try Overclocking This is one that is a bit beyond the scope of this guide, but can really help enthusiasts get an extra push out of their rig. Overclocking is when you modify your CPU and GPU to perform above their default specs. This is generally fairly safe as long as you do it in small increments, but it does require a lot of testing to find a stable setting that works for you. It’s also the kind of thing that is very varied. Different computers have different threshold levels for how much they tolerate overclocking. Even if they have all of the same parts, there’s usually enough variance that means what works for others won’t necessarily work for you! So, this is something that requires a lot of patience and trial-and-error. But it can be pretty rewarding as you get some noticeable performance boosts. If you wish to get started with this, we highly recommend looking up dedicated overclocking resources online. For example, the r/overclocking Wiki works as a beginner’s guide. Again, though, this is a pretty advanced thing. So, do proper research and know that you’re trying this at your own risk. Don’t Trust Scripts and Hacks Blindly Last but not least, we want to simply advise you to be careful with online tools and scripts you find. There are many scripts out there that will claim to “boost your FPs with one click” and things like that. However, in a lot of cases, these same scripts do nothing or change things that can result in system instability. While we can’t in good conscience say that none of them are useful, we simply want you to be careful with what you run on your system. Generally speaking, it’s better to stick to settings you can change normally and only using well-known tools. If nothing else, at least make sure to properly research tools before using them. So, these are our quick tips to help optimize your PC for gaming! We hope this helped at least give you a starting point for your rig.

2025-12-16T05:16:20,How to Fix Stick Drift on PS5 Controller,"Over time, you might notice that your PS5 controller starts having an annoying issue known as stick drift, with no apparent way to fix it. Stick drift is when your controller thinks the stick is being pushed in a direction, even though you’re not even touching it. It usually develops on its own over time, mostly caused by wear, but it’s always annoying! In this article, we’ll go over various potential ways to get rid of this issue. Testing Stick Drift Before we go into the potential fixes, we want to recommend plugging your PS5 controller into a PC and visiting the Gamepad Tester website. This handy website will make it easier for you to see how much stick drift your controller has. Just plug it in and open the website on your PC! You should see something like the example above . As you can see, the left stick on the controller has drift and is pushing down and to the left in neutral. Now, this is by no means a mandatory step or anything. Nonetheless, it does help give you a clearer visual of what’s going on with your controller. But, that said, let’s now go over the fixes. Potential PS5 Controller Stick Drift Fixes Rotate the Sticks The first potential fix is a simple one. Just put your thumbs over both of the controllers’ sticks and slowly do a full rotation in one direction. Do at least 3 rotations in one direction, then stop and rotate in the opposite direction. Remember to do it relatively slowly as well, no need to do it too fast or anything. After that, repeat the rotations while pushing the sticks down to press L3 and R3. Do 3 full rotations in both directions while holding the sticks down and you’re done! This should help dislodge any dust or other debris that might have gotten under the sticks. Plus, it’s a fairly easy method that might fix or alleviate light stick drift. So, it’s a good one to try first of all. Do note, though, this is a temporary fix in most cases. You might need to repeat the process later, but it shouldn’t be a huge deal in most cases. Blow the Stick Another potential fix is to just try blowing into it. For this, just lightly pull the stick up and then blow some air into it with your mouth. While doing this, we also recommend blowing in different spots of the stick. It’s as simple as that! Like the previous method, this mostly works in cases where the drifting is caused by debris. Plus, it’s also a very simple and quick method to try out, so it doesn’t hurt. Reset the Controller For this fix, you’ll need some small and pointy. A toothpick or small screwdriver, for example, might just do the trick. We advise against using anything too sharp, though! Your goal here is to press the button hidden inside the tiny circle on the back of the DualSense controller, as shown above. Press and hold the button for a few seconds while your controller is on and it will shut down. Make sure not to touch the sticks or other buttons at all while doing this, just in case. This will factory reset the controller. Do note that this means that you will need to sync it up with your PS5 again, but that’s about the only downside to this method. This method mostly works in cases where the stick drift is caused by some weird software issues. The controller will recalibrate upon turning back on, so it might just fix things for you. Use a Recalibration Tool First of all, a disclaimer for this method: try this at your own risk. This method can modify the controller’s software, which has the potential to “brick” the controller if misused. Make sure to carefully read the instructions on the website. Again, understand that you’re doing this at your own risk. With all of that said, you will need to plug your DualSense controller into a PC and visit the DualShock Calibration GUI website. Yes, it says “DualShock”, but it supports DualSense too! Then click on “Calibrate Stick Center” and follow the instructions on the website. It’ll help you recalibrate your controller’s sticks, potentially eliminating any software-based causes of stick drift. Again, though, remember that this method is at your own risk. Neither we nor the tool’s developers are responsible if this causes issues for your controller. Be careful and treat it as an advanced method. Closing Words If none of these potential fixes worked for you, it’s likely your DualSense has a more severe case of stick drift. I t might be due to worn sticks and components on the controller, for example. In such cases, we would recommend trying to get in touch with PlayStation support if possible. They might be able to fix it for your controller or get you a replacement. We highly recommend doing this if your controller is still within warranty. Alternatively, you can open up the controller and replace its sticks with new ones. However, this is extremely advanced and outside of the scope of this guide. You’ll need to have a good handle at operating on electronics, desoldering, and soldering. Plus, you’ll need to buy the replacement sticks online. This will also void your warranty, if it’s still active. Regardless, it’s a potential solution as a last resort! We hope this helped you fix the stick drift on your PS5 DualSense controller.

2025-12-16T02:59:18,What is a Good Upload/Download Speed for Gaming,"If you’ve been wondering what a good upload and download speed to have for gaming is, we don’t blame you. After all, proper internet for gaming is not quite the same as proper internet for streaming services! But, there are even more factors to consider beyond just pure internet speed when it comes to gaming, too. In this article, we’ll go over what to look for when it comes to your internet and gaming. Best Upload and Download Speed for Gaming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on Steam Realistically speaking, your internet’s upload and download speeds don’t matter too much for the purpose of online gaming. That might sound crazy, but there’s a reason for it! Most online games do not actually transmit much data, either uploading or downloading. So, even an internet connection as slow as 10mbps would work for online gaming. Of course, there are some games that are exceptions to this rule. Games such as the Call of Duty series, for example, stream game assets in real-time. In those cases, having a faster connection is better. Otherwise, you might get jitter and lag spikes, as we’ve covered before for Black Ops 7. That said, video game file sizes have become quite big in the past few years. So, a faster internet connection is recommended even if you don’t plan on playing online, just so you can download games and updates faster. At a minimum, we would recommend 100mbps download or higher for general gaming. Upload is less important, with 5mbps being good enough in general. That is, as long as you don’t plan on streaming your gameplay or anything of the sort. But, again, speed isn’t the only thing to keep in mind if you do plan on playing games online! More Than Just Speed Waveform’s bufferbloat test There are many other factors that are more important for a smooth online gaming experience than raw speed. For example, consider your distance to the game’s servers and/or other players. The further away you are, the higher the ping will be, creating lag. This varies per game, as some rely on servers while others are purely peer-to-peer for networking. Also, it’s recommended to use a wired connection using an Ethernet cable. A wireless Wi-Fi connection is less stable and can cause lag spikes, particularly in more demanding games such as fighting games. Similarly, bufferbloat can be an issue. This is, in short, latency caused by your router poorly managing your connection’s bandwidth. We’ll let the experts at Bufferbloat.com go into more detail. If you’re sharing your connection with others in your household, we’ll also recommend going for higher-speed internet. This should alleviate issues like the aforementioned bufferbloat. On that note, it’s also a good idea to pause or limit active downloads if you’re gaming. For example, Steam on PC can easily consume all of your bandwidth when downloading games. This can cause lag if you’re playing online. Sometimes, there are also things simply out of your control. There could be issues your internet service provider’s end, for example. If there’s nothing you can do to improve your connection, consider getting in touch with your ISP’s support. Conclusion Speedtest by Ookla To summarize, a download and upload speed as low as 10mbps is enough for online gaming. That’s because raw speed isn’t the most important thing for reducing latency. The other factors mentioned in the previous section are more important for smooth online gaming . If nothing else, at least make sure to use a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi. On the other hand, we recommend a base minimum of 100mbps download speed for gaming in general. Video games are big downloads, so you want high download speeds to download and update them in a timely manner. This varies depending on games, but some modern AAA releases are around 100 GB and even higher. For reference, 100 GB would take around 2 hours and 15 minutes to download at a 100mbps download speed. Assuming the connection stays at a full 100mbps download at all times, of course, which isn’t always the case. So, there you have it! We hope this helped you decide what’s a good upload and download internet speed for you to get for the purpose of gaming!

Titled “ Stories Untold ,” the upcoming update will have you investigate a mysterious radio signal, which will take you across 7 new locations and 8 new quests that will take several hours to complete. Not only that, but it also features 6 new characters, a new hub area in the Burnt Forest , and a new unique weapon in the form of a suppressed rifle. GSC Game World, the developer behind the game, stresses that the story will take “ hours to complete .” As the protagonist, you’ll be tasked with investigating an area near the Malachite on the western side of the map. You’ll be accompanied by Banzai, a radio enthusiast, and that’s where things start to go wrong. In the new story update, you’ll have to pay attention to the Red Forest Region . From there, you’ll then rely on your intuition and knowledge to uncover the mystery behind the signal. Source: Steam Upcoming “Stories Untold” Update for STALKER 2 Releases for Free Aside from the story that will take several hours to complete, you’ll also get a new suppressed rifle called the GP37V2 rifle . The developers emphasized that the gun’s uber-tactical nature means it’s the perfect gun for the most tactical of tacticians. Of course, if you’re not that much of a tactician yourself, you can just bring your trusted old gun with you. If you have already explored the entirety of the Zone , you’ll now notice familiar locations re-inhabited by stalkers . As you progress through the new story, you’ll come across different locations, including the Army Warehouses, Car Dump, and Volkhov SAM, to name a few. Who knows? You might even get to completely uncharted territory. The rest is up to you! Source: PlayStation Lastly, there’s the new hub in the Burnt Forest area. However, since your choices will shape the zone, whether or not you get access to the new spot will depend on you . If you manage to access the new area, then expect everyone to be there, be it a trader, guide, medic, or technician. The update also comes with a bunch of quality-of-life improvements that will make adventuring throughout the Zone both easier and harder. Unfortunately, Stalker 2 left Xbox Game Pass not long ago after it’s been in the service for a year.

2025-12-16T23:45:00,Google is adding a new Phone app feature that could make you answer calls you’d normally ignore,"Google is rolling out a new feature called “Expressive Calling” to beta users of the Phone by Google app. This feature lets callers mark their calls as urgent, which could change how people use Do Not Disturb mode. It makes it easier to figure out if an incoming call is worth answering or not. If you’ve ever ignored a call and later found out it was an emergency from an unknown number, this feature might help. The idea is simple. According to Android Police , when someone makes a call, the app asks if the reason is urgent. If they say yes, the person receiving the call sees a large “It’s urgent!” message with a red siren emoji. This clear warning means users won’t have to guess whether the caller is a telemarketer or someone who actually needs help right away. Depending on the phone’s settings, urgent calls can either ring loudly through Do Not Disturb or show up quietly but still marked as important. Even if someone misses the call, the urgent label stays in the call log. This feature solves a major problem with contact exceptions The system fixes a big issue with how Do Not Disturb exceptions work. Normally, you need to add specific contacts to your exception list if you want them to reach you during DND. That works fine for family, but what if a doctor or school calls from a random number during an emergency? You’d probably miss it. Expressive Calling removes that worry since anyone can mark their call as urgent without being on your contact list. However, there’s a clear risk of people abusing this feature. Everyone thinks their own call is important, so some users might constantly mark normal calls as urgent. If too many people flag everything as urgent, the whole system becomes useless. This is probably why Google is keeping Expressive Calling in testing for now. Google has been working on how its systems understand user needs in recent updates. Now, urgent Calls can override DND with Google's new feature Google is rolling out new features in the Phone and Gemini apps to enhance communication using AI, starting with Expressive Calling.

The feature is rolling out now, but it only works if both the caller and receiver have it enabled. If you’re already in the beta, check for access by opening Phone settings, then General, then Expressive Calling.

2025-12-16T23:30:00,"Your bathroom habits are now being harvested to train artificial intelligence, and the company is trying to dodge responsibility with a bizarre explanation","Kohler is currently under fire because a researcher discovered that the company’s $600 smart toilet attachment records sensitive data about your bathroom habits and uses it to train AI models, as per Techdirt . This is an entirely predictable step in the ongoing “enshittification” era, where corporations constantly push the limits of mass commercial surveillance to turn a profit. If you’re wondering exactly what sort of data a toilet is collecting, this story centers around the Kohler Dekoda attachment. This device uses optical sensors and validated machine-learning algorithms to supposedly deliver “valuable insights into your health and wellness.” In plain English, it tracks how often you answer nature’s call. When you’re dealing with sensitive health information like this, you’d absolutely expect top-tier security, unlike the case in South Korea, where camera footage from inside a gynaecologist’s clinic got leaked . Kohler claimed this data on your bathroom habits was “end-to-end encrypted.” However, a security researcher named Simon Fondrie-Teitler found that the description wasn’t exactly accurate. This sheds light on both enshittification and the move to a mass commercial surveillance dystopia True end-to-end encryption (E2EE) is supposed to secure transmitted data so only the sender and the intended recipient can read it. Crucially, it should prevent the developer and the host company from accessing the raw data. Fondrie-Teitler initially thought Kohler might have implemented a related method called “client-side encryption,” which would allow data to be backed up or synced without the developer accessing it. But the company clarified that the “other end” that can decrypt the data is Kohler itself. Fondrie-Teitler confirmed the situation after exchanging emails with Kohler’s privacy contact. The company stated that user data is encrypted at rest when it is stored on the phone and the toilet attachment, and also on their systems. They clarified, “Data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.” Literal Enshittification: ‘Smart’ Toilets Play Fast And Loose With Your Pooping Data #Technology #ConsumerTechnology #SmartHomeDevices #SmartHome #DataPrivacy #ConsumerTech https://t.co/lClaNM7hVT — Pure Tech News (@Pur3Tech) December 15, 2025 This means that while the data is encrypted during transmission, Kohler has the keys to unlock it once it reaches their servers. This is not E2EE in the way most consumers understand it. The researcher also found that the company is quite open about its intentions for this sensitive information. Responses from the company make it clear that “the data collected by the device and app may be used to train AI models.” This is the real kicker. Kohler isn’t satisfied with the $600 you paid for the hardware; they want to get in on the cash flow generated by selling your data. And this toilet data is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Your electrical meter, your phone, your ISP, and even your automaker are already spying on your every movement and choice. For example, automakers spy on your driving habits, often without telling you, just so they can sell that information to insurance companies that then raise your rates. When companies get caught doing things like this, they often try to dodge responsibility by insisting the data is “anonymized.” That term has always been gibberish, though. Here in the States, this lack of corporate oversight and corrupt inability to pass even basic internet privacy protections means you can expect this behavior to only get worse from here.

2025-12-16T23:15:00,Google is quietly killing a major security feature that millions of users relied on,"Google is removing the dark web report feature that millions of people used to check if their personal information was leaked online. This is a major change because the service was available to anyone with a Google account. If you use this tool right now, you need to know it won’t be around much longer. According to Android Police , Google will stop checking for new data breaches on January 15, 2026. After that, on February 16, 2026, you won’t be able to see any dark web reports at all. If you want one final check, you need to do it before these dates. Google says they’re shutting down the service because the reports weren’t useful enough. People complained that the feature didn’t tell them what to do after finding out their information was exposed. Learning your data is leaked is scary, but without clear steps to fix the problem, the report just creates panic without offering real help. The company is shifting focus to more practical security tools instead Google isn’t giving up on security completely. They plan to work on other security features that give users clear actions they can take to protect themselves. This change might bring better and more helpful security options to Google accounts in the future. The dark web report wasn’t always free for everyone. It started as a paid feature for Google One subscribers only. Later, Google opened it up to all users, which helped millions of people learn about potential data leaks they wouldn’t have discovered otherwise.

While Google continues to expand its AI capabilities significantly , security features like the dark web report are being phased out. Most people don’t need to do anything before the shutdown. The reports will stop updating in January, and Google will delete all the data in February. However, if you want to remove your data right now, you can delete your monitoring profile yourself.

2025-12-16T23:00:00,"Tesla just declared war on Waymo by removing safety monitors, but the company is refusing to hand over the most critical piece of data","Tesla is finally making good on its promise, as several vehicles were spotted driving autonomously without human safety monitors on public roads in Austin over the weekend, as reported by The Verge . This is a massive, aggressive step that feels like the company is declaring war on competitor Waymo by removing what was long considered a crucial safety net. For months, the company’s robotaxis had human safety monitors on board. In Austin, that monitor sat in the passenger seat, and in San Francisco, they were actually in the driver seat. Critically, those humans had access to a kill switch just in case the technology went haywire, a fallback that Waymo, which also came under scrutiny for safety , currently doesn’t need for its established commercial robotaxi service. Tesla service is not fully open to the public yet, relying instead on customer waitlists to manage access. It looks like the company is following through on what Musk said earlier this year. He insisted that those human monitors were only there because Tesla was being “paranoid about safety,” and not because the technology had any real deficiencies. He even predicted that the company would remove the safety monitors by the end of 2025, a deadline he now appears to be hitting. While the move instills some confidence in the tech, Tesla’s refusal to come out with verifiable safety data leaves a lot of doubts The move was confirmed after videos of two separate robotaxis driving totally empty in the front seats were posted to X. Musk later personally confirmed that the unsupervised autonomous testing had officially started in Austin. While Tesla is clearly making progress on fulfilling promises of unsupervised driving before the end of the year, there’s a huge problem that should make you pause. The company has yet to release any comprehensive safety data that compares its technology to human driving benchmarks. We can’t assess or compare the performance of this technology when they keep all that information locked up, which is awful for consumer trust and public acceptance. Tesla robotaxis spotted on public roads without safety monitors https://t.co/2mog1uJs5k — The Verge (@verge) December 15, 2025 Sure, there has been a plethora of anecdotal evidence floating around, mostly from pro-Tesla influencers who have been using the service. But let’s be real, that falls far short of comprehensive, verifiable data that the public and regulators can actually trust. Furthermore, Tesla has yet to put any paying customers in one of these unsupervised vehicles. The reason Tesla is pushing so hard now is that Alphabet-owned Waymo is widening its competitive lead significantly. Waymo has reported over 14 million paid rides in 2025 alone, and they’re planning to expand their commercial robotaxi service to 20 new cities in the coming year. When you look at those numbers, it’s clear Waymo is far ahead in terms of actual commercial deployment despite some embarrassing incidents with their robotaxis . Despite Waymo’s verifiable success, Musk continues to insist that Tesla holds the advantage. He argues that Tesla’s massive customer fleet, which he claims will soon become fully autonomous, is the key differentiator. This sounds great on paper, but you’re forgetting one crucial reality. Most of the Teslas currently on the road actually lack the necessary hardware to support fully autonomous driving.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.724259,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/tesla-just-declared-war-on-waymo-by-removing-safety-monitors-but-the-company-is-refusing-to-hand-over-the-most-critical-piece-of-data/,c5476abafa6ec181cff078e06a32d947af526c5d,405,en,0.1,"Tesla is finally making good on its promise, as several vehicles were spotted driving autonomously without human safety monitors on public roads in Austin over the weekend, as repo",other,0.25

The video shows her opening a can of Great Value sardines, and what she found inside has people talking about shrinkflation. The shopper, Peterra (@peterraaa), believes the store is putting less product in the cans while keeping the same price. According to Bro Bible , when she opened the can, there were only four large sardines floating in a clear, yellowish liquid. She picked one up to show how much empty space was left in the container. The can clearly had room for more fish. Her on-screen text said it perfectly: “Shrinkflation has gotten so crazy you can’t even say ‘packed like sardines’ anymore.” Shrinkflation is when companies reduce the amount of product in a package but keep the price the same. This happens when inflation affects their costs. Instead of raising prices, they quietly give you less product. This keeps customers in the dark about what they’re actually getting for their money. The sardine shortage isn’t just bad luck Walmart’s Great Value Sardines in Water cost just over $1 for about 3.75 ounces. The cans don’t list how many fish should be inside, but Peterra remembers getting more fish before. Many shoppers in the comments agreed with her. One viewer said the cans “Used to be 8 now it’s only 4.” Another person confirmed this, saying it was six sardines for a few months in between. Shrinkflation isn’t just affecting sardines. Shoppers have noticed less product in everything from McDonald’s fries to Ritz crackers, Raising Cane’s chicken fingers, and even Cheesecake Factory cake slices. Many people are now sharing their shrunken purchases on TikTok and calling for boycotts of brands that do this. This isn’t the first time Walmart shoppers have raised concerns about pricing controversies at the retail giant . @peterraaa what is happening ?? shrinkflation is crazy #sardinesfordinner #economy #shrinkflation #groceryprices #inflation ♬ original sound – PETERRA <3 Some commenters offered different explanations. One person suggested that demand went up, but companies aren’t hiring more workers or can’t produce fish fast enough. Another long-time sardine buyer said the cans have been like this for a few years, possibly since the COVID years. One Walmart shopper even checked a can she bought six months ago, and it also had only four sardines. Other shoppers have also exposed how stores use pricing tactics that can cost customers more money.

2025-12-16T22:30:00,"Viral video exposes how McRibs are made, and one microwaved ingredient has customers swearing off the sandwich forever","A video showing the step-by-step assembly of the iconic McRib sandwich has gone viral, causing some customers to swear off the limited-time item completely. This revelation comes just weeks after the sandwich made its highly anticipated return to select McDonald’s locations. If you’re not one of the die-hard fans, you might not realize that the McRib is an intermittent fixture, meaning devotees often wait months or even years for a chance to order it again. The controversial preparation was showcased by TikTok user Antonio Bell, who offered a POV look inside a McDonald’s kitchen and was later covered by BroBible. The part that seems to be turning the most stomachs involves the sauce. The video shows a large vat of barbecue sauce being placed directly into the microwave. Once that’s done, the employee takes the cooked meat pieces and gives them a deep dunk in the microwaved sauce. Before the dunking, the employee starts the process by pulling several frozen “rib patties” out of the freezer. They get placed on the grill and compressed down, then stacked in a plastic container. After the sauce bath, the sauced patties are moved into another plastic tray. Finally, that tray is shoved into a warming rack, ready for employees to put it on buns with onions and pickles. The microwaved sauce process makes the whole operation feel way less gourmet than you might hope for It’s clear that the presentation isn’t exactly top-tier, and some users were quick to express their disgust with the whole operation. One commenter lamented the sensory experience, saying, “The smell of the sauce coming out the microwave is genuinely rancid. Idk how people eat it.” The employee who posted the video wasn’t exactly selling the item either, writing in a comment, “Idk how you guys like these.” However, not everyone thinks the kitchen shown is a complete disaster. Many commenters suggest that while some aspects might look a little unkempt in the video, fast-food chains often maintain surprisingly clean environments due to constant cleaning and nationally dictated standards. You might be surprised to learn that a 2018 study even found that fast-food restaurants were occasionally found to be cleaner than some five-star restaurants. @datboi_bell Enjoy #fyp #mcdonalds #fastfood #life #food ♬ original sound – Antonio Bell Still, cleanliness doesn’t equal health, and if you’re looking at the nutrition facts, this sandwich isn’t exactly a healthy choice. According to the McDonald’s website, the 520-calorie McRib packs 13 grams of sugar and nearly half of your daily recommended intake of saturated fat. This, of course, isn’t as bad as the pure sugar horse treats some viral TikTokers are having , but you should be wary of it just in case. Despite the questionable assembly process and the hefty nutritional stats, the McRib still maintains a fiercely loyal following. Historically, fans were so dedicated that sites popped up just to track which locations had the sandwich available. The item’s limited availability is often speculated to be due to fluctuating pork prices, though others suggest it just isn’t popular enough for a permanent spot.

2025-12-16T22:15:00,"Australian woman finds deadly ‘man killer’ in her bathroom, and the size of it might break a world record","An Australian woman found a huge Eastern Brown Snake in her bathroom recently. The snake was so big that it might actually break a world record. The woman shared videos of the scary encounter on TikTok, and millions of people watched them. Australia is known for having dangerous animals everywhere. The country has 220 types of snakes, and 145 of them are venomous. That means about 65% of all snakes in Australia can poison you. This doesn’t include the scary spiders, jellyfish, and ants that also live there. Most Australians stay pretty calm when they see dangerous animals. According to Bro Bible ,  a TikTok user named @ourcow showed this calmness in videos that got over 9 million views. In the videos, a woman named Bianca talked about finding the giant snake in their bathroom. The snake was massive and extremely dangerous Bianca said they had “Australia’s biggest brown snake” in their bathroom. She guessed the snake was about 6 or 7 feet long and called it a “man killer.” This wasn’t an exaggeration because Eastern Brown Snakes are some of the most venomous snakes in the world. Bianca and her partner wore special boots and jeans to stay safe. She explained that if the snake bit them, they would die. The situation was even scarier because they lived far from help. Their home in the outback was over 60 miles away from the nearest town and hospital. Living in remote Australia comes with unique challenges, much like an Australian couple experienced at a restaurant that caught them off guard. @ourcow Replying to @Scott Seeney What should we do? #brownsnake #farmer #snake #australia ♬ original sound – OUR COW When a snake this deadly bites someone, they can die within minutes. Being so far from medical help made the whole thing much more dangerous. The couple tried to make the snake leave, but it got stuck in the door for a while and kept climbing up the window. Bianca didn’t know how the snake got inside. She thought someone might have left a door open by mistake. Even though the experience was stressful, she stayed calm about it. She simply said it was just “part of living in the bush.” Australians are known for handling unexpected situations with remarkable composure, similar to how a small Australian brand faced Eminem in a legal battle. The snake might have actually broken a world record. The Australian Museum says Eastern Brown Snakes are usually about 5 feet long. The longest one ever officially measured was 6 feet and 7.25 inches.

2025-12-16T22:00:00,"This sugar-free diet snack is secretly a laxative, and one man warns it forces you to ‘play chicken with your own colon’","Type 1 diabetes activist Neil Greathouse is issuing a viral warning about the sugar-free, double-stuffed Oreos, claiming that the tasty snack is actually a secret laxative that forces you to “play chicken with [your] own colon.” This is a terrifying warning, especially for anyone who has relied on sugar-free treats to keep their diet on track. Greathouse, who shared his unfortunate experience via a TikTok video that has racked up over 1.3 million views and was picked up by BroBible , initially loved the taste of the cookies after buying them in Little Rock, Arkansas. He quickly regretted eating five of them, however, when his stomach started growling during a critical Zoom call. He joked that he was trying to save everyone from “the darkest chapter of your gastrointestinal history.” He described the beginning of the disaster as a tiny flutter that hits your abdomen just minutes after consumption. Greathouse said that “12 minutes later, that tiny flutter is going to hit your abdomen, like your colon politely clearing its throat.” That polite clearing quickly escalated into serious, full-blown pain, leaving him fearing that his co-workers could see his distress. He feared he was “one clench away from being a local news headline” while attempting to sit through the virtual meeting. So, why do these sugar-free snacks turn into a digestive nightmare? Greathouse calls out Mondelez International’s Nabisco, the brand behind Oreos, for using a triple threat of ingredients: sorbitol, maltitol, and added fiber. Maltitol and sorbitol are both sugar alcohols that manage to give food a sweet taste without using actual sugar. The issue is that these sugar alcohols are really tough for your body to digest, much like the sugar-free syrups you can get at places like Dunkin’s . According to the Cleveland Clinic, because the body has difficulty breaking down these ingredients, it triggers a reaction where water is sent straight to the colon. That process is exactly what mimics a laxative, causing side effects that include cramping, bloating, and diarrhea. If you’re sensitive to these ingredients, you’re going to have a rough time, and five double-stuffed cookies are clearly way too many. @the.betes If you eat the sugar-free Double Stuf @OREO …your colon will unsubscribe from your body. // Year 33 Day 302 #YourBestT1DYear ♬ som original – Keys Lights Greathouse warns that even though these are sugar alternatives, people with type 1 diabetes should reconsider foods with maltitol. He points out that “Maltitol can still bump your blood sugar up, so yes, your glucose will get a little bit of a rise along with a category five evacuation.” If you’re going to risk the pain, you shouldn’t have to deal with a blood sugar spike too. He offered some solid advice, saying, “My advice is to take a couple units of insulin and eat the real Oreo.” Of course, some viewers saw Greathouse’s warning less as a cautionary tale and more as an opportunity. Some commenters joked about strategically leaving the cookies out in the office kitchen for a coworker they absolutely hate. Others took the opposite approach, seeing the Oreos as a perfect tool for a cleanse. I mean, what’s to expect from the platform where pure sugar horse treats are being gobbled up for virality ? One viewer asked if this means they should eat five sugar-free double-stuffed Oreos if they are constipated and need a cleanse. Another joked they were “clearing my entire weekend, charging my phone to 100%, and doing an Oreo cleanse.” I think I’ll stick to the full-sugar version, thanks.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.735172,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/this-sugar-free-diet-snack-is-secretly-a-laxative-and-one-man-warns-it-forces-you-to-play-chicken-with-your-own-colon/,9aad1c431144ecc0dbe728ab34c59c17af39b037,409,en,0.1,"Type 1 diabetes activist Neil Greathouse is issuing a viral warning about the sugar-free, double-stuffed Oreos, claiming that the tasty snack is actually a secret laxative that for",other,0.25

According to Motor1 , Deziree is a real estate agent and TikTok creator who goes by @saleenbitty351 online. She posted a video on November 12 explaining what happened. She listed her car for sale and a dealership quickly showed interest. They asked for her VIN number, and she sent it to them. But then they came back with bad news about a mileage problem on the Carfax report. Deziree was shocked because she knew this couldn’t be true. Her car was still under warranty and had only been serviced at the official dealership. When she looked at the paperwork the dealer sent her, she found out the real problem. A company called Tire Choice had made the mistake. Tire Choice mixed up her car with someone else’s vehicle Tire Choice had accidentally linked her VIN to a different person’s car when they reported mileage information. This wrong data went into the system that Carfax uses for its reports. The other vehicle had been serviced at that Tire Choice location twice, but Deziree never owned it or went there. This error created a serious problem for her sale. She needed to sell the car, but the Carfax report now showed a mileage discrepancy that made buyers suspicious. She called the Tire Choice store on the report, even though it was two hours away from her home. The person who answered confirmed they had made a mistake with the license plate and VIN. @saleenbitty351 #storytime tires choice messes up  but now I have to waste more time by calling carfaxto have them hopefully remove 2 discrepancies that don’t belong to me. happy #wednesday #cars #fyp ♬ original sound – Dezireesells The employee told her the service records were actually for a guy named Tony. Deziree said her name isn’t Tony, and neither is her husband’s. But the worker told her she would have to call Carfax herself to fix their mistake. She had to clean up someone else’s error that was costing her a sale. This frustrating experience mirrors how companies often make customers prove problems they didn’t create. Mistakes like this happen more often than people think. Other viewers in the comments said oil change and tire shops frequently enter wrong license plates or VINs. One person said their friend who buys and sells cars sees this happen all the time with oil change companies. Facebook Marketplace users should stay alert, especially after other sellers lost thousands to scams on the platform. Some people told Deziree to contact corporate or even get a lawyer to take action against the tire shop. “They used your warranty to repair another car. File a fraud claim,” one person commented. But the main advice was to call Carfax directly. One commenter explained that Carfax requires the owner to verify ownership before they fix any errors. Deziree is now working to resolve the issue.

This whole bizarre incident happened while the coffee chain is facing a massive nationwide Unfair Labor Practices (ULP) strike, and honestly, the CEO’s desperate reaction is seriously telling about the relationship between leadership and staff. The footage was posted over the weekend by the official Starbucks union TikTok account, @sbworkersunited, and was reported by Daily Dot . It shows a woman who identified herself as a 10-year Starbucks barista following a man she believed to be Niccol and his three business-casual companions down a city street. When the barista inquired if the man was indeed Niccol, one of his protectors repeatedly denied it. The barista wasn’t buying the denial, though. She just wanted to introduce herself. She told the group, “I’m a Starbucks barista. I would love to just say hi, if he’s related to it at all.” She added that since she had “been a barista for 10 years,” it would be really nice to meet him. The whole chain of events paints a miserable picture of the Starbucks CEO, unless, of course, he comes out to officially deny that it was not him Instead of stopping, the man who was definitely “just a normal person,” according to his entourage, decided to make a run for it. He walked right out into the street against the pedestrian light, forcing a driver to blast their horn as Niccol and his protectors jogged the rest of the way across the intersection to escape the interaction. Running into traffic to avoid a quick chat? That is awful optics, especially when your company is knee-deep in a labor crisis. The union quickly used the viral video to highlight the ongoing labor dispute. Thousands of Starbucks baristas are currently on ULP strike across the country, protesting the changes Niccol has overseen that they say have made their jobs worse .

The Miami Police Department said an employee at the Little Havana store found the woman’s body when they opened the store at 8:00 AM on Sunday. According to Fox News , police identified the victim as Helen Massiell Garay Sanchez, an anesthesiologist who specialized in congenital heart disease. Officers confirmed she was found inside a walk-in freezer located in the store’s restricted stockroom area, which customers don’t have access to. The circumstances of her death are deeply puzzling. Police scanner reports say Dr. Sanchez was found naked inside the freezer. Dispatchers were heard saying, “Complainant found a naked female in the cooler of the store.” The fact that she was in a restricted area, inside a freezer, and without clothes raises many unanswered questions. Surveillance footage shows no signs of foul play Despite the unusual situation, police say surveillance footage shows no evidence of foul play. Investigators are still trying to understand why Dr. Sanchez went into the restricted stockroom in the first place. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities haven’t explained what the footage actually shows. Dr. Sanchez was originally from Nicaragua and was traveling to the U.S. when she died on December 14, 2025. She leaves behind two children who live in Nicaragua. She worked as an anesthesiologist focusing on congenital heart disease, a specialized and important field of medicine.

This massive financial correction is forcing the Detroit automaker to pivot away from full electrification and focus instead on more efficient gasoline engines and hybrid technology, signaling that the immediate EV takeover dream is officially stalled. The biggest casualty of this strategic shift is the F-150 Lightning. Ford confirmed that it will stop making the all-electric pickup truck entirely, instead opting for an extended-range hybrid version of the vehicle. This is a huge, symbolic move, especially since the Lightning was supposed to be the company’s electric standard-bearer in the crucial truck market. The changes go much deeper than just one model, though. Ford is completely restructuring its key manufacturing future. The Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center, which was supposed to be the beating heart of Ford’s EV and battery production at the BlueOval City campus, is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant. This facility will now produce new, affordable gas-powered trucks instead. Meanwhile, the Ohio Assembly Plant will shift its focus to producing a new gas and hybrid van. CEO Jim Farley tried his best to spin this colossal failure as a positive, customer-driven move Farley said this is a “customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford.” He argued that the “operating reality has changed,” meaning Ford is redeploying capital into “higher-return growth opportunities,” such as its market-leading trucks, vans, and new battery energy storage business. Honestly, calling a $19.5 billion expected loss a “customer-driven shift” is absolutely bizarre. It feels like a desperate attempt to frame a massive financial correction as a strategic decision. So, what’s the new plan? Ford now expects that by 2030, half of its global volume will be hybrids, full EVs, and extended-range EVs. This new goal represents a huge jump from the 17% target the company had this year. It shows that while full electric might be stalled, the market is definitely ready for vehicles that bridge the gap using hybrid and extended-range technology. Ford scraps F150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling consumer interest hits EV plans https://t.co/V7ijNlm68m — The Saratogian (@SaratogianNews) December 16, 2025 Other than the cost factor and the issue with public charging infrastructure, the slow adoption of EVs has been exacerbated by political shifts. President Trump has actively moved U.S. policy away from the aggressive EV targets set previously. Unlike the EU, which has stood strong on its decision to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars , Trump has eliminated EV tax credits and proposed weakening emissions and gas mileage rules. The tariff wars also reportedly played a part in this. Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, pointed out that the cancellation of the electric F-150 Lightning was inevitable because the truck simply wasn’t filling the plant’s capacity. He believes that the combination of slow public EV adoption and the Trump administration’s softer stance on emissions has pushed every automaker to reconsider their immediate direction. Electric vehicles are still the future, Fiorani said, but the transition was always going to take longer than we were promised.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.748066,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/auto/ford-just-took-a-13-billion-blast-as-its-entire-electric-future-crumbles-and-the-ceos-attempt-to-spin-the-failure-is-absolutely-bizarre/,fbebb6b632a19a46ea4c5496f6c40d6e7f922331,413,en,0.1,"Ford Motor Co. is slamming the brakes on its aggressive electric vehicle plans, confirming it has lost a staggering $13 billion on EVs since 2023 and expects to take a total $19.5 ",other,0.25

The post copied a line from the film, saying: “Cc: Democrats. Hate, hate, hate. Double hate. Loathe entirely.” According to Indy 100 , this isn’t the first time the White House has used holiday movies to share political messages. They also posted a version of The Polar Express calling it “The Deportation Express.” Right now, they’re also sharing a “naughty list” of reporters they don’t like. The move to use a children’s movie this way got a lot of negative reactions on social media. People pointed out that using a family-friendly film to push anti-immigrant messages is pretty bad. One user wrote that “Using children’s movies as xenophobic propaganda is disgusting.” Another commenter, PatriotTakes, asked if the post was supposed to be about the “parable of the Good Samaritan.” This bizarre rebrand targets Trump’s most criticized policy area This strange movie rebrand focuses on healthcare, which is an area where President Trump has faced a lot of criticism. People have made fun of him in the past for only offering “concepts of a plan” instead of anything real. He’s mostly spent his time criticizing Obamacare without giving many actual details about his own ideas. President Trump recently talked about his healthcare ideas during an appearance with Laura Ingraham. He made it clear he doesn’t want the current system. He told her: “Call it Trumpcare. Call it whatever you want… Anything but Obamacare!” The administration has been focused on various policy areas, including Trump’s push for unified AI regulations across all states.

But using the Grinch to talk about healthcare policy is definitely getting people’s attention. This unconventional approach mirrors the Cabinet’s surprising TikTok debut that left viewers stunned. It’s a strange moment when beloved holiday movies get mixed with serious policy discussions.

2025-12-16T20:30:00,"Donald Trump declared fentanyl a ‘weapon of mass destruction,’ critics blast him immediately pointing out the one drug dealer he just let walk free","President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction, a massive and unprecedented move that dramatically expands how the U.S. government can fight the synthetic opioid crisis. This isn’t just treating the drug problem as a public health issue anymore; the designation signals that the administration intends to treat fentanyl as a national security threat on the same level as chemical warfare. This classification is a huge shift, empowering the Pentagon to step in and assist law enforcement. It also allows intelligence agencies to deploy tools normally reserved for countering weapons proliferation against drug traffickers. It’s an aggressive escalation designed to ratchet up the assault on what the president calls gangs that are “hell-bent on flooding the U.S. with drugs.” As per CBC , President Trump made the announcement at a White House event honoring service members who police the southern border with Mexico. He was clear about the intent, stating, “We’re formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is.” The executive order itself specified that illicit fentanyl is “closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic.” That’s one way to manufacture an excuse for invading foreign nations This national security crisis is incredibly serious, though. Opioid overdoses have tragically killed at least 68,000 Americans every year since 2020. While Mexico is the largest source of illicit fentanyl bound for the U.S., the fundamental building blocks of the drug mostly come from somewhere else. Policy experts have confirmed that many of the essential chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl are sourced from China. In fact, Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss pointed out that 99 per cent of fentanyl precursors are coming from China, not places like Venezuela. While Venezuela produces some cocaine and acts as a transit point for drugs from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, it isn’t the primary source of the fentanyl precursors wreaking havoc in the U.S. Reminder: Trump pardoned the founder of a black market that imported fentanyl from China into the U.S. So to be clear—he’s fine pardoning criminals who used weapons of mass destruction against the American people. https://t.co/Niw0SATU0r — Rep. Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) December 15, 2025 The WMD designation follows the administration’s earlier move this year to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which has already opened the door to military action . Since early September, the Trump administration has carried out 25 known strikes against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, resulting in the deaths of 95 people. The U.S. military confirmed that it attacked three boats accused of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing eight people across the three vessels. They even posted a video of a boat exploding, though they didn’t publicly provide evidence that the boats were actually carrying drugs. This is where things get sticky. Legal experts are already saying these strikes might be illegal. There has been little to no public proof that the boats carried drugs or that it was necessary to blow them out of the water rather than just stopping them to seize the cargo and question those on board. Democrats and even some Republicans are pushing back , saying the White House needs congressional authorization for these vessel strikes. As you might expect, critics were immediately vocal about the declaration, pointing out a massive contradiction in the administration’s strategy. Democratic House Representative Jim McGovern referenced President Trump’s pardon earlier this year of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road marketplace. Prosecutors alleged that Silk Road was used to sell more than $200 million worth of drugs, and McGovern reminded everyone on social media, “Trump pardoned the founder of a black market that imported fentanyl from China into the U.S.”",2025-12-17T11:45:53.750050,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/donald-trump-declared-fentanyl-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction-critics-blast-him-immediately-pointing-out-the-one-drug-dealer-he-just-let-walk-free/,849ccc35349117bdd1d69c58bd8b5c8aa98355b6,415,en,0.1,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction, a massive and unprecedented move that dramatically expands how the U.S. government",other,0.25
2025-12-16T20:15:00,‘RFK Jr. must go’: Mike Pence breaks with the Trump administration over one issue that won’t go away,"Former Vice President Mike Pence asked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign. The demand came after a major controversy about the department’s safety review of the abortion pill mifepristone. This shows a growing split within the Republican party between strong anti-abortion supporters and the current administration’s efforts to find middle ground on reproductive health issues. Pence’s political group, Advancing American Freedom Foundation, released a harsh memo explaining why Kennedy should step down. They called the HHS secretary a “progressive wolf in pro-life sheep’s clothing.” The organization said clearly that “Republicans gave RFK Jr a chance and he has failed.” The memo criticized Kennedy, saying he was confirmed because people believed he would protect vulnerable women and children, not continue “four more years of progressive pro-abortion policies at HHS.” Pence made a direct statement on Monday, telling President Trump to take action. “Secretary Kennedy should step aside and give President Trump the opportunity to select a new HHS Secretary who will deliver pro-life results for the American people,” the former vice president said, according to HuffPost . The abortion pill review is causing major problems for Trump’s team The main problem is the FDA’s decision in June to do a new safety check on mifepristone. This abortion pill has been on the market for 25 years with a strong safety record. Anti-abortion groups have been pushing the department for months, claiming that mifepristone is dangerous and needs tighter access rules. Kennedy and Marty Makary, who leads the Food and Drug Administration, announced the review would go forward. Research over many years shows that mifepristone is very safe and effective when used with misoprostol in a two-drug treatment. When used together, the medication works more than 95% of the time. Abortion rights groups and major medical organizations say this review is just a political move designed to restrict abortion access in the United States even more. Pence Wants Trump to Fire RFK Jr. Over Abortion Pill – https://t.co/dg1FEuJJqC https://t.co/IMKcT9F3OA — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) December 16, 2025 The political tensions around major health policy decisions have been rising, similar to how RFK Jr.’s FDA has forced controversial vaccine reviews that horrified health officials. The push for the review is mostly based on a study published earlier this year by an anti-abortion think tank. Advancing American Freedom included that same report in their Monday memo as a reason for demanding the safety review. This is not the first time Pence has targeted someone in this controversy. Last week, he joined many anti-abortion groups asking FDA Commissioner Marty Makary to step down. BREAKING: RFK Jr. just ordered a full FDA review of the abortion pill. Why? Because a bombshell study shows 11% of women taking it suffer serious complications—not the “0.5%” the FDA claimed. It's not just killing babies. It’s killing mothers. pic.twitter.com/TiWwsq8EHl — Rod D. Martin (@RodDMartin) August 3, 2025 This aggressive approach shows the growing divide between the anti-abortion Evangelical part of the party, led by Pence, and President Trump’s administration. While President Trump once took credit for appointing the conservative Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, he has since tried to appear more moderate on reproductive health issues. This puts Kennedy and Makary right in the middle of a political battle. The Republican health care strategy has faced mounting criticism, with Trump’s recent comments revealing tensions as the strategy implodes . The White House is not taking Pence’s demands seriously. White House spokesperson Kush Desai gave a blunt response about Pence’s opinions. “Mike Pence dreams of the day when his unsolicited opinions make him slightly relevant again.

2025-12-16T20:00:00,The Pentagon just escalated its politically charged probe into Mark Kelly over a statement every soldier is taught,"The Pentagon just kicked its preliminary review into Senator Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) up a massive notch, escalating the process to an official Command Investigation, as per The Hill . This is a huge development in the politically charged probe centered on the retired Navy captain’s participation in a video where he advised U.S. service members to disobey “illegal orders.” Kelly, who served 25 years in the U.S. Navy and retired with the rank of captain, is under investigation for what the department calls “serious allegations of misconduct.” The investigation stems from a joint clip Kelly made with five other Democratic lawmakers who also have military or intelligence backgrounds. In the clip, they told U.S. forces that they can refuse illegal orders potentially issued by the Trump administration, such as the contentious boat strikes in the Caribbean . Kelly immediately fired back at the administration, accusing President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of abusing their power. He warned that these actions “should send a shiver down the spine of every patriotic American.” Kelly stated that the administration is “threatening everything I fought and served for” across his military career, all because he “repeated something every service member is taught.” Kelly is framing the issue as standard military instruction being weaponized for political gain A Pentagon official confirmed the escalation, noting that Secretary Hegseth’s office and the Defense Department’s Office of General Counsel are now moving the review forward. The official stated that further official comments would be limited to “preserve the integrity of the proceedings.” This escalation comes after the initial “thorough review” began in late November when the Defense Department (DOD) first received the misconduct allegations. The timeline shows just how quickly the administration is pushing this process. The day after the initial review started, Hegseth ordered the Navy to wrap up its findings and submit them to the DOD by December 10. Just last week, the Navy submitted a report regarding potential punishments against the Arizona senator to the DOD’s Office of General Counsel. That office is currently providing a legal review and input, though the content of that specific report remains unclear.

The joint statement caused significant backlash from GOP lawmakers and President Trump. Kelly didn’t hold back when addressing the political pressure he feels he’s been under, noting that the official investigation follows previous threats against him . He specifically called out past statements from the administration. “It wasn’t enough for Donald Trump to say I should be hanged,” Kelly wrote on X. “It wasn’t enough for Pete Hegseth to threaten me with a court martial.” Kelly made it clear he won’t be intimidated by the official command investigation. He asserted that if Trump and Hegseth “think this will stop me from doing what I’ve done every day of my adult life, fighting for this country, then they’ve got the wrong guy.”",2025-12-17T11:45:53.752529,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/the-pentagon-just-escalated-its-politically-charged-probe-into-mark-kelly-over-a-statement-every-soldier-is-taught/,e78dad4455b41c9c0a5482b91d83836d350de438,417,en,0.1,"The Pentagon just kicked its preliminary review into Senator Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) up a massive notch, escalating the process to an official Command Investigation, as per The Hill .",other,0.25

She said that she and former President Barack Obama were supposed to meet the couple on the same night they died. According to HuffPost , the Obamas were very close friends with the Reiners for many years. Michelle Obama told Kimmel, “We’ve known them for many, many years, and we were supposed to be seeing them that night, last night, and we got the news.” It was a shock to get that news while preparing to see their friends. Rob and Michele Reiner were found dead in their Los Angeles home on December 14, 2025. Police arrested their middle son, Nick Reiner, saying he was “responsible for their deaths.” He is now in a Los Angeles County jail with no bail. The former first lady’s words stood in sharp contrast to recent political attacks President Trump made harsh comments about Rob Reiner on Monday. He claimed that Reiner died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” Trump later told reporters that he “wasn’t a fan of his at all” and called Reiner “a deranged person.” Michelle Obama seemed to respond to these comments while talking with Kimmel. She never said Trump’s name, but her words clearly opposed his “deranged” label. Trump has been making headlines lately, including when the cabinet released its controversial TikTok . She said, “Unlike some people, Rob and Michelle Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever want to know.” Michelle Obama tells Jimmy Kimmel that she and Barack had plans with Rob and Michele Reiner on Sunday: “We’ve known them for many, many years and we were supposed to be seeing them that night, and we got the news.

2025-12-16T19:30:00,A Republican lawmaker just slammed Trump’s push to reschedule this drug after the Biden administration set the stage for it,"Republican Representative Mike Lawler of New York just publicly stated that President Trump’s potential decision to change marijuana’s federal classification would be ill-advised, according to The Hill . Lawler made his opposition clear, arguing that rescheduling the drug simply isn’t a smart move right now. He thinks we need to seriously consider the current challenges the country faces with substance use disorder. The representative’s primary concern revolves around the drug’s role as a starting point for more serious addiction. He strongly believes that marijuana acts as a gateway drug. Lawler noted that most people who eventually use hard substances actually start out by using marijuana. He emphasized this point saying, “I think rescheduling marijuana is wrong. The fact is, marijuana is a gateway drug. Most of the people who end up using hard substances start out on marijuana.” Lawler is also reacting to the fact that today’s marijuana isn’t what it used to be. The concentration of THC, which is the main chemical that gets you high, has increased dramatically over the last few decades. If you look back at the 1990s, the average THC concentration was only about 5 percent. Now, you’re looking at products that hover between 15 and 20 percent. That’s a massive jump in potency, and it really changes the risk profile. What the Biden administration started, Trump is carrying forward, and that’s not sitting right with Lawler This political discussion comes immediately after President Trump announced recently that he is “considering” reclassifying cannabis as a less dangerous substance. You might remember that the Biden administration actually started the process to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug. However, that administration didn’t manage to complete the process before leaving office. Right now, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, a designation it has held since 1971. Schedule I is reserved for drugs that the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, says have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. That means marijuana currently sits in the same federal category as serious substances like heroin, LSD, and methamphetamines. Notably, Oregon went back to criminalizing possession of hard drugs in small quantities . GOP Rep. Lawler says it would be ""wrong"" for Trump to reclassify marijuana https://t.co/y73NkP2vwp — The Hill (@thehill) December 16, 2025 Moving marijuana to Schedule III would be a massive change. The DEA defines Schedule III drugs as having a moderate to low potential for dependence. This category includes substances like ketamine, testosterone, and anabolic steroids. For many people who use marijuana for medical purposes, this change would be a huge step forward for research and accessibility, despite the large funding cuts on medical research . However, Lawler’s opposition is strongly tied to the health risks associated with the drug. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has linked long-term marijuana use to several serious conditions including mental health problems, respiratory issues, and gastrointestinal issues. It also increases the risk of head, neck, or throat cancer. Despite the federal classification, the vast majority of states have already moved forward with legalization. Forty-two states, along with Washington, D.C., have legalized medical marijuana, while 24 states currently permit recreational use. Even with the widespread state legalization, Lawler remains firm in his opposition to a federal change. He added that, given the current challenges the country faces with substance use disorder, he doesn’t think rescheduling marijuana is wise.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.756498,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/a-republican-lawmaker-just-slammed-trumps-push-to-reschedule-this-drug-after-the-biden-administration-set-the-stage-for-it/,59ecb09ce4d83023e400e7916f59e7b4732235da,419,en,0.1,"Republican Representative Mike Lawler of New York just publicly stated that President Trump’s potential decision to change marijuana’s federal classification would be ill-advised, ",other,0.25

This is a big move that could change how Americans manage their money. The company, which already operates as a bank in Europe from Luxembourg, announced that it sent applications to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI). If approved, the new bank would be called “PayPal Bank” and would be based in Utah. This news matters a lot for small business owners and regular people. According to Engadget , PayPal doesn’t just want to handle payments anymore. They want to offer complete banking services. For regular customers, the biggest benefit is that they plan to offer savings accounts that earn interest. If your current bank barely pays you anything on your savings, having a tech company offer better rates is something worth watching. The main goal of this new bank seems to be helping small businesses. PayPal has already given out over $30 billion in loans and working capital to more than 420,000 business accounts around the world. CEO and President Alex Chriss pointed out that small businesses still have a hard time getting money to grow their companies. PayPal’s banking move could solve a major problem for small businesses If the application gets approved, PayPal Bank will be based in Utah. The company plans to offer savings accounts that earn interest for customers. As tech companies expand into financial services, concerns about AI and robotics in various industries continue to grow, with China’s latest robot displaying aggressive behavior . Many companies have applied to become banks this year, and their chances of approval are higher under the Trump administration.

She raised over $13 million from big investors. Now, federal agents are investigating her for lying to investors and banks. This is surprising because Luckey was well-known for giving money advice on TikTok . According to Business Insider , the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has filed a lawsuit against Luckey. They say she lied about how well her company was doing and used millions of dollars from investors for herself. The SEC says Luckey told investors that ComplYant was making over $250,000 each month by September 2022. But the truth is very different. The company never made more than $620 in one month and usually made only about $250 per month. Luckey also told investors that dozens or hundreds of new paying customers were signing up every month. In reality, the company got fewer than four new subscribers each month on average. The investors who believed her claims lost a lot of money. Luxury spending and broken promises define the scandal ComplYant was started in 2019 to help small businesses deal with complicated tax laws. In 2022, the company raised $5.5 million from investors. This funding round was led by Craft Ventures, a well-known San Francisco investment firm. One of its founders is David Sacks, who also advises the White House. The SEC claims Luckey took $2.2 million from the company and spent it on personal things. She allegedly used the money to pay for her house, her car, and Super Bowl tickets. The funds also went toward expensive vacations to Aspen, Miami Beach, Turks and Caicos, and Lisbon. Most shocking of all, she apparently paid for her wedding in the Caribbean with investor money.

The FBI and the United States Attorney’s Office started officially investigating in April this year. When someone called Luckey to ask about the charges, she said “I don’t have anything to offer you” and hung up the phone. @shilohluckey There are 15 days left in the year.

In a video, she said she grew up with “very poor financial habits” and that HabitLoop is “something I built on hard lessons.” While tech innovations continue to emerge, some developments show how rapidly the business world is evolving, from corporate leaders facing unexpected charges at restaurants to new financial regulations.

2025-12-16T19:00:00,"Some TV owners notice Microsoft quietly added something to their smart TVs, and there’s no way to get rid of it","LG TV owners have been in for a surprise following a recent webOS update: the Microsoft Copilot app has suddenly appeared on their smart TV home screens. What has caused frustration is not just its unexpected arrival, but the fact that users currently have no way to remove it from their devices. According to PC World , online communities are currently confused and annoyed. Many users are taking to social media and forums to express their irritation at having software automatically installed without consent, especially when it cannot be disabled or deleted. The sudden appearance of Copilot has left many questioning why such a significant change was made without providing an option to opt out. The app’s presence is the result of LG’s ongoing partnership with Microsoft. As part of its push toward what it calls “AI TV,” LG is integrating Microsoft Copilot to bring AI-powered features directly to its televisions. The company had previously announced that the collaboration would enable more intelligent search capabilities, content recommendations, and interactive experiences via Copilot. LG forces AI features without giving users a real choice Right now, the app is just a simple web shortcut that takes you to Copilot online for AI search and recommendations. Even as a shortcut, having unwanted software taking up space on your screen is annoying. It feels like losing control when an update forces an app onto your device without asking. Bloatware is common, but seeing it on a major smart TV platform like webOS is concerning. Similar to how tech companies push controversial features without user consent, forced software installations create unnecessary headaches for users. Even if you never plan to use AI search on your TV, the app stays on your device. Microsoft Copilot AI comes to LG TVs, and it cannot be removed. After Windows 11, Microsoft 365, and other products, Copilot is now being automatically installed on LG TVs.

Hiding the app is better than seeing it constantly, but it does not fix the real problem of forced installation. LG webOS TVs are now installing Microsoft Copilot automatically with no option to remove it pic.twitter.com/zLQwRg6wBd — Pirat_Nation (@Pirat_Nation) December 14, 2025 This situation shows the conflict between manufacturers pushing new features and users wanting control over their own expensive devices. LG’s “AI TV” plan promises faster features and personalized recommendations, but the company needs to let users truly uninstall apps, especially ones pushed without warning. Just as tech giants continue redesigning devices without asking users first , TV owners deserve control over what appears on their screens. Advanced AI features are good, but user experience means respecting what appears on the home screen. LG needs to fix this issue quickly to keep their customers happy and avoid backlash against their AI partnership plans.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.762450,Sadik Hossain,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/some-tv-owners-notice-microsoft-quietly-added-something-to-their-smart-tvs-and-theres-no-way-to-get-rid-of-it/,ce344b6adf9fb90f3a60515caed4961f55b14d3d,422,en,0.1,LG TV owners have been in for a surprise following a recent webOS update: the Microsoft Copilot app has suddenly appeared on their smart TV home screens.

2025-12-16T19:00:00,‘A wise man once said nothing’: Senate Republican blasts Trump after his bizarre rant following Rob Reiner’s tragic death,"Senator John Kennedy absolutely slammed President Trump this week after the president weighed in on the tragic deaths of acclaimed director and actor Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, as per The Hill . Kennedy joined a growing chorus of Republicans who are pushing back hard on the president for suggesting that Reiner’s death was somehow related to his long-standing political opposition to Trump . The Louisiana Senator didn’t mince words about the president’s decision to comment politically on the situation. Kennedy stated that there’s a simple rule for handling sensitive situations. “A wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he’s a wise man,” Kennedy explained. “I think President Trump should have said nothing.” Honestly, that’s a top-tier piece of advice right there, especially when dealing with a tragedy this profound. The whole controversy kicked off after President Trump posted a comment on Truth Social suggesting that Reiner’s political opposition to him was somehow related to the tragedy. Reiner was well known as a prolific Democratic donor and a fierce advocate for progressive causes. Trump’s rant on Reiner seems more deranged as the details about his death have emerged Trump wrote that Reiner, a “tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star,” had passed away, reportedly due to the “anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.” The president continued by claiming Reiner was known to have driven people “CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump.” The reality of the situation is incredibly dark, and the details make the political commentary seem particularly inappropriate. The Reiners were found stabbed to death at their Los Angeles home over the weekend. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell confirmed that their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been “booked for murder” and is currently being held without bail. Senate Republican on Trump’s vile attack on murdered Director Reiner post: I think he ‘should have said nothing’ @Potus https://t.co/3tBkYvDCre — Deborah Kemp (@Deborah33742319) December 16, 2025 The president’s post immediately drew sharp criticism from Republicans across the political spectrum, including members who represent swing districts and those who have previously been critical of the president. Representatives Mike Lawler of New York and Don Bacon of Nebraska spoke out quickly against the post. Both men represent districts that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, making their criticism especially notable. Lawler stated flatly that Trump’s “statement is wrong.” He added that regardless of political views, no one should face violence, especially at the hands of their own child. Even Republicans who are often aligned with the president condemned the statement. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has been at odds with the president in recent weeks , responded that this is a “family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies.” Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky called the president’s comments “inappropriate and disrespectful.” Massie believes that most of his GOP colleagues will ignore the statement entirely because, as he put it, “they’re afraid.” He didn’t stop there, though, adding, “I challenge anyone to defend it.” That is a serious challenge, and it shows just how much discomfort this specific post caused within the Republican ranks.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.764932,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/a-wise-man-once-said-nothing-senate-republican-blasts-trump-after-his-bizarre-rant-following-rob-reiners-tragic-death/,6496b4879cdd7ddca3c848922b4ab8a0aac99907,423,en,0.1,"Senator John Kennedy absolutely slammed President Trump this week after the president weighed in on the tragic deaths of acclaimed director and actor Rob Reiner and his wife, Miche",other,0.25
2025-12-15T23:45:00,International student couldn’t land a tech job so he showed up to an event wearing something that got everyone tapping his shoulder,"Yerjasn Ait, who goes by Jason, wore his resume printed on a white T-shirt to stand out at a tech event. The front showed his full resume, while the back had a big message that said “Internship Wanted. CV’s on the front.” He showed up at the GeekWire Gala in Seattle on Thursday night, where more than 750 people from the tech industry were present. With mass layoffs and a tough job market making it hard for many tech workers to find jobs, Ait’s creative idea was a smart way to get noticed. “I was wondering how I can stand out in a crowd, because I’m an international student, my English is not perfect, and I’m still learning a lot of things,” Ait told GeekWire. Ait grew up in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and moved to the U.S. about a year and a half ago. His bold T-shirt idea turned heads at a major tech event He’s currently studying for his Master’s degree in Communication at the University of Washington and plans to graduate in June. He’s looking for an internship or entry-level job where he can use his skills in people management, product development, and problem solving. The T-shirt got plenty of attention at the event. Around 25 to 30 people tapped Ait on the shoulder to praise his creative approach or give him their business cards. It was only his second time going to an event like this, and he had to push through his nervousness. In the tech world, bold moves like this are becoming more common, similar to how GameStop recently poached Best Buy’s star employee in a surprising hiring move. However, this wasn’t the only case of jobseekers printing their resumes on T-shirts. “I was so scared to speak with people who are very successful, they’re professionals, experts, and it was like imposter syndrome at the beginning,” he said. “Somehow I overcame this fear and just started talking with people. And that’s fun.” Things almost went wrong before the event even started. Ait was still getting his T-shirt printed just two hours before the Gala began. A QR code that was supposed to link to his online resume didn’t make it onto the shirt, and then he got stuck in Seattle traffic on his way to the venue. Getting around Seattle can be tricky, though Google Maps’ new driving feature aims to help with navigation challenges. Finding a job is especially tough right now. Tech job postings in Seattle are still much lower than they were before the pandemic. Changes in the tech industry, including the rise of artificial intelligence, have made things even more uncertain for job seekers. But Ait is staying hopeful and determined to find his dream job in the U.S.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.766915,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/other-news/international-student-couldnt-land-a-tech-job-so-he-showed-up-to-an-event-wearing-something-that-got-everyone-tapping-his-shoulder/,621051143a7c665f43fc7540d74ea1f9bb055007,424,en,0.1,"Yerjasn Ait, who goes by Jason, wore his resume printed on a white T-shirt to stand out at a tech event.

2025-12-15T23:30:00,"Google just dropped a new AI feature that instantly makes Apple look embarrassing, but it’s the sheer scale that truly destroys the competition","According to Techspot , Google just rolled out a massive update to the Google Translate app, introducing Gemini-powered live speech translation that blows competing features like Apple’s out of the water. Live translation is quickly becoming one of the most practical and competitive uses of generative AI, and this new approach by Google scales far wider, supporting significantly more languages and far more headphone models than anything else out there. Starting today, if you own an Android device, you can jump into the beta and begin testing this powerful feature. This isn’t just a simple text-to-speech engine, which is great news for conversational clarity. The new AI integration relies on Gemini to make text translations sound much more natural and nuanced than they did before. If you’re using the Google Translate app, you can now sync your device with any pair of headphones to receive live translations of conversations, speeches, movies, and even TV shows. I love that Gemini attempts to keep the original speaker’s tone, emphasis, and cadence intact. Plus, both live and text translations can localize idioms instead of translating them literally, which is a huge quality-of-life improvement that prevents awkward misunderstandings. It’s the scale of this new Google feature that makes Apple look amateur-ish The beta is currently live on Android devices across the US, Mexico, and India, and it supports over 70 languages right away. That list includes major languages like English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Crucially, it also covers more specific languages like Zulu, Ukrainian, standard Arabic, and Palestinian Arabic. If you’re an iPhone user, don’t worry too much; support for iOS devices and more countries is expected to arrive next year. Compare that incredible reach to what Apple is offering. Apple introduced a similar live translation feature with iOS 26. While users with iPhones that support Apple Intelligence can get live translations of text and verbal conversations, the audio feature is painfully limited. It only supports a few select AirPods models, and it’s restricted to just nine languages: Mandarin Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and European Spanish. Google smashes language barriers with live translation for any earbuds on Android — here’s how it works | TechRadar https://t.co/eNmFrhDQ0I — IT Solutions Yorkshire (@ITSolutionsYork) December 15, 2025 This massive difference in functionality reflects Google’s aggressive investment in Gemini. Gemini is rapidly catching up to ChatGPT’s user base, forcing competitors like OpenAI to pivot their feature roadmap just to counter Google’s progress. Apple Intelligence, by comparison, is a latecomer to the whole AI battle and still relies heavily on external models such as GPT. The long-term maturity of Google Translate also helps explain why Gemini’s language support is so much broader right out of the gate. While the live audio translation is definitely the star of the show, Google also updated its standard text translations. Gemini-powered text translations are now available in the US and India, supporting 20 languages including Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, and German. You can try these improved text translations on the Android and iOS apps, as well as on the web. Finally, Google didn’t forget about language learners. The Translate app has updated its language learning tools to resemble Duolingo more closely. These courses now provide improved feedback and allow you to track your daily progress easily. Support has expanded to almost 20 new countries, including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan, which is excellent for global accessibility. Besides this revolutionary progress in translation, Google also made strides recently by introducing realistic ‘Likeness’ avatars for Android XR users and a nifty way to find your car in huge, confusing parking lots .",2025-12-17T11:45:53.768403,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/google-just-dropped-a-new-ai-feature-that-instantly-makes-apple-look-embarrassing-but-its-the-sheer-scale-that-truly-destroys-the-competition/,2dfd6b83107da566d25787988c69ddda5eb213cf,425,en,0.1,"According to Techspot , Google just rolled out a massive update to the Google Translate app, introducing Gemini-powered live speech translation that blows competing features like A",other,0.25
2025-12-15T23:15:00,Google’s most recent update changes how it understands you and it’s not at all what you’d expect,"Google is updating its Translate service with major new features powered by Gemini AI. The update brings real-time speech translation through any headphones and smarter text translations. These changes help users understand not just words in a foreign language, but also the speaker’s intent, tone, and cultural meaning. According to Digital Trends , the biggest new feature is live speech-to-speech translation, which is currently available in beta. Using Gemini’s audio technology, the system streams real-time translations directly into your ears through any headphones you use. The system doesn’t just translate words: it keeps the speaker’s pace, tone, and emphasis intact. This means you can follow conversations, lectures, or media without the robotic sound that older translation systems had. Android users in the U.S., Mexico, or India can try the live translation beta right now in the Translate app. The feature supports more than 70 languages. iOS users will have to wait longer, as iPhone support and wider country availability are planned for 2026. Gemini-powered text translations solve the context problem The text translation improvements might be even more important than the live audio feature. For years, machine translation struggled with context, idioms, local slang, and emotional phrases. Word-for-word translations often created awkward or misleading results. Gemini fixes this by analyzing the meaning and intent behind phrases, not just individual words. The translations now sound more accurate and natural, like something a person would actually say. These smarter text translations are rolling out today in Google Search and the Translate app. The initial release covers translations between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, and German. The feature works on Android, iOS, and web browsers. The launch starts in the U.S. and India. Google has been making several updates lately, including how Maps tackles parking challenges for drivers.

2025-12-15T23:00:00,"63,000 children stage mass revolt with angry letters, half of them threatening to leave country over one baffling state ban","Children in Russia have staged a massive revolt, sending 63,000 complaint letters to the Kremlin after the government banned the popular gaming platform Roblox, as per Tom’s Hardware . The state representative who confirmed the figures said that a staggering half of those irate young gamers threatened to leave the country entirely because of the blockade. This level of revolt shows just how massive Roblox really is. As recently as 2023, the game was the most downloaded title in Russia. It boasts 111.8 million daily users globally, and around 40 percent of those gamers are 13 years old or younger. When you block a platform that popular, you’re going to get some serious pushback. The government implemented the ban claiming it was strictly “for their own protection.” The official Russian media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, asserted that the game is full of “inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children.” They claim the California-based platform was being used to distribute extremist materials and promote “LGBT propaganda.” The Roblox ban has done what an invasion into another sovereign nation couldn’t do But there are also some claims here that are genuinely worrying for parents everywhere. The Russian watchdog specifically mentioned that children playing Roblox may be sexually harassed, tricked into sending intimate photos, or even “coerced into committing depraved acts and violence.” For its part, the Roblox corporation maintains that it works hard to keep its users safe. The company asserts that it implements “moderators and automated systems to proactively identify behaviors that may violate our policies.” The level of complaint has gotten so loud that it has reached the highest levels of the Russian administration. Dmitry Peskov, President Putin’s well-known press secretary, confirmed that the Kremlin received “many” letters from children about the ban. It’s ironic when Russia’s war crimes reportedly include sending Ukraining children to North Korean military camps . Russian media finally admits Putin is under fire from angry citizens, but it's for the recent #Roblox ban — Kremlin says kids have written 63,000 complaint letters, half said they wanted to leave Russia due to the ban https://t.co/YkHtKocawf — Pascal Heyman (@PascalHeyman) December 15, 2025 Even more specific figures came from pro-Kremlin censorship advocate Yekaterina Mizulina. She told her followers that she personally received 63,000 letters from kids aged between eight and 16 concerning this ban. The fact that half of those children said they wished to leave Russia due to the Roblox blockade really drives home how much this platform means to them. It’s not just a game; it’s a social space. If you’re wondering why Roblox was suddenly targeted, it helps to look at the broader landscape. This platform is just the latest in a long line of Western-owned social media services to get blocked in Russia. You can’t use Instagram, Facebook, Threads, Twitter/X, or LinkedIn there either. Notably, the European Union imposed retaliatory tariffs on US-based social media apps , but users were spared from any hassle. Meanwhile, platforms like YouTube are often throttled and disrupted, which encourages people to use the state-backed alternative, RuTube. Russia’s domestic social network, VK, is the most widely used in the country. It’s heavily moderated and features automatic content filtering according to the government’s blacklist. Blocking Roblox seems to be part of the ongoing strategy to push users toward these heavily controlled domestic alternatives.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.771380,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/tech/63000-children-stage-mass-revolt-with-angry-letters-half-of-them-threatening-to-leave-country-over-one-baffling-state-ban/,d2d257932f67a8ab5d8213c18271347bb02a046f,427,en,0.1,"Children in Russia have staged a massive revolt, sending 63,000 complaint letters to the Kremlin after the government banned the popular gaming platform Roblox, as per Tom’s Hardwa",other,0.25

Sources close to the family say their son, Nick Reiner, is responsible for their deaths. The 78-year-old director and his 68-year-old wife were discovered after the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call around 3:30 PM. According to People , the police are now questioning 32-year-old Nick Reiner about the deaths. No arrests have been made yet, and authorities haven’t officially confirmed what happened. But the fact that the couple’s own son is being questioned makes this case especially tragic for everyone involved. Nick has a troubled history with drug addiction that goes back to his teenage years. He started going to rehab facilities when he was just 15 years old. His addiction became so severe that he eventually left home and lived on the streets for long periods of time, moving between different states. Nick Reiner turned his struggle with homelessness into a film before this tragedy Nick wrote about his addiction and time living homeless in a semi-autobiographical film called Being Charlie . In a 2016 interview, he said he had been doing better and felt stable. He mentioned feeling settled after returning home, saying he had been living in Los Angeles with his family for a long time. Those comments now seem heartbreaking given the current situation. “Now, I’ve been home for a really long time, and I’ve sort of gotten acclimated back to being in L.A. and being around my family,” he said at that time.

2025-12-15T22:30:00,"Despite seeing FBI evidence linking the assassin to the crime, Charlie Kirk’s widow is meeting the conspiracy theorist who refuses to believe it","Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is planning a private, in-person discussion with right-wing podcast host Candace Owens, according to The Hill . This is a massive development, signaling that one of the most contentious and upsetting feuds within the conservative media sphere is moving off social media and into a conference room. The entire public disagreement centers on the tragic death of Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot back on September 10. Kirk confirmed the meeting on X, making it clear that the public aspect of the fight is officially on pause. She wrote, “Candace Owens and I are meeting for a private, in-person discussion on Monday, December 15.” That’s a smart move, because the constant tweeting and livestreaming have only amplified the pain and confusion surrounding the incident. Kirk added that we shouldn’t expect any further public drama until the discussion is complete. She continued, “@RealCandaceO and I have agreed that public discussions, livestreams, and tweets are on hold until after this meeting.” She closed her post by expressing optimism, stating, “I look forward to a productive conversation. Thank you.” Owens quickly responded to the announcement, writing that she was “very much looking forward to this discussion.” Erika probably found some holes in the FBI’s findings and wants to check the notes with Candace You have to understand the level of conflict involved to grasp why this meeting is such a big deal. Candace Owens has emerged as a prominent voice pushing conspiracy theories that attempt to provide an alternative explanation for Charlie Kirk’s death. The Kirk family is dealing with unspeakable grief, but they also have to contend with unproven claims constantly flying around the internet, causing serious friction among groups who usually agree politically. Owens has frequently promoted these theories about the incident, but she hasn’t provided any solid proof for the claims. This is happening despite the fact that federal law enforcement has already laid out a clear, evidence-based case. FBI officials have officially charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with the fatal shooting, and they’ve released a substantial amount of evidence against him. Robinson was spotted laughing in his first court hearing recently. Erika Kirk to meet privately with conservative podcaster Candace Owens https://t.co/4lW1DOmK0d — The Hill (@thehill) December 15, 2025 Prosecutors say Robinson confessed to his romantic partner, which is a significant piece of the puzzle. He also appeared to confess in group messages on the Discord app. The evidence is so compelling that even Robinson’s own family recognized him after authorities released images of the suspected shooter. His parents reportedly convinced their son to turn himself in to the police. Despite the fact that the FBI has provided this mountain of evidence, Owens has continued to doubt the official explanation. This is exactly why Erika Kirk has had to address the theories directly. During a CBS News town hall, Erika Kirk was asked about the conspiracy theories promoted by Owens and others. She dismissed the claims as baseless. She made it crystal clear that she has personally seen the FBI evidence linking the accused assassin directly to the shooting.

2025-12-15T22:15:00,"Mechanic shows what’s causing that dull clunk in your steering column, and why the solution is easier than you think","If you own an early-2000s GM truck like a Silverado, Tahoe, or Sierra, you’ve probably heard that annoying clunk in your steering column. The good news is that a mechanic named Andrew Parker from Whistlers Auto Repair in Oklahoma has finally explained what causes it and how to fix it. He shared a video on TikTok that got over 1,100 views, and truck owners are now realizing they don’t have to live with this problem anymore. According to Motor1 , the issue affects GM trucks built between 1999 and 2006. These trucks have a two-piece steering shaft that’s designed to collapse during a crash for safety. Over time, the grease inside this shaft dries out, and that’s when you start hearing the clunk or thud, especially when driving over bumps. Parker’s fix is simple but requires a bit of work. You need to disconnect the shaft inside the cabin and slide it out to reach the dry parts. Then, you have to move the shaft back and forth about 15 times to spread the old grease around again. Parker compared it to “pumping a pump jack” to get the grease flowing. Once the grease is spread evenly, the noise usually goes away. The real reason this problem keeps coming back The clunk happens because the grease moves away from the contact points after thousands of miles of driving. Vibration and heat cause the lubricant to drift, making the shaft rough and noisy. One truck owner said, “My ’05 Silverado does it, and so does my friend’s,” showing how common this problem is. The good news is this isn’t dangerous. Your steering won’t suddenly fail. GM acknowledged this issue years ago and released technical service bulletins telling mechanics to either lubricate or replace the shaft. However, fixing it does make the steering feel tighter and more responsive, which is great for a truck that’s almost 20 years old. In a similar story, a mechanic spotted a surprise LED bulb problem in his daughter’s truck . @whistlers.auto Early 2000 model GM trucks and suburbans etc.  Ugga dugga thugga noise over bumps! #chevrolet #gmc #whistlersauto #trucksoftiktok ♬ original sound – Whistler’s Auto Parker’s TikTok trick works, but it’s often temporary. The grease will eventually drift again, and the noise comes back months or years later. That’s why many mechanics skip this step and either inject fresh grease or replace the whole shaft. If you try this fix yourself, be careful not to twist the shaft or disconnect things incorrectly, as this can damage your steering wheel’s clock spring or cause alignment problems. Because the noise usually returns, many owners choose to replace the shaft completely. New shafts cost between $100 and $200, and some aftermarket companies sell improved versions that prevent the noise permanently. But if this is your first time hearing the clunk, it’s smart to get a professional inspection. Old trucks can also have noisy suspension parts that sound similar. Some owners try buying cheap replacement parts to save money , but this can backfire badly.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.776339,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/news-cars/mechanic-shows-whats-causing-that-dull-clunk-in-your-steering-column-and-why-the-solution-is-easier-than-you-think/,884b7cd13c2b6aa46a5132d61b22fd2a12124cf7,430,en,0.1,"If you own an early-2000s GM truck like a Silverado, Tahoe, or Sierra, you’ve probably heard that annoying clunk in your steering column.

This is just an awful scenario that makes you question how someone could do something so malicious to unsuspecting customers. The driver, Kourtney Stevenson, was cuffed and booked on account of some heavy charges, including consumer product tampering and battery resulting in moderate bodily injury. Cops say Stevenson was working a late-night DoorDash shift in Indiana when she allegedly contaminated an Arby’s order right before the drop-off. You can’t imagine the shock of the people waiting for their food. The situation immediately turned horrifying for the couple once the food arrived. One of the victims stated that his wife took just a few bites of the order before she suddenly started gasping for air and vomiting. That’s a truly frightening reaction to food you just ordered. After his wife became ill, the husband checked the bag and quickly spotted a strange residue coating the contents. That residue turned out to be pepper spray. The video made everything make sense, and incriminated the DoorDash driver The couple understandably wanted to know exactly how their food became contaminated. They decided to review their doorbell footage, and the video provided the shocking, undeniable proof. The footage shows the driver setting down the bag on the porch, taking the required delivery photo to confirm the drop-off, and then allegedly spraying the food bag before walking away. It’s hard to watch someone perform a standard delivery step and then immediately follow it up with a deliberate act of assault. Investigators were able to quickly locate and arrest Stevenson. When confronted, she allegedly offered an excuse that investigators found completely unbelievable. Stevenson claimed that she was actually spraying a spider near the food bag. However, investigators didn’t buy that story at all, pointing out that spiders generally aren’t wandering around outside when the weather is 35 degrees.

The company made it clear that they have zero tolerance for any conduct that puts customer safety at risk. Their company policy regarding compulsory deliveries from corporate employees recently made rounds on the internet. It’s a huge relief that the couple had doorbell footage to prove what happened, otherwise this terrifying incident might have been much harder to prosecute. While this is an extremely rare occurrence, it’s a serious reminder that when you’re dealing with third-party delivery services, there’s always an element of trust involved. Hopefully, the quick arrest and the severe charges Stevenson is facing will send a strong message about the unacceptability of this kind of alleged behavior.

The agents asked him to show proof that he is a U.S. citizen. This is concerning because Omar’s son was born in the United States. According to NBC News , Omar talked to the media on Sunday and explained what happened. She said her son was pulled over by ICE agents right after leaving a Target store. The situation ended when he showed his passport. “Once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,” Omar said. Omar came to the U.S. when she was 12 years old after her family left Somalia during the civil war. She accused ICE of racially targeting the Somali community. She believes agents are looking for young Somali men they think don’t have legal papers. About 80,000 people of Somali background live in Minnesota. The incident follows growing concerns about immigration enforcement in Minnesota ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and Omar’s office have not commented on Saturday’s incident. However, an administration official said before that ICE is not specifically targeting Somali immigrants. Many lawmakers have been speaking out about what immigrants should know about their legal rights during ICE encounters. Omar spoke about this issue just two days after she sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security about immigration operations in Minnesota. She also joined other Democratic lawmakers to ask questions about a promise President Donald Trump made last month.

Last week in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Trump told a crowd, “We always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right?” He called the country “filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.” Trump’s focus on Minnesota and Omar comes after reports that dozens of people of Somali background were convicted for fraud schemes. These schemes stole around $1 billion in Covid relief funds. The president has been vocal about his frustrations with the deportation process and immigration enforcement challenges. However, Omar said people should not blame an entire community for individual crimes. “Here in the United States, we don’t blame the crimes of an individual on a whole community,” Omar said.

This story is wild, and frankly, it’s a perfect example of why Dunkin’s reputation for inconsistency is totally earned sometimes, maybe on par with Elon Musk’s reputation . Content creator Eden McLeod, who goes by @eden.moro online, shared the baffling incident in a viral video on TikTok, joking that the barista almost killed her. McLeod explained that she was trying to get a sugar-free caramel macchiato. She simply asked the employee if they had sugar-free syrups available, and when he confirmed they did, she told him to use whatever was necessary to make the drink. “‘Whatever sugar-free syrup that you need to use to make that a caramel macchiato, go ahead and use that for me, fella,’” she recalled saying. As she watched him prepare her order, she noticed a worrying amount of liquid going into the cup. “I see him squirting my drink. I’m like, ‘Dang, that’s a lot of sugar-free,’” she remembered. However, she decided to trust the process, telling herself, “As long as it don’t kill me, I’m gonna drink it.” The concoction was enough to kill her taste buds momentarily as she took the first sip “I took that first sip, and I said, you know how you gotta look at something like, ‘What the freak?’” McLeod explained. She said her eyes immediately started watering and she “literally felt like I had to vomit.” Thinking her peppermint gum might have been interfering with the flavor, she tried again. “I take another sip, and literally, I couldn’t even see. My eyes were so blurry,” she said. That’s a truly awful experience, and I can’t imagine taking a drink that makes you instantly regret everything. Understandably, McLeod marched right back to Dunkin’ to figure out what happened. She found the employee who made her drink and told him it tasted like battery acid and that she almost vomited. His justification was truly baffling. “He said, ‘Well, you said you wanted all the sugar-free syrups,’” McLeod recounted in disbelief. @eden.moro CRAZY WORK… luckily he was extremely sweet and we laughed about it at the end… but that was the WORST @Dunkin’  dunkindonuts customerservice coffeetiktok sugarfreelifestyle ♬ original sound – edenmmcleod The employee then listed the entire roster of sugar-free flavors he had intentionally dumped into her single macchiato: coconut, blueberry, raspberry, vanilla, and caramel. “Every sugar-free freaking syrup he owns, he put in my caramel macchiato,” she said. McLeod pointed out the obvious issue with this logic, asking, “George, why would I want that? Who would want a drink with fruit and milk?” She also noted that he never once questioned her bizarre order or tried to double-check that she actually wanted a grotesque flavor combination of every sugar-free option they stocked. “I thought you poisoned me, George,” she joked to him afterward. While the employee, who McLeod said was “extremely sweet,” remade the drink correctly and they laughed about the incident, she maintained it was the worst drink she had ever tasted. McLeod found out the hard way that too much of a good or bad thing can be truly stomach-churning.

The Mission Impossible actor and his director, Doug Liman, have been working on this project since 2020, but the current political situation has basically ended it. Filming 250 miles above Earth needs serious planning. The movie would need help from both NASA and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. According to Unilad , this meant Cruise needed permission from the federal government, which required approval from President Trump. The source explained the problem, saying Cruise did not want to ask Donald Trump for a favor. He would need permission from the federal government to get NASA’s help for the movie. Cruise has always been careful to avoid taking political sides. He worries that getting involved in politics might upset or divide his huge global fanbase. This choice matches his recent actions. Earlier this year, Cruise turned down an honor from the president at the Kennedy Center, saying he had scheduling conflicts. The 63-year-old star stays away from politics to protect his career Just days after President Trump suggested 100 percent taxes on movies made outside the US, Cruise was asked about it at a press event in Seoul for Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning. His answer was quick and simple: “We’d rather answer questions about the movie. Thanks.” This is a big loss for the film industry because this project would have been a world first. Director Doug Liman, who also made The Bourne Identity, was excited about pushing filmmaking into new territory. Cruise is known for his dedication to authenticity, and his extreme sacrifices for past roles show just how far he’ll go for his craft. Just three months ago, Liman said he was looking forward to making the movie. Tom Cruise’s SpaceX NASA movie has been scrapped.

2025-12-15T21:00:00,Donald Trump just declared war on his own party and ripped one Republican leader as a ‘total loser’ after a sudden betrayal,"President Trump is absolutely furious at Republicans in the Indiana State Senate after they rejected a new congressional map he supported, leading him to refresh his pledge to back primary challenges against them, as per The Hill . He specifically targeted one legislative leader, calling him a “total loser.” This is a huge internal war brewing, and honestly, it’s pretty bad for party unity right now. The drama started when the Indiana State Senate voted 19-31 against the new House map favoring Republicans. This was a significant loss for President Trump, who had been actively pressing state lawmakers to approve the new lines. When the upper chamber rejected the map, some senators even applauded the decision. President Trump took to Truth Social to lay down the law and threaten political retribution. He made it clear that he views the opposing Republicans as traitors to the cause, as he has used the same word for his party members before . He said that “Republicans in the Indiana State Senate, who voted against a Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be ashamed of themselves.” Indiana State Senate Republicans are the latest to end up in Trump’s firing line The president didn’t stop there. He targeted a specific individual, adding that the group was “Headed by a total loser named Rod Bray, every one of these people should be ‘primaried,’ and I will be there to help!” He also pointed out that “Indiana, which I won big, is the only state in the Union to do this!” This kind of bitter redistricting fight isn’t just happening in Indiana, and some Republicans are deeply worried about the national consequences of these aggressive map-drawing efforts. Senator Rand Paul, who represents Kentucky, weighed in on Sunday, suggesting that these widespread battles might actually result in “more violence in this country,” which is bad news with the US already dealing with rising political violence as a result of Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric . Sen. Rand Paul says redistricting efforts could lead to political violence https://t.co/MJRj9rkX6C pic.twitter.com/74kh9Oqezq — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) December 15, 2025 Paul discussed the issue of mid-decade redistricting on NBC News after being asked by Kristen Welker if he supported Republicans trying to redraw maps mid-decade. He explained that this process is a dangerous “escalation on both sides.” You can certainly argue about who started it, but Paul is more concerned about the negative outcome when both parties engage in these tactics. He believes this political gamesmanship is going to lead to “more civil tension and possibly more violence in our country.” His reasoning is pretty straightforward: people feel unrepresented, and that creates serious resentment. Paul gave a couple of strong examples to explain his concern. He pointed out that if 35 percent of Texas is solidly Democrat but they have zero representation, that’s a massive problem for democracy. He also used his own state as an example. Kentucky is overwhelmingly Republican, but there is one Democratic area in Louisville that has a Democrat congressman. Paul noted that Republicans “could carve up Louisville and get rid of that one congressman.” But then he asked the critical question: “how does that make Democrats feel?” He quickly answered that he thinks it makes them feel “like they’re not represented.” It’s clear that President Trump views the refusal of the Indiana State Senate to push his preferred maps as a direct act of war against his agenda, and he’s ready to support primary challenges to ensure those who defied him are removed.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.784771,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/donald-trump-just-declared-war-on-his-own-party-and-ripped-one-republican-leader-as-a-total-loser-after-a-sudden-betrayal/,3dd126f52136edc0995e93110d16724233f61f5b,435,en,0.1,"President Trump is absolutely furious at Republicans in the Indiana State Senate after they rejected a new congressional map he supported, leading him to refresh his pledge to back",other,0.25

2025-12-15T20:30:00,Johnson & Johnson’s sickening conspiracy to hide decades of danger just cost them millions in a massive verdict over their baby powder,"Johnson & Johnson just got slapped with a massive $40 million verdict by a California jury after two women successfully argued that the company’s talc-based baby powder was responsible for their ovarian cancer, according to The Guardian . This is a critical finding because the jury in Los Angeles superior court determined that J&J knew its talc products were dangerous for years but deliberately failed to warn consumers about the risks. The verdict splits the award between two California residents who testified about their devastating battles with cancer. Monica Kent, who was diagnosed in 2014, received $18 million. Deborah Schultz and her husband were awarded $22 million; Schultz was diagnosed in 2018. Both women stated they had used J&J’s baby powder after bathing for approximately 40 years. Their testimony included details about major surgeries and dozens of chemotherapy rounds required for their treatments. This verdict confirms what the plaintiffs’ lawyers have been arguing for years: J&J knew about this problem for decades. Andy Birchfield, an attorney for the women, told the jury during closing arguments that the company was aware as far back as the 1960s that the product could potentially cause cancer. Birchfield did not mince words, saying, “Absolutely they knew, they knew and they were doing everything they could to hide it, to bury the truth about the dangers.” J&J’s defense team is sticking to its guns, claiming the connection is baseless Allison Brown, representing the company, argued that the only people telling Kent and Schultz that talc caused their cancers were their own lawyers. Brown told the jury that the alleged link is not supported by any major US health authority. With the EPA greenlighting PFAs in pesticides now and budget cuts on bodies like NIH , there’s little hope from them anyway. She also pointed out that no study proves talc can actually migrate from the outside of the body to reach the reproductive organs. Naturally, J&J plans to fight this ruling. Erik Haas, the worldwide vice-president of litigation for J&J, stated that the company will “immediately appeal this verdict and expect to prevail as we typically do with aberrant adverse verdicts.” The company maintains that its products are safe, that they do not contain asbestos, and that they do not cause cancer. However, J&J stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the US back in 2020, switching instead to a cornstarch version. A California jury on Friday awarded $40 million to two women who said Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder was to blame for their ovarian cancer. https://t.co/zigxEJTPE2 — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) December 15, 2025 This case is just the tip of the iceberg, though. J&J is currently facing lawsuits from more than 67,000 plaintiffs who claim they were diagnosed with cancer after using the company’s talc products. The majority of these claims involve ovarian cancer, but the company also faces claims alleging talc caused mesothelioma, a rare and deadly cancer. J&J has even been hit with substantial verdicts in mesothelioma cases recently, including one for more than $900 million in Los Angeles. The company has tried desperately to contain the financial fallout by resolving the massive litigation through bankruptcy proceedings. Unfortunately for J&J, federal courts have rejected this proposal three separate times. Before the bankruptcy attempts, J&J’s trial record was mixed. While they have won some trials outright and successfully appealed to reduce other large verdicts, they have also been hit with staggering awards, including one verdict that reached $4.69 billion for women who claimed baby powder caused their ovarian cancer. With 67,000 pending cases, you can bet the legal battles for J&J are far from over.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.787250,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/johnson-johnsons-sickening-conspiracy-to-hide-decades-of-danger-just-cost-them-millions-in-a-massive-verdict-over-their-baby-powder/,e789910f754905a6a53511d22e05adf64e9cc9f8,437,en,0.1,Johnson & Johnson just got slapped with a massive $40 million verdict by a California jury after two women successfully argued that the company’s talc-based baby powder was respons,other,0.25

The messages included odd phrases like PEPPER SHAKER, TRANSFER, PABODOLL, SPINOBAZ, FRIGORIA, OPALNY, SNOPOVY, and MYUONOSVOD. No one knows what these codes mean, which makes the situation more alarming. The station has been sending out a continuous buzzing sound on 4625 kHz since the 1970s during the Cold War. The buzz lasts about one to 1.2 seconds and repeats 21 to 34 times per minute. When the buzzing stops and a voice comes through, people pay close attention. The Russian government is likely behind these transmissions Professor David Stupples, who teaches electronic and radio engineering at City University of London, said it’s “almost certainly the Russian government” using the station. He noted that if Russia is behind it, the purpose wouldn’t be peaceful. “They may be just reserving the channel for air defence or some form of defence,” he speculated. Some experts think the military uses it for air defense communications. Others believe it’s a “Dead Man’s Switch” that could trigger a nuclear attack if the buzzing stops completely. The codes have been active all year, including one broadcast on May 19 before Vladimir Putin’s call with President Trump. Russia’s mysterious “Doomsday” radio station, UVB-76, just sent out four eerie, cryptic messages in only 24 hours: Neptune, Thymus, Foxcloak, and Nootabu. Active since 1975, this Cold War-era shortwave station usually emits nothing but a static buzz — until something big is… pic.twitter.com/zs8WUAr4hz — Shadow of Ezra (@ShadowofEzra) April 15, 2025 These transmissions come as NATO Chief Mark Rutte issued a serious warning about Russia’s threat. He said he wanted to be “crystal clear about the threat” and believes many NATO members are too relaxed. Rutte stated, “We are Russia’s next target, and we are already in harm’s way.” He stressed that time is running out and demanded quick action, saying “The time for action is now.” He called for NATO countries to increase defense spending and production. RUSSIA’S DOOMSDAY RADIO JUST NAMED A NATO COUNTRY – IS THIS A WARNING? For 50 years, Russia’s mysterious UVB-76 station – the infamous “Buzzer” – has broadcast nonstop.

On Friday, December 5, German lawmakers approved a plan to introduce voluntary military service starting in January. All 18-year-old men must fill out a questionnaire about joining the army, though it’s optional for women. Germany wants to grow its military to 260,000 troops over the next ten years. This comes as Putin warned how quickly war could end in a recent statement to Europe. However, students in up to 90 German cities are protesting this plan. They don’t want to spend months learning “drill and obedience and learning to kill.” Meanwhile, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko accused Europe of preparing for war. He warned that countries hosting American missiles are creating targets of themselves. Ukrainian Major Viktor Andrusiv warned that the UK, with only 70,000 active troops, is “not prepared for war” against Putin’s forces. He said the UK will “pay a higher price” for being poorly equipped with “outdated” tactics. He urged people to realize that drones and missiles attacking homes and cities “can be a reality.” Russia has already demonstrated its technical capabilities in other ways, such as when hundreds of Porsches were remotely disabled across the country. Putin has said Russia is “ready” for war with Europe if provoked, though he expressed some hope after his “very good” meeting with President Trump about a peace proposal.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.788243,Towhid Rafid,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/russias-mysterious-doomsday-radio-just-sent-another-series-of-coded-messages-and-what-was-heard-on-the-airwaves-is-raising-alarm/,72b150577a2212253241d3f035a262d2bbc44142,438,en,0.1,"Russia’s mysterious shortwave radio station, UVB-76, has broadcast over a dozen coded messages this week, raising concerns as NATO’s chief warns that member countries could be Mosc",other,0.25
2025-12-15T20:00:00,"The Trump adminsitration is begging the courts to let them stop providing this basic service, arguing it destroys his ‘prerogative to control the image’","The Trump administration is fighting hard in court to stop providing real-time American Sign Language interpretation for White House events, arguing that the service actually hurts the president’s ability to control his public image, as per AP News . This is a truly wild argument, and I have to say, it’s baffling why providing basic accessibility ruins an image. In a court filing opposing a request for a preliminary injunction, Department of Justice attorneys argued that being required to provide sign language interpretation for news conferences “would severely intrude on the President’s prerogative to control the image he presents to the public.” They further wrote that the president has “the prerogative to shape his Administration’s image and messaging as he sees fit.” AI-generated videos from official White House accounts are alright, though. The Justice Department attorneys have not elaborated on how adding an interpreter might actually hamper the portrayal President Donald Trump seeks to present to the public. This legal drama stems from a lawsuit filed by the National Association for the Deaf (NAD). The NAD argues that stopping the interpretation services is effectively “denying hundreds of thousands of deaf Americans meaningful access to the White House’s real-time communications on various issues of national and international import.” This is a direct attack from the Trump administration on accessibility, which is in line with its stance on DEI This is a major issue because the previous administration had used ASL interpretation regularly, so this move represents a clear step back for accessibility. The group had also sued during President Trump’s first administration, specifically seeking ASL interpretation for briefings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government is trying to say that this service isn’t even necessary because they offer other ways for the Deaf or hard-of-hearing community to access the information. Administration attorneys point to online transcripts of events or closed captioning as sufficient alternatives. They also claimed it would be super difficult to get interpreters ready if President Trump spontaneously decides to take questions from the press, especially if it’s not a formal briefing. Trump administration says sign language services ‘intrude’ on Trump’s ability to control his image: https://t.co/CXedKDohu1 pic.twitter.com/a79XfQyNjq — Western Mass News (@WMassNews) December 15, 2025 Fortunately, a federal judge wasn’t buying those objections last month. The judge issued an order that requires the White House to provide real-time ASL interpreting for remarks made by President Trump and Leavitt. The White House, predictably, has appealed that ruling. While the administration has started providing ASL interpreting at some events, there’s still disagreement over exactly what services they need to supply. This whole lawsuit fits right into a much larger trend we’ve seen since President Trump returned to office. Overturning policies related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become a major hallmark of his second administration, starting right in his first week back. He signed a sweeping executive order putting a stop to DEI programs across the entire U.S. government. We’ve seen other departments follow suit, too. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued an order in January stating that DEI policies were “incompatible” with the Pentagon’s mission. And just this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomatic correspondence to switch back to the more traditional Times New Roman font , arguing that the previous administration’s 2023 shift to the sans-serif Calibri font was misguided and emerged from those same DEI policies.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.789234,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/the-trump-adminsitration-is-begging-the-courts-to-let-them-stop-providing-this-basic-service-arguing-it-destroys-his-prerogative-to-control-the-image/,8867c83172fa3bd1d5355fe6f6903858fcc7bf9f,439,en,0.1,"The Trump administration is fighting hard in court to stop providing real-time American Sign Language interpretation for White House events, arguing that the service actually hurts",other,0.25

Carroll recently discovered his father’s remains buried under his childhood home in Long Island, New York, solving a mystery that had haunted his family since 1963. According to the Mirror , his father, George Carroll, vanished when Michael was just eight months old, leaving behind a young wife and infant son with no explanation. For decades, Michael lived with the story his mother, Dorothy, had always told him. George, a Korean War veteran, had gone out one day to buy cigarettes and never came back. There were no phone calls, no letters, and no trace of him. As the years passed, hope slowly faded, but the lack of closure was even harder to bear. The truth, when it finally surfaced, was far more disturbing than any rumour. Instead of leaving his family behind, George had been there all along; buried beneath the very house where his son took his first steps, unknowingly living above the remains of the father he never had the chance to know. A psychic’s strange claim turned out to be true In 2010, Michael’s sister Jean Kennedy visited a psychic. The psychic told her that their father was murdered and buried at their family home. Most people thought this sounded crazy, but it pushed Michael to search for answers. Documentary maker Patricia E. Gillespie said people thought Michael and Jean were wrong for years. She explained that others kept telling them, “Your dad left. Why can’t you accept this?” But the siblings refused to give up. “Our father was in the ground for 55 years while we just thought he abandoned us,” George Carroll's eldest son Steven, 68, said. “But somebody murdered him.” (Source: People) https://t.co/NmLFIhyG6I pic.twitter.com/8VOW9pazri — AOL.com (@AOL) December 7, 2025 Michael bought the family home from his mother in 1993.

They found George’s remains buried on the property. Police came to investigate, and tests confirmed the body was George Carroll. His death was ruled a homicide after experts found his skull was fractured from blunt force trauma. Like other murder cases where investigators found chilling digital evidence , forensic teams worked to piece together what happened. Gillespie noted that solving this mystery created many new questions about what really happened.

2025-12-15T19:30:00,The director-activist who raged about ‘losing our f –ing democracy’ is found deceased with his wife in a shocking discovery,"Director and political activist Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found deceased at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday, according to The Hill . This is absolutely devastating news, and the circumstances surrounding their deaths make the tragedy even more shocking. Authorities are investigating the deaths as an “apparent homicide,” according to Capt. Mike Bland with the Los Angeles Police Department. Local medical personnel from the Fire Department responded to the 200 block of South Chadbourne Avenue on Sunday afternoon local time. Officials who arrived at the scene discovered the man, aged about 78, and the woman, aged about 68, dead inside the residence. Reiner was known not just for his incredible films but also for his incredibly outspoken political views. Just this past October, he went on MS NOW and warned that the U.S. was rapidly heading toward autocracy under President Trump. He clearly felt the stakes couldn’t be higher. He insisted that the public needed to be made “absolutely aware that their democracy is being taken from them.” He believed that if democracy was lost, all fundamental rights would be taken away. He said, “We have a year before this country becomes a full-on autocracy completely and democracy completely leaves us.” Reiner also made headlines during the 2024 presidential race Reiner reportedly went after former second gentleman Doug Emhoff during a debate watch party, stating that the U.S. was going to “lose our f***ing democracy due to former President Biden’s rough performance.” That poor performance eventually led to Biden exiting the race, which paved the way for Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee that year. The tragic loss prompted immediate mourning from leading Democratic figures across the country. They celebrated Reiner’s lifelong contributions, arguing his impact extended far beyond Hollywood. Former President Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama expressed how “heartbroken” they were by the loss of the legendary director. Obama wrote that Reiner’s “achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen.” Rob Reiner, iconic Hollywood director and star of 'All in the Family,' dead at 78 https://t.co/pJDWtyICl9 — BombasticallyMe (@Indytruther1) December 15, 2025 The former president noted that beneath all the stories Reiner produced was “a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.” California leaders also weighed in heavily. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he and his wife, Jen, were “heartbroken by the tragic loss.” Newsom called Reiner “the big-hearted genius behind so many of the classic stories we love,” specifically citing The Princess Bride and A Few Good Men . This empathy wasn’t limited to the screen, though. Reiner was a fierce activist across many fronts. Newsom noted he was a passionate advocate for children and civil rights, fighting Big Tobacco, supporting marriage equality, and serving as a powerful voice in early education, which has been under threat with the current administration at the helm . Newsom added that Reiner “made California a better place through his good works.” Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the news “devastating.” She noted that Reiner excelled in every field he pursued. Pelosi highlighted his civic activities, including supporting the First 5 initiative and fighting against Proposition 8 in California. She also called him a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.",2025-12-17T11:45:53.791218,Manodeep Mukherjee,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/politics/the-director-activist-who-raged-about-losing-our-f-ing-democracy-is-found-deceased-with-his-wife-in-a-shocking-discovery/,c1404331ce667e722b9acbdf23b897d91227c8b4,441,en,0.1,"Director and political activist Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found deceased at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday, according to The Hill .

2025-11-25T19:46:51,Review – Syberia Remastered – PlayStation 5,"Is Syberia Remastered worth the adventure or should it be left out in the cold? Syberia Remastered is a well, a remaster of Syberia, the 2002 adventure game from Benoît Sokal of Inspector Canardo comic fame. The game and the entire franchise is developed and published by French creatives Microids. Many many moons ago, back in my youth I can recall seeing the game upon it’s original release and for a reason now lost to time I was unable to play it. So, when the chance to review Syberia Remastered came up I simply couldn’t turn it down. In the alternative world to our own players take on the role of Kate Walker, a New York based lawyer. Kate is sent across the pond to the fictional (although given it’s an alternative universe it’s all fictional) town of Valadilene. Valadilene is famed for it’s automatons and the factory that produces them, the Voralberg factory named after the family that have ran it for generations. Speaking of exploring, lets discuss the games controls. Guiding Kate Walker around the beautiful clockpunk Art Nouveau world is in a word, frustrating. Kate moves so slowly even when holding down sprint, it almost felt torturous. Being a big fancy pants New York lawyer Kate has a deadline but you’d never no this from the manner in which she crawls around. Not only is Kate slow, you’re also required to be exceptionally precise with her movements to interact with objects in the environment. Many a time would I have Kate pirouette on the spot trying to manoeuvre her into place to start a conversation or collect an object I needed to complete a puzzle. Immediately Syberia Remastered felt different, our protagonist Kate, she’s a rather ordinary person, which makes me extraordinary for gaming protagonists. Kate is in Valadilene to finalise the sale of the Voralberg factory. Upon arriving in Valadilene I was immediately struck by how stunning the town looked, not only it’s art design but the visuals in general. I’ve played many remasters over recent years and while most have technically improved upon the visuals none have done so to the degree achieved by Syberia Remastered. Every single environment you traverse looks incredible, character models do clash a little with the rendered backgrounds but are still a marked improvement from 2002. One of two issues I had with the visuals of the game were that Kate Walker looks strangely unrecognisable, which is an odd to thing say given I never played the original, but the nevertheless Kate doesn’t look like Kate. Overall it’s a small issue and is only noticeable when we come to the second visual issue, the cutscenes. The visual overhaul of Syberia is impressive but this isn’t the case when it comes to games cutscenes, they immediately date the game and remind you that it’s 2002, not to mention that Kate looks different to the woman you’ve been exploring this world as. While we’re on the topic of frustration, Syberia Remastered places many things in Kates path on her quest to find the Voralberg heir, namely a plethora of puzzles. Were they frustrating? No, every single puzzle in Syberia Remastered is perfect, they become steadily more difficult as the game progresses but at no point are they obtuse. The most challenging for me personally was crafting a cocktail for a former opera star, and when I discovered the reason I was stuck I felt like a clockwork idiot (it helps to switch machines on). The former opera star for whom Kate and I were required to mix a cocktail before is just one of many memorable characters you’ll meet during your time with Syberia Remastered. One of the first is Oscar, a clockwork automaton who’s is so wonderfully written he possess more humanity than the majority of gaming characters you’ll ever encounter. In fact, almost everyone feels incredibly real, clockwork or flesh and blood I can’t recall the last time I played a game which inhabitants felt quite so real. As always I avoid spoilers in my reviews and Syberia Remastered will be no different in except one way. Originally Syberia was meant to be one massive game, but it was too big so it was split into two titles (hopefully we’ll get a remaster of part 2) and while you certainly get a full narrative and a resolution to all the plot threads the games main through line certainly has a rather abrupt conclusion. Syberia Remastered has essentially two narrative threads, Kates quest to find Hans Voralberg and that of the personal life she left behind in New York. You’ll experience the latter through Kates mobile phone. People will call to check in with Kate and see how things are going, or just for a little chinwag. These folk range from Kates belligerent boss, her eccentric mother and Dan. Dan and Kate are engaged and to be frank and risk breaking my no spoilers rule, he’s a complete and utter tosser. Every single time Kates phone rang I was pleading for it not to be Dan, or her boss, in fact almost every time the phone rang it was annoying, maybe this is just my millennial distaste for phone calls or as I think is more likely it’s a testament to the writing in Syberia Remastered. The main narrative is so compelling that anything distracting from uncovering the mystery at the heart of the Voralberg case was unwelcome. In addition to this, it wasn’t the distraction that was the cause of the distraction that I found tiresome, it was the characters in Kates personal life that I had so little time for, you’ll only meet them through short calls but they were so well realised that they felt like full parts of the adventure, something that will make the games ending all that more satisfying.

2025-11-22T13:19:09,Review – Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth Trilogy (PlayStation 5),"The long awaited trilogy from Arfoire The Hyperdimension Neptunia series has been around for sometime now which started on the PS3 has seen releases on various consoles and is a series that makes light fun and parodies of the gaming industry in real life and other forms of Japanese Culture. The series has also branched off into a manga and light novels, with the sheer amount of games released and sold outside of Japan it is clear the games do have a cult following although the games have seemingly stagnated as of late, still you can’t deny it is a series that is still going strong. Previously available on the PS Vita the Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth Trilogy is now available to PS4 and PS5 users. With all three needing separate purchases is it a steal or another cash grab extraction? In Hyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth1+ you play as Neptune who had been defeated in Gamindustri by the other goddesses and banished from the heavens where she fell and lost her memory. In this low stakes adventure Neptune finds a book which has the collective memories of Gamindustri and is joined by companions IF and Compa embarking on a quest to save the world. What makes the Neptunia series unique as a whole is the uniqueness of each character, no two characters ever feel the same and having a series of games where new characters become a part of the world, their unique traits and constant breaking of the 4th wall makes it an engaging JRPG experience if you understand the jokes and references, while it may not be to everyone’s taste if you understand the references it makes the game more engaging and hilarious. The war in Gamindustri is that of a console war quite literally, the Neptunia series took all the mainline consoles and aligned certain characters to said console while of course changing their names somewhat for copyright reasons, obviously. Various other story elements were actually changed in the game altogether due to licencing issues. Each character takes precedence over certain nations within the world. Leanbox for example is a parody of Xbox, each nation consisting of a Basilicom, a holy organisation that serves each CPU’s nation. Once you regain control of Neptune and set of on the long journey with IF and Compa you find yourself soon battling strange foes and exploring the world, noticeable right away if you did play the original version is the massive change no only to the story but to the interface, the interface is much more vibrant now and certain text elements are much easier to read. While I did not mind the original look and feel of the Rebirth, the developers have now developed it keeping it in line with its sequel and third entry. Rebirth 2 introduces a new cast of characters Nepgear Uni Rom and Ram, these characters being the little sisters of the 4 goddesses who return also are aligned to handheld consoles, Nepgear along with the other CPU little sisters job is to free the older sisters who have been captured, a simple premise but works well and is a great idea and introduction to bringing in new characters and having a background to match with other consoles. Re:birth 3 has Neptune reprising her main role and gets sucked into a parallel dimension where everything has an 80s look, where she meets alternative versions of the other CPU’s and has a focus on the CPU wars of that time, while Neptunia tries to find her way home she attempts to stop the seven sages of the world who are against the CPUs controlling Gamindustri as they always have. While the three games have different premise, they all feel very similar in gameplay, there is a map that has dungeons and towns which can be accessed by selecting where you want to go, each map has certain items and these can be changed by collecting plans or by fulfilling certain requirements and crafting, you can make different more powerful enemies spawn on weaker maps and defeating these early on can really give you an advantage however be prepared for the challenge. Completing quests will also offer quick money and Items to help you on your journey. These systems are completely optional but if you are focused on a full completion of the game and wanting certain achievements then this will be something you will need to look into. Certain metrics will also determine how the game ultimately reaches its conclusion, there is a lot to uncover and with the game requiring several playthroughs if you want to experience everything then the Rebirth trilogy is perfect in terms of replay-ability. The gameplay loop of the Re:Birth trilogy is similar but unique as I’ve not come across too many JRPG’s that use its formula in the same way. While you can play each game without straying from the main path too much the game rewards you if you do, you can grind more powerful weapons early on if you wish and because of how the game is designed you can get an advantage early on, one way of doing this is the rings that give you a massive boost to Health, while enemies may take longer to wear you down having Compa heal means you can regenerate your party to full almost instantly with her magic, this is because her spells are percentage based rather than potency based, this makes fights such as Purple Heart early on who is generally hard to beat now a walk in the park. Gameplay wise there is not too much difference in how battles play out, enemies can be seen on the map and by attacking them on the map you can get an advantage, you can move around within the circle sphere and attack enemies using on screen prompts, you can use a mix of powerful attacks or quick attacks which prioritise more hits against the enemy, the third type of attack focus on lowering the enemies guard and should you break it, following up with powerful and quick attacks usually makes light work of enemies. You can assign chain attacks yourself outside of battle using the menu offering some level of customisation, as CPU’s you can transform into a more powerful state, your appearance changed and this is where a lot of fan service comes in. These transformations are told as part of the story and many fights in the game you will already be in this state anyway but when you are not it is always worth using when you can. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth1+ is the game that has gotten the most polish and that shows out of the trilogy, as the second and third game retain a lot of the textures and original menus only upscaled onto a console it is obvious to see a lot of the blocky shadows and pixelated on screen UI elements, these were originally Vita games so the upscale is very obvious when playing on a bigger monitor, Re:Birth1+ has better detailed character models and a visibly better UI, while it definitely does not look like PS5 quality in terms of graphics, the game running constantly at 60fps is nice and the environments retain some of that PS3 era looking graphics, which is very nostalgic even if you’ve not played the series before, everything loads at hight speed also which is always a bonus. While it has the most polish it lacks certain qualities that the second and third game fixed such as having a party of four as opposed to three. All games come with previously released DLC including character costumes, with a plethora of different costumes that can be found and bought and weapons retaining their visual appearance depending on what is equipped Neptunia Rebirth allows you to make your characters look and play how you want. In conclusion the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth trilogy has been something I have enjoyed playing even if a lot of it feels dated, as a fan of the games in general I have enjoyed revisiting where Neptunia started and comparing it to the most current games that have PS5 only releases. A lot of what makes these games bad, graphics, constant footsteps of your party members is drowned out by the fun gameplay loop, cast of characters and it is always nostalgic to hear Lite Lite and $100 for the billionth time.

2025-11-18T13:49:43,Review – Radiolight (Steam/PC),"If you go down to the woods today… you’re in for a fright Radiolight is a single player first person thriller, developed and published by Kryštof Knesl. Set in the fictional town of Ashwood Creek in 1980’s America, you play as police officer Ethan Collins who is investigating the disappearance of a 14 year old boy in the national park, and the possible disappearance of park ranger Harvey Waters. The game begins at your home. You wander around looking at various items and opening drawers to get used to the controls until you go into your daughter Mia’s room, where she will give you the radio that will become one of your main tools soon enough. After your conversation with Mia you hear the phone ringing downstairs, answering it will send you to the national park on the hunt for Harvey. When you arrive at the visitors centre at the entrance to the park, you notice several things out of place and use your walkie talkie to report to Rob, your colleague. A prompt will appear on screen when you need to report something, usually over the item, but sometimes a speech bubble will appear in the top right of the screen to tell you to get on your walkie talkie. During conversations you will have multiple choices of response, you can only pick one to advance the conversation and there is a limited time to choose. Once you are done looking around the visitors centre, you take the key to the park gate and enter the woods. Radiolight takes place at night and there are no lights in the wood, so you will rely heavily on your flashlight for most of the game, this helps make the world feel much bigger than it is. There is no map or compass to follow, but the game herds you in the right direction with natural barriers and the occasional sign pointing to certain places such as the rangers cabin or an observation point. One area Radiolight excels is in its music, sound effects and its use of quiet environments. At times when wandering the woods, ominous music will start. With the low visibility due to the darkness and concentration of trees, the woods become very creepy, the sound effects make the game feel tense and you expect to jump out of your skin frequently, but the game doesn’t make heavy use of jump scares or gore, so when it does happen make sure you have a helmet on as you will hit the ceiling. I would suggest playing the game with headphones as it really enhances the experience and makes the wood feel alive, it also increases the tension you feel at being alone except for Rob on the other end of the walkie talkie. Speaking of radios, you can walk around with yours on whenever you want and tune it to different stations. There is not much choice of what to listen to but there is a music station which isn’t bad, though I didn’t listen to it much myself as it seemed out of place to me in the setting. At certain points of the game when you tune the radio, the frequency indicator will turn red and a broken voice speaks to you. This voice reminded me of Bumblebee from the Transformers films in the way that it uses male and female voices for different words while speaking, what it says could be taken as a warning or a threat, you will have to find out. The story is very well done, what starts as a regular investigation soon takes a dark turn (no pun intended) towards the supernatural.

2025-11-15T18:32:06,Review – Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted (PS5),"Fresh from the 2010s, Plant vs. Zombies has made its return to the spotlight with Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. Available on PC, PS5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, developers PopCap Games and The Lost Pixels claim that the  Replanted version of the game is “bigger, brighter and crazier than before.” Plants vs. Zombies was all the rage when it was released, even I was a victim of the game’s craze. Fourteen years later, here we are testing the remastered version – the circle of life. Let’s see how this tower defense game stands up against time. The graphics for Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted are good, as would be expected of a remaster. The small cyclical animations used for the game are smooth and well done, maintaining the old school style without seeming clunky. There’s not much to say for the graphics otherwise. The style maintains the simplistic and bright visuals of the original, just in high definition. There’s a fun toggle in the settings to give the plants and/or zombies a retro pixelated style. Completely unnecessary, but a bit of wholesome fun. Audio is the same as the original game, with jazzy little jingles and shooting sound effects. It’s minimalistic and aligned with the original but again, nothing noteworthy. Gameplay was fun, and could be addicting for some. For me, this tower defense style is too repetitive and gets old fast. The nostalgia of the game still made the playthrough entertaining. The gameplay style, however, does feel foreign on a controller, as the mechanisms were designed for mobile, but it is manageable and easy still. Perfect for children, or other adults looking for a hit of nostalgia. There are very few differences between the mobile version of Plants vs. Zombies and Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. This is because, as much as they might advertise “bigger” and “better”, it is still just a remaster. The new version includes cut content which, while not featured on the mobile game, was still accessible through other methods. Multiplayer modes have been ported from early console versions of the game, allowing vs and co-op play too. There are also two additional game modes. Cloudy Days reduces the amount of sunshine/points received and R.I.P mode is a perma-death mode where failing a level resets the player to the beginning, adding difficulty tiers to the game. For those who get addicted to tower defense style games, I can imagine the rage inducing pain of losing R.I.P mode. Overall, Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted was a fun way to pass some time, but nothing special. For those who had a true connection with the original game or love nostalgic games, its worth the time but £17.99 is a steep cost for what was essentially a free mobile game. I won’t judge you if you want to spend the money on an innocent bit of fun, as it it faithful to the original mobile game. However, for myself personally I don’t see it being a game I would return to except out of extreme boredom. The game code for this review was provided by EA .

2025-11-09T20:26:43,Review – Persona 3 Reload (Switch 2),"I Am Thou, Thou Art Entertained Persona is a series that has always fascinated me. A spin off of the Shin Megami Tensei series than has debatably superseded its origins. Persona is an RPG that borrows many of its systems and monsters from it’s parent series. While having dark moments the tone of Persona is typically a  little lighter. With a real focus on the day to day lives of the characters you control. Staying true to turn based game play unlike modern RPG’s, that are increasingly taking an action based route.Persona 3 Reload is a remake that sets out to modernise while retaining its original vision. Initially launched last year on consoles to the praise of critics and players, we will be looking at the upcoming port release for the Switch 2. The narrative follows the protagonist (named by the player) returning to their home city. Upon returning not everything is as it seems. A green light reflected from a moon of equal hue. Motionless upright coffins with a concerning lack of population. Pools and splatters of blood across a lifeless city. This is discovered to be what is known as the dark hour, a 25th hour of the day after midnight that only certain individuals seemingly experience. The protagonist joins S.E.E.S a group who all experience the dark hour and are actively uncovering its mystery.The story is largely unaltered from the original game. Ultimately no changes needed to be made. For the most part it is very well paced, treating you to enough mystery to keep you engaged. The core gameplay loop is split into two very distinct halves, the RPG dungeon crawling and the day to day life simulation. The dungeon crawling largely takes place in Tartarus, a massive ever changing tower that appears each dark hour over the protagonist’s school. Every time you choose to explore it the floor plan will be randomly generated. Offering different layouts, shadows to fight, treasures and most importantly stairs to progress your journey. With 264 floors to conquer you will be spending a lot of time in the eerie halls of Tartarus. In your time climbing Tartarus you will fight a lot of shadows. Persona 3’s turn based combat is truly a joy and a real stand out in the genre. The combat system has been very similar for decades but if its not broke don’t fix it. Each character has an attack and the ability to summon a persona (creatures that cast spells and abilities). If you inflict damage a shadow is weak to they will be stunned and you will get another attacking turn. The system encourages experimentation with each new shadow you fight to try and gain the upper hand. If the player manages to stun all shadows in a battle you can launch an all out attack. This is where your whole team attacks the whole shadow team dealing a high damage output. Although not the most complex battle system in the genre its an incredibly enjoyable one which has aged like a fine wine. Speaking of persona’s during your time in Tartarus you will find more that join your team. The protagonist has the unique ability that he can hot swap his persona’s and abilities in battle. So collecting multiple persona’s to exploit enemies weaknesses in battle is a must. You also have the ability to fuse two persona’s into a stronger one. A very interesting mechanic that keeps you changing and improving your abilities as the game goes on. It nothing new to this series but still to this date is a fresh twist on creature collecting. The other half of the gameplay loop is the life simulation. Persona 3 runs on a day by day calendar system where the player chooses how the protagonist spends their time. After attending school you have two time slots to fill with whatever you desire. After school and evening often have different activities that can progress the story, the protagonist skills or social connections with other characters. Having explorable environments to find activities to fill the protagonists time. All activities or socialising have the chance to improve both the protagonists stats or social links that boost persona’s in battle. Virtually all of them play out in a visual novel style that can be very wordy. Not all of which impact or further the main plot. While I can see that some gamers could get frustrated with the sheer amount of these, I would argue they are well worth your time. Many of the social scenes add so much character and charm to the experience it would be a shame to skip them. The writing is often so great you can’t help but care for these characters which in any other game would be glorified stat trainers. Graphically the game has had an extensive overhaul. Taking clear inspiration from the insanely popular and stylish Persona 5. Highly detailed 3D anime models for the characters. Environments oozing with small details and polish, especially if you can read a bit of Japanese. Not only does it graphically borrow from Persona 5 but also in its user interface as well. Menu’s are beautifully animated with changing 2D anime visuals, adding an ungodly amount of style to what would normally be a mundane stat or inventory menu. Even the UI in battles has had the stylised revamp to. It sounds incredibly shallow but these changes alone make Persona 3 Reload the definitive way to experience this game. Sadly the optimisation for the Switch 2 is below par. Locked at 30FPS with very poor frame pacing makes a beautiful game seem rather janky. With other similarly powered handheld machines on the market being able to play the game a lot smoother and at higher frame rates. With the nature of the game it shouldn’t be a deal breaker if you wish to play it on switch though. Without the need for any precise inputs Persona 3 remains more than playable. It’s just a little disappointing it wasn’t smoother out of the box. Hopefully updates in the future will tighten the performance on what should be a portable must play. The Switch 2 version appears like its going to have all of the console DLC as day one purchases. With Reload being over 18 months old it would have been nice to have the complete package. With all of the costumes and Episode Aigis (Story DLC) its easy to spend the asking price of the base game again for all the content. Saying that Persona 3 is content rich and will easily take up plenty of your spare time as it is. Code Provided By Atlus For Review.

2025-11-06T20:28:56,Arcade Returns in Miniature with the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player,"PAC-MAN has hit the shelves once again, marking another resurgence of the iconic yellow glutton. First making an appearance in 1980, PAC-MAN continues to be a celebrity on the gaming scene. My Arcade has collaborated with Bandai to create a miniaturised version of the classic arcade game. The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is a portable retro arcade machine fitted with a 3.5″ screen and built-in speakers. This machine boasts two game modes and two-player play in one small package. Retro gaming has lasted the test of time and remained popular amongst gamers and hipsters alike, making this a potential hit for collectors. For this review, I combined forces with mum, a 70s baby who lived through the PAC-MAN hype first hand. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● First Impressions First impressions of the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player is the packaging. The packaging is simple and maintains the theme with a simple border design shaped like the machine inside. The classic PAC-MAN logo is featured and small enough that the Joystick Player remains the main focal point. Each package contains a My Arcade Certificate of Authenticity, confirming the product is officially licensed by Bandai. This is a cool little addition, making the Joystick Player seem more valuable. Realistically, there is no serial number attached to the certificate so one could be easily faked to up value knock-offs. Still, the concept is quite fun. Build and Durability The PAC-MAN Joystick Player is incredibly light yet still sturdy. It withstood a good shake and a few (accidental) tumbles. There’s a plastic cover protecting the screen that’s printed with the PAC-MAN game scene. The game  interface is simple – a screen, four buttons, and the joystick. The joystick itself has the familiar clunkiness of a life-size retro arcade machine. It’s sturdy in its socket and feels durable, rather than the cheap tacky plastic most mini machines used. The same can be said of the overall machine. It feels sturdy and well-constructed, like an actual console instead of a mini-machine Nothing but the best for PAC-MAN I suppose. The battery compartment is on the rear of the machine. This PAC-MAN machine takes four AA-battery. I was briefly surprised and annoyed by this, as I expect most electronics to be rechargeable. I then looked down and saw the USB-C port, so this electronic is indeed rechargeable using a wire most people have in possession.  Audio comes from the small speaker just above the battery component. The volume is adjusted using the plus and minus shaped buttons on either side of the power switch. An audio jack is available for sound output. The power switch requires a firm push and makes an audible click, giving it that clunky retro feel. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Performance There isn’t much I can say for performance – it’s PAC-MAN, just miniature. Fans of the original, or of similar retro games, will no doubt enjoy this PAC-MAN Joystick Player. It’s true to original with the gameplay and graphics. The only difference is the pixels are much, much clearer. Players start the game by adding ‘credits’ to the machine before selecting play-mode. I struggled with directing my little PAC-MAN with the joystick, but this was simply a skill issue. Handing the game to my mum, she smashed it. Two-player mode isn’t simultaneous play. With the size of the machine, simultaneous play would be near impossible. Instead, the second player begins when the first player dies and vice versa until all lives are used up. This adds pressure to keep the game out of your friends hands and claim the highest score. Speed Up mode is the same game with added anxiety. Everything remains the same but PAC-MAN picks up speed, flying across the map. Both modes are fun, but if I continued to play on speed-up mode the Joystick Player would also be flying… out the window. Audio comes from one small speaker, giving it a tinny sound reminiscent of retro arcades. This is a nice hit of nostalgia and, similar to real arcades, only fuels the game-induced rage. ● ● ● ● ●🍍🍎🍓🍇● ● ● ● ● Summary Overall, the My Arcade PAC-MAN Joystick Player was a great gadget for nostalgic fun. Its portable size makes it easy to take to parties and gathering for easy entertainment. I also found it to be a great shared experience between myself and my mum, and a way to introduce new generations to the classics. The certificate of authenticity gives it a sense of legitimacy that makes it feel more valuable than just a toy. More importantly, the Joystick Player is sturdy and durable, making it fit for travel or being manhandled by a toddler. I can’t speak for how it performs over time, but so far I’m more than happy with the product.

2025-10-29T18:10:23,Review – Shuten Order (PC),"A Visual Novel Masquerading as an Adventure Game Released September 5th, 2025, Shuten Order (Shuten Kyodan) claims to the be the “ultimate adventure game” on its website. Shuten Order is the collaborative work of Too Kyo Games and DMM Games, with development by Neilo and published by Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd . This collaborative piece had a positive reception, but with time reviews became more mixed. Shuten Order is an outlandish game with bold characters and themes. These complex themes combined with the self-proclaimed five-in-one adventure means expectations for Shuten Order are astronomical. To make this review as impartial as possible, I entered the game with no prior research. The only knowledge of the plot I had was the description given by Steam. Let’s see if Shuten Order can convert us to their ways. Will we pray for the end of the world, or just the end of this game? Shuten Order is a unique story of religious devotion, hereticism, and betrayal. The game begins with a shocking opening scene, as dismembered remains fall from the sky onto a dystopian city. We watch from a distorted perspective as limbs rain down to earth, a single witness looking on with delighted confusion. Thus the prologue begins. We wake as protagonist Rei Shimobe, in a strange hotel room with no memories. With the assistance of two self-proclaimed angels, Rei discovers that they were the Founder of the religious cult – Shuten Order. The same Founder whose fragmented body parts were scattered across the Central Park in the introduction. Revived by divine power, Rei’s current body is only temporary. To complete her resurrection she must complete God’s Trial and solve the her own murder. She has only four days before her temporary body dissolves and she experiences a true death. The suspects? The Ministers of the Shuten Order – the five people with the access, knowledge, and skill to commit the murder. The consequences? In 168 days, the world will end unless she can crack the case. The narrative of Shuten Order is one of the most unique storylines I’ve ever played. It explores themes of theology and fate, as well as agency in organised religion. Despite the complex undertones of morality and misguided virtues, the high-level plot is still riveting and packed with action and humour. A minimum of thirty two hours commitment is required to complete the game (according to How long is Shuten Order? | HowLongToBeat ). I, however, an employed so this was spread out over multiple weeks. For a visual novel game this can get tedious, so patience is required to progress the story. As a player who absolutely loved the narrative and was invested in the outcome, even I had moments of frustration with some scenes. Visual design of the game is stunning. The illustrations are bold and impactful, fully conveying the stakes and emotion of each scene. Characters designs are unique and memorable, their appearances starkly reflecting their personalities. The bright and cheerful colouring is a complete contrast to the story’s themes. This creates a dystopian feeling of forced normalcy in an oppressive society.  Colours are also used for easy distinction of dialogue. Our character’s internal thoughts are written in blue, all spoken dialogue in black, and words spoken with emphasis in orange. Following the prologue, the game branches into five paths – one for each potential suspect. Each suspect comes with a different game system and varying game mechanics. Choosing Inumgi Kishiru, for example, entails a point-and-click detective story where you piece together clues to solve a series of murders. Other game systems include escape rooms and multi-perspective horror. Regardless of the game mechanic, Shuten Order continuously surprised me with the plot twists in each storyline. The absurdity of some situations also made for great entertainment – I would never expect to be held hostage by a VTuber, forced to choose between my moral beliefs and survival. The multiple game systems ensure there will be a style suited to each player. All five paths must be played to complete the story. At a glance, there is no overlap in these stories, however they all align to the overarching plot. ‘Keywords’ are earned by completing specific scenes and objectives, giving important information for deducing the truth of Rei’s death. Keywords are saved and accessible from the menu, which is great because I have terrible memory. Strangely though, the menu is accessed using the tab button, and not escape. I managed to forget this every time I entered the game, leading to much confusion. Actual performance of the game was good. It ran smoothly and I had no problems with the game freezing or crashing. The soundtrack looped almost seamlessly, leaving no awkward silences other than those intended. Controls were straightforward and simple, as expected of a visual novel. Certain actions required not-so quick-time events, which were frustratingly slow. This could arguably be an accessibility design, but I often found myself pressing a key too quick for it to register and subsequently missing the sequence. Overall accessibility for Shuten Order is great. Game settings include text display speed and text skipping, incredibly helpful for customising game pace. Players can also scroll upwards during gameplay to reveal the line-by-line transcript, great for trigger-happy text-skippers. You can also replay audio by selecting any line. Audio is only available in Japanese, however it is a Japanese game so no complaints from me. English translation is available for text. Translation are mostly good, however oddly translated phrases will appear throughout. With the exception of cut-scenes, text will stay on-screen until the player has clicked to move on. This ensures there is no pressure to read at a certain pace to keep up with the game. There are times, however, where the dialogue bubble (and consequently the text) are extended off-screen. Occasionally, there is no text at all other than an ‘x’. Highly inconvenient, sometimes frustrating, but it happens in isolation so players can at least piece together the missing or hidden dialogue from context clues. Ultimately, Shuten Order is not an adventure game. The storyline has themes of adventure and escapades, but I would not label it as anything other than a visual novel. Player participation was limited and not even necessary at some points. I entered the game blind, meaning I can forgive Shuten Order for not meeting the big adventure game expectations. Many players, however, got stuck on the concept of an adventure game and that has limited their ability to enjoy Shuten Order for what it really is – a visual novel. I really enjoyed my playthrough of Shuten Order, largely because of the narrative and visual design. Shuten Order is a game I would recommend to players looking for a low-stakes, low-involvement game to pass time. As much as I liked the game though, I would not consider myself converted. I remain a heretic, but to the game fans out there do not be discouraged by those around you. Blessed be the Shuten Order. The game code for this review was provided by Spike Chunsoft .

2025-10-19T18:22:46,Review – Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Review (PlayStation 5),"A Tactical Recall Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation tactical JRPG based on the Final Fantasy series with some new graphical tweaks among other things and even the option to play the game how it was with still original graphics if that is something you wanted to do. The original game was met with high praise due to its story, strategic gameplay which was new at the time to the Final Fantasy series and many praised it alongside it being a Final Fantasy game, living in the UK meant that the game was alienated to me and at the time Final Fantasy VII was all I knew, we have had the psp port of war of the lions and the Game Boy Advance and a DS game also but these again were a new concept for someone such as myself, Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles however has been lovingly recreated with developers old and new and with some of the creative minds from Creative Studio III working on it you can be sure the team behind Final Fantasy XIV and XVI had some input and it shows and now I can finally play it. The game follows Ramza who is the third son of House Beoulve who finds himself during a conflict where two opposing factions are competing for the throne of the Kingdom of Ivalice, the game remains pretty faithful to the original but not to be confused with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. To begin with there are two game modes, the first allows you to play Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles which is the new updated game with new UI, scripts and voice acting added to the game and trophy support, or you can opt for the game how it was originally which while it does have some QOL features its purpose only serves to tell the story as it was originally, in this mode trophies too also are completely disabled. Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles can does have an overbearing amount of things to dig into although much of this can be likely ignored, firstly there is an encyclopedia which is used as a reference to locations and characters of the world but bigger than that is a feature known as State of the Realm and is something we saw also in Final Fantasy XVI which includes references and details about this story and as it ever evolves it shows key moments to where characters have moved within the narrative. Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles takes place on an overworld map of Ivalice, of course that consists of points and moving to points can initiate a battle or it will be a town where you can re-outfit your companions and also serve as hubs for story progression and side quests. By moving onto a field where enemies exist a battle can take place if you choose to initiate, it is never known what you might come up against as I have entered battles and come away severely on the brink of death and then sometimes I have managed to best all enemies on the field. Although you may be able to dispatch a few enemies it is worth noting the difficulty of Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles remains consistent for a few reasons. For the most part your roster of characters while can be big you are restricted to the amount of characters you can send out on a map once battles take place, while you may only be able to send 5 to 6 units out you may be up against an army of 10 or 11 enemies at a time; also counter in the fact one of your player characters can be permanently removed from the game should they fall in battle and then lose several turns after if they are not revived, then tactics for sure are required to best your enemy. Even if a few enemies are only present at a time on the map, some can be incredibly strong, such as the wild chocobos early on and if you find yourself in a bad spot a chocobo can easily knock a character out in no time at all. While a character may be able to hold out on their own it is very easy to get overwhelmed and the game makes you focus on sticking together. This is mitigated by the fact that battles can be escaped from. With that being said tactics remains an important factor in order to get through the game. Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles features a robust job system where you can align jobs to your characters in order to use  their respective spells and abilities. Using attack and spells on enemies allows you to gain EXP and JP, the latter JP refers to Job Points which are used to learn certain new abilities related to your job, spells can be exceptionally strong and can even interact with the environment, enemy stats and turn orders can be seen as well as the damage is expected to be inflicted so while QOL features are here the game is still on the more difficult side. The job system requires certain pre-requisites before later jobs are unlocked such as getting existing jobs to a certain level, there is a grind associated that can be alleviated by using the fast forward feature during battles, once you do it unlocks some broken combinations, maybe not to the level that a game such as the Disgaea games can perform but experimenting with secondary and passive abilities can certainly unlock some powerful potential. Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles graphically looks great, from the hand drawn intro and portraits along with fantastic voice acting, the character models themselves look a bit washed, the environments however look splendid and while it a definite improvement the game does miss some extra content which was in the PSP version War of the Lions release such as the Dark Knight and Onion Knight, a shame as these jobs could have really made the game that much more engaging but the jobs we have all are great and there is a diverse amount of jobs to tinker around with. Overall I enjoyed my time with Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles and while I might not have a deep love for it as someone who did grow up with the series, I can see why the game has such a following and desire for it, the music is fantastic as you would expect, on thing I can say is I do have a deep love for as much of the music I had heard in my many hours playing FFXIV and hearing a lot of the tracks there a lot which has instilled more of my passion for the game. If you are a newcomer or a veteran Final Fantasy Tactics The Ivalice Chronicles is a fantastic re-imagining of a game that will be beloved by many with many new fans added to the roster.

2025-10-01T15:36:09,FC 26 Xbox Series X Review,"FC 26 excels on the pitch; it’s a near league-winning, title-charging blast. This year, EA Sports made a point of going above and beyond in delivering a unique football experience, distinct from previous entries in the FC/FIFA franchise. Taking on board player feedback, media criticisms, and in-house suggestions, this has led to an unprecedented overhaul of the football sim. With some features being positive and others less so. So, did EA Sports deliver? Or have they talked the talk?? (In my opinion, they’ve delivered). The good stuff is an unrivalled element of authenticity. Licenses, player likeness, kits, sponsors, and commentary teams offer players a very generous amount of real-life likeness unseen in other football sims. As your favourite players exit the tunnels and enter the pitch to the roars of the crowd, the production values are of an incredibly high standard, with stadiums, club anthems, and pre-match visuals providing a genuinely jaw-dropping, realistic experience. If I were to see an FC26 pre-match presentation up the pub on a screen, I’d believe it was a live broadcast game, such is the true-to-life replication. Ultimately, this is where FC 26 excels. FC 26 offers players two ways of enjoying the beautiful game, with one being “authentic” and the other offering a “competitive” gameplay experience. (Authentic is accessible in offline play only). This brand new approach to FC 26 has been EA Sports’ big reveal this year, and they have strived to offer a realistic football sim experience. (Think back to the old PES days, and you’ll have a rough idea of what route EA Sports is going for here). Slow paced, deft touches, with tactical tweaks impacting how the game plays out. As for online, playing Ultimate Team, I felt that In-game defending feels more enhanced than last year. AI (at last) appears improved with significantly better responsiveness. On a personal note, I’m more of a showpony. I love dancing through teams using the 5* skills and trickster playstyle. I’m pleased to say the dribbling system remains effective and very satisfying; it’s a fun alternative approach to try and break through defences. Exploits like the cutbacks and power headers are much less effective. My one criticism of gameplay would be that the long ball option doesn’t come off anywhere near as frequently as it should. Grounded passes with build-up play, holding possession with quick one/two touches, seem considerably more productive. I found this a little frustrating, as game plans can change, particularly if looking for a quick counter, hoof it up the pitch tactic to claw a goal back. Yet, it seems rather pointless as 95% of the time, I found the opposition’s defender would always get to the ball before the attacker. Sadly, it’s some of the smaller, fine margins that hurt the product, such as the pay-to-win model in Ultimate Team and a very ugly user interface. I don’t blame EA Sports for monetising the mode; it brings in huge revenue, so it’s understandable. At the same time, when you’ve got folk forking out £60+ on the game, you’ll always get some saying they shouldn’t have to spend more money (opening packs to acquire a great team) to get the best experience out of the game. In trying to freshen the Ultimate team mode, EA has gone back to the past for inspiration. The return of exclusive silver tournaments, events, and even silver icons offers an interesting spin on a mode riddled with some overpowered gold meta cards that can give a bad player a clear advantage over someone less fortunate to own such a team. Unfortunately, menus are all over the place; it feels like a grind just to find the latest campaign objectives and live events. There’s way too much junk all crammed into the mode (some of it needlessly) in attempts to keep it fresh and players engaged. Another negative to Ultimate Team is the game hacks from the PC network of gamers. For this reason, I’d recommend players have crossplay OFF until patched. Online draft & the live events, such as the gauntlet challenge, are riddled with PC gamers hacking into the server and freezing opponents’ teams to claim an easy win. If there’s a way EA Sports can offer an “Authentic mode” option for Ultimate Team next year, then it would be most welcome. As Ultimate Team is by some margin the mode with the most depth and live updates for those of us looking to dip in regularly throughout the year. Lastly, I’d also like to add that Ultimate Team does NOT have the two gameplay options. This mode is competitive play only. Competitive in UT feels different from last year; gameplay is considerably smoother, animations look improved (gone are the robotic, flat-out weird running animations from previous years), and the game handles more fluidly and cleanly. Visually, it looks as eye-pleasing as it always has. Player models are sharp, showcasing some impressive 4k graphical details with some lifelike facial expressions, strands of hair (such as Cucurella’s mop of locks) sway everywhere as he charges up the left wing, and little blades of grass jump into life as players scurry across the turf, evidently showcasing the impressive detail EA’s Frostbite engine can achieve. As for game modes, FC 26 bangs in screamers after screamers. With a plethora of offerings, gamers are spoilt for choice with offline and online offerings. Nine modes include: Kick off Ultimate Team Manager Career Player Career Clubs Seasons Co-op Seasons Online Frindlies Tournaments (Sadly, no Volta) That’s not even taking into account features such as Rush, UEFA Champions League, and CONMEBOL Libertadores available in these modes. (Fully licensed, I’d like to add.) Manager and Player career modes provide players with an offline experience. Pick a manager/player to utilise, or start afresh with your own customised preference. This sees players’ own journey into the world of football commence. In early editions, these modes would go years with little to no updates. Taking on board player feedback, EA Sports has at least tried hard to inject some life and longevity into the modes. Some tweaks include a more realistic, dynamic weather system, a deeper league simulation structure, fresh animations and cutscenes,  a new decision-making system that includes hiring and sacking staff, and season-based challenges. This sees in-game events and unforeseen situations occur that throw up scenarios for gamers to get through. Injury crisis, clubs in financial ruin, poor time-keeping (this affects match performance), to career-ending injuries. An emphasis on building the youth is vital to combat such scenarios, partaking in the youth tournaments, objectives, and delivering on youth development plans. All contribute to putting the manager mode in a better place today than the stale, tired format it was just a few years ago. It’s not perfect; transfer negotiations can be infuriating when clubs block off further communications for a player without actually naming a price. Leaving you to take up some guessing work. Whilst not quite LMA manager level of depth, it’s a decent alternative to those wanting to avoid the lottery of Ultimate Team. Furthermore, some other features include the returning Archetypes and goalkeeper evolutions. Archetypes provide FC 26 players with a progression system that rewards players with a deep and unique avatar. By earning Archetype exp to boost attribute points, this in turn improves their specific skills to compliment their playstyle to achieve the goal of icon status. There are 13 different classes to archetype with this feature only available in clubs and player career. FC 26 feels like a step in the right direction; it gets more right on the pitch than FC 25, so, more of the same next year, please EA (with added polish, tweaks from feedback, oh, and please add in a few trance bangers to the EA Soundtrack)!.

2025-09-30T20:52:23,Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Review (PlayStation 5),"A Mech-taculous Marvel Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a follow up to the original game originally released on Switch and PC, not having played it I came in unknowingly what to expect apart from fighting in sizeable mech suits. After many hours into the game I can say it has been a positive experience overall, Titan Scion is a hefty game with much to explore over its 30 hour playthrough and although I had not played its prequel I never found myself getting lost in its story. The story begins in space where as a mercenary, your goal is quit simple, escape the tyrannical space station and become one of the resistance group known as the reclaimers, the world which was originally plunged into chaos due to a cataclysmic event was only the beginning, as a member of the resistance you must fight against the Outers aka the opposing faction, the story at times doesn’t always hold its own at times but overall it is not a complete mess, and the voice acting overall is well done. The gameplay of Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is great and easily my favourite part of the game, it is an open world and you are able to fly around collect upgrades and fight other enemies in a world plagued by Immortals and bio-mech beasts, the mechs are quick to dodge allowing for fast and quick movement and precise dodging, gameplay doesn’t initially feel rewarding but the more I played the more I felt accustomed to its mechanics. Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion has a system where if you beat your foe you are rewarded with an item of your choice, this can be a weapon or a piece of armour, while I was not initially on board with this it became one of my favourite systems allowing you to choose and not feel overloaded with gear and not just never feeling like you earned it. It also took me a bit of time to adapt to its controls with being able to lock onto foes and with the way you switch between your loadouts but once you do it is a whole lot of fun. The combat variety is great, you are able to wield long-range guns, sniper rifles and bow and arrows and melee weapons such as giant maces and swords, if you want a faster melee combat then knives and lances are your best option but there is something here for everyone. As the world becomes more explored you will explore new biomes and with this includes new dangers, weather changes and these changed ensure you need to be cautious at times, even some early bosses will destroy you no matter how well you are prepared, these are much higher level constructs that require you to return later (much later!) The bosses you do actually have a chance with and are there to progress the game forward are challenging and fun and you will need to change between your arsenal at times to overpower them and also will at times require you to interact with the environment around you to overcome them. Normal battles aside the bosses in Daemon X Machina are definitely the most fun combat experiences I have had in a game for some time. Traversing the world is fun but not endless. Your mech suits do have energy and by blasting through the world you will find Femto, a mysterious source of energy which your mech eat up like a baby’s first time at McDonalds, while it will drain quite quickly it can be recovered through means of finding it, you are able to traverse in other ways such as a super fast bike or by horseback, but not a horse you would expect but more of a demonic rust horse which is seriously the best way I can describe it, even if it doesn’t feel like it should it’s cool they decided on it as an option. You do have a base of operations as a hub where you can take a break from the action. These base of operations act as customisation stations where you can modify your mech suits, buy new gear and sell loot. More absurd than the previously mentioned horse is the Ice Cream Shop which is bright and colourful, a stark contrast to the dark serious world that Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion resides in, so if you need some buffs for your mech then have some Ice Cream because why not? Positives aside Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion has negatives can be felt in areas, the side missions can feel repetitive at times, while I enjoy the expansive world some people may argue that it is lifeless or empty and I would not disagree, the first biome you come across is a desert and although not completely void of life I understand some might think it does not give a good first impression. There is still much that can be done and some of the later biomes look really fantastic and I think for a game that takes place on a ravaged world the developers have done well to make the world feel alive. If you have come into Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion from playing its prequel I can’t tell you if the game is huge improvement or a total disaster but as someone new to it I do feel like I need to play its prequel as I am now impressed by the game overall. Is it perfect? No, it will not win awards for originality but it is certainly a pretty impressive game by modern standards. A PlayStation 5 Review was provided by Marvelous .

2025-12-16T08:14:20,Halloween is leaving Dead By Daylight,"Dead By Daylight is losing a major licensed franchise. Revealed yesterday , Halloween will be exiting the game on January 19 at 11 a.m. EST/8 a.m. PST. Michael Myers and Laurie Strode will be available for purchase for 50% off until they’re officially removed from the game. Unfortunately, the Haddonfield Map will also exit the game. A detailed FAQ can be found here . A statement from Dead by Daylight reads: Dead by Daylight: Halloween, featuring Michael Myers, Laurie Strode, and Haddonfield, is leaving The Fog. Halloween came to Dead by Daylight in October 2016, marking the first legendary horror film to be added to the game as a license. Its arrival was a historic turning point, the first stone in an avalanche of cinematic horror icons. Yet even the most incredible Halloween night must come to an end. Dead by Daylight is a live service game, and there’s always the possibility that unexpected changes may occur. On January 19th, 2026, 11 AM ET, The Halloween Chapter and all associated content will no longer be available to unlock in Dead by Daylight. For those who already own The Shape, Laurie Strode, and/or any of their Cosmetics, your content will remain accessible to you. If you’re interested in unlocking any Halloween characters or Cosmetics, we’ll be holding a Last Chance 50% off sale until it departs The Fog for good. If you’re reading this and do not own the characters, please note that The Shape and Laurie Strode’s Perks will undergo name changes. They will be added to the General Perk pool and available in the Bloodweb for everyone. Associated Charms and Achievements will be updated to reflect these changes. The Shape’s Perks Save The Best For Last -> Keep Them Waiting Play With Your Food -> See How They Run Dying Light -> Cull The Weak Laurie Strode’s Perks Sole Survivor -> Down To The Last Object of Obsession -> Bound by Obsession Decisive Strike – Will To Live If you already own the characters, Perk names and descriptions will remain unchanged, as well the Perk-related Charms. This departure comes months after Hellraiser was removed from Dead by Daylight . Previously removed franchises Stranger Things and Attack on Titan both made their return to the game, so fans are hoping the same can happen here.

Revealed during Wednesday’s Women-Led Games Showcase: The Game Awards Edition, the game will launch on January 19. A new trailer, which can be seen here , showcases the game in both VR and non-VR action. A synopsis for Ghost Cam reads: In GHOST CAM, you play as a lone paranormal photographer exploring shifting, liminal spaces filled with ghostly traces and hidden secrets. Armed only with a Polaroid-style camera, you’ll capture spirits, uncover spectral remnants, and piece together escape-room-style puzzles to delve deeper into a twisting, haunted dreamscape. Set against a surreal 70s/80s haunted horse girl aesthetic, GHOST CAM invites players into eerie stables, faded childhood memories, and corridors where ghostly hoofbeats linger just out of sight. Not all spirits are hostile; some will watch, some will guide, and some may trap you forever in their world. Your actions shape your Ghost Hunter ranking, unlock hidden mysteries, and determine which of the endings you'll uncover. Inspired by modern psychological horror titles but crafted for a focused solo narrative experience, GHOST CAM delivers chilling atmosphere, emotional tension, and rich replayability. Players can immerse themselves in full VR or on a traditional screen. Steam users can wishlist the game here while Meta VR users can wishlist the game here .

2025-12-12T03:58:07,Bradley the Badger announced from Day 4 Night Studios,"Day 4 Night Studios, which was co-founded by Christian Cantamessa ( Red Dead Redemption, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor ) and Davide Soliani (creative lead on Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, Sparks of Hope, and Rayman in the Phantom Show ), has announced their new action-adventure game at The Game Awards tonight . Bradley the Badger , which will be released on PC (via Steam), merges action-adventure with live-action sequences to deliver what is sure to be a unique experience. Evan Peters ( X-Men, Mare of Easttown, Dahmer, Tron:Ares ) stars as the titular character in both live-action and voice-over work. An announcement trailer can be seen here . Cantamessa said this about the game: “Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them. Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them. From the inner turmoil of self-doubt to the joy of building worlds, we set out to transform those experiences into a game that anyone can get lost in.” Soliani also said: “We wanted to make something that would reignite us, something capable of taking us back in time to when, with younger eyes, the whole world of videogames seemed to shine. And we wanted our mechanics to be the perfect bridge between the past and the future.” A synopsis for Bradley the Badger reads: Bradley, the iconic star of numerous hit platforming games in the past, finds himself lost in strange new lands that, to him, look utterly alien and weirdly unfinished. Longing to return home, Bradley embarks on a journey to save his world and his friends at all costs, even if that means coming face to face with a revelation bigger than anything he ever imagined. At the heart of the game is the Kit. It’s a tool that lets Bradley modify every unfinished asset he can find, just as if he was a game developer. It’s systemic, immediate, and completely transforms the approach to exploration, traversal, puzzles, and combat. Using the Kit and his trusty frying pan, Bradley must navigate worlds that players will find instantly familiar, but littered with unfinished elements. Over the course of the game, Bradley will explore, solve puzzles, defeat bosses, and unravel a broader mystery. Bradley the Badger can be wishlisted on Steam right now here .

2025-12-04T16:27:31,Pathea Games (My Time series) drops reveal trailer for The God Slayer,"Pathea Games, who is best known for the life-sim series My Time , will dive into the world of steampunk fantasy with its new title. Revealed today , open-world RPG The God Slayer is currently in development for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store). A reveal trailer featuring seven minutes of gameplay can be seen here . A synopsis for The God Slayer reads: Long ago, the god‑like Celestials created the human world and all living things in it, designing everything to cultivate a powerful force known as ‘Qi’ to fuel their eternal lives. In this new age, humanity has learned to channel that same qi energy into elemental powers, wielding fire, water, earth, metal and wood through flowing, martial‑artistry. Outraged that their divine energy is being used by mere mortals, the Celestials make a brutal example of humanity by conquering the strongest kingdom in the land in a single night — hunting down and killing the king and the kingdom's Elemancers. An event remembered as the God Fall. In this 40-hour story-driven campaign, players assume the role of one of these gifted Elemancers, Cheng, as he seeks to galvanise a resistance against the merciless Celestials. Imbued with a sense of power and anger at the loss of his own family during the God Fall, Cheng embarks on a journey to change his world, avenge the fallen, and slay the gods that have wronged him. Zifei Wu, founder and creative director at Pathea said this about making a huge shift with their forthcoming title: “Thematically The God Slayer is a big departure from what Pathea is known for, namely the My Time series. However we’ve made multiple open-world RPGs before, filled with beloved characters and varied systems for players to experiment with and flourish. The God Slayer has all that and more with our talented development team attempting something darker and more serious in tone, bolstered by thrilling elemental combat at its core.” The God Slayer can be wishlisted on Steam right now here .

2025-12-15T10:46:30,When The Group Chat Becomes The Betting Slip,"Sports betting is becoming more collaborative as fans share picks, debate odds and place wagers together in group chats and live discussions. This article looks at how digital social habits are shaping modern betting behaviour, from pooled stakes to shared decision-making, and why platforms that reflect this group-driven experience feel increasingly aligned with how people already watch and talk about sport. Sports betting has always been social. Friends have watched matches together, argued over outcomes and hyped up the game for decades. What has changed is where those interactions now happen. Much of the conversation has moved into group chats, shared streams and second screens, where opinions form quickly and reactions spread in real time. Betting follows that shift. Picks are discussed before they are placed, confidence builds through conversation and decisions are shaped collectively. You are responding not only to the odds on the screen, but to the mood and judgement of the group forming around the event. Shared Decisions Are Becoming Part of the Betting Experience More bettors now approach wagering as a group activity rather than an individual one. Friends compare odds, debate likely outcomes and often agree on a shared position before committing funds. In many cases, the wager becomes a collective stake rather than a personal risk. The SpiderBets Sportsbook fits naturally into this behaviour by supporting a sportsbook experience that reflects how fans already discuss sport together in online spaces. The appeal lies in participation. A shared bet carries conversation with it, both before the event starts and while it unfolds. When everyone is invested in the same outcome, reactions feel amplified and the experience becomes more engaging. The bet is no longer just about winning or losing. It becomes part of how the group experiences the match itself. Gaming Culture Shows How Collective Engagement Works This kind of shared participation is not new in digital entertainment. Gaming and esports communities have long treated major moments as collective experiences, with fans reacting together, sharing commentary and building shared memory around key events. Competitive gaming culture has long been shaped by shared viewing, live commentary and moments that become collective reference points within communities. Sports betting is now tapping into the same dynamic. Group chats act as live commentary feeds. Screenshots of odds replace controller inputs. The structure is familiar to anyone who has followed competitive gaming, where the value comes as much from shared reaction as from the outcome itself. Research Confirms the Role of Collective Judgement Academic research supports the idea that betting decisions are increasingly influenced by group interaction. Studies into social betting platforms show that bettors often rely on collective judgement and shared analysis when selecting wagers, particularly when discussion tools are available. Rather than acting independently, participants weigh group sentiment alongside available data. This has practical consequences. When a group agrees on a pick, confidence rises even though the underlying risk remains the same. Decisions feel more considered because they are discussed, challenged and refined through conversation. Betting becomes less about individual instinct and more about shared reasoning. Market Growth Pushes Platforms Toward Social Features The wider sports betting market continues to expand, driven largely by online and mobile participation. Industry analysis shows sustained growth in global sports betting activity, with digital platforms playing a central role in how users place and manage wagers. As competition increases, platforms look beyond odds alone to differentiate their offering. Social features are part of that response. Tools that encourage discussion, shared participation and ongoing engagement help keep users active for longer. When betting feels connected to a broader social experience, it becomes less transactional and more immersive, aligning with how modern fans already consume sport. Betting As Part of the Watch Party For many fans, watching sport now means being connected even when physically apart. Matches are followed alongside live chats, social feeds and messaging threads that run from pre-game speculation through to post-match reaction. Betting fits easily into that environment. A goal sparks messages. Messages reinforce excitement. That momentum often leads to another shared decision. During live matches, that shared momentum becomes especially visible. A missed chance, a controversial call or a sudden shift in form can change the tone of a group conversation within seconds. Opinions are revised, confidence rises or drops and betting decisions adjust in real time. This constant feedback loop keeps people engaged beyond the scoreboard. The match becomes something the group actively navigates together, reacting to events as they happen rather than passively watching them unfold. The result is a form of digital watch party where betting is woven into the experience rather than bolted on. You may be watching alone, but the reactions, opinions and stakes are shared. As sports viewing continues to evolve in this direction, betting platforms that reflect those social habits are likely to feel more natural to the audiences they serve.

Well, welcome to the world of 7440540000, a number that seems to have a personality all its own. Whether you’re looking for clarity on its significance or how it fits into various contexts, we’re here to unveil its mysteries. Buckle up, because we’re diving into the nitty-gritty of this seemingly plain string of digits. What Does 7440540000 Represent? When we first encounter the number 7440540000, it might seem like a random collection of digits. But, it often acts as a unique identifier in various contexts. Primarily, it is a part of the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system, where it typically assists in cataloging books, making them easy to find in libraries and bookstores. Imagine finding your favorite novel among a sea of options without this system, talk about a headache. We might also encounter this number in financial reports, scientific data, or even merchandise tracking, each place showcasing its versatility. 7440540000 Let’s break down 7440540000 into more digestible parts. We can consider it in two segments: the prefix (744) and the remaining digits (0540000). The prefix often gives context to the category of the item being referenced. For example, in ISBNs, the prefix helps identify the language group of the book. Meanwhile, the trailing numbers could provide a unique identifier for specific titles or editions. Think of it as a digital fingerprint, no two numbers are alike, ensuring each book stands out in its own right. This segmentation not only helps with cataloging but also enhances our ease of retrieval, saving us precious time. Applications of 7440540000 in Various Fields The usage of 7440540000 isn’t limited to just books. For instance, in the realm of data management, this number might help in tracking inventory or sales.

It’s impressive how a sequence like this can navigate us through so many industries, isn’t it? Common Misinterpretations of 7440540000 With any long number, misunderstandings can arise. One common misconception about 7440540000 is that it might signify a single, dominant entity when, in fact, it serves diverse purposes across various sectors. People might also think it’s merely a coding error or even disregard it as unimportant, overlooking its practical applications. The importance of context can’t be emphasized enough. Also, some might mistake its significance, thinking it’s a universal identifier when it realistically varies based on industry standards. We must approach these sequences with an analytical mindset, appreciating their specific meanings and significance.

2025-10-07T06:38:37,5 Ways AI 3D Model Generators Are Changing Player-Created Content in Games,"Player-created content has always been a driving force in gaming, giving communities the chance to shape and expand the worlds they love. With AI 3D model generators entering the scene, this creativity is moving faster and reaching more players than ever. We’re seeing quicker asset creation, tools that are easier for beginners to use, new opportunities for personalization, greater creative freedom, and stronger innovation within modding communities. Together, these changes are making game experiences more dynamic, inclusive, and engaging for everyone involved. 1. Faster Asset Creation One of the most noticeable advantages of using an AI 3D model generator is speed. Traditional modeling software often requires weeks of learning and countless hours of practice before a player can produce something usable. With AI, that entire process gets streamlined. A rough idea can be turned into a workable 3D base model in minutes, which lowers the entry barrier dramatically. Players don’t need to master complex sculpting tools to make their vision a reality. That extra time can then go toward refining details, experimenting with design choices, or collaborating with other community members. Faster creation doesn’t just mean more content; it means better content because players can focus on creativity instead of technical roadblocks. 2. Expanded Accessibility Game content creation used to feel exclusive, reserved mainly for players or developers with professional design training or access to expensive tools. AI has changed that by making high-quality 3D modeling more accessible than ever. A beginner with no prior experience can now take an idea and turn it into a detailed object in a fraction of the time. That accessibility is empowering new players to get involved in modding and custom design without feeling intimidated. It also creates more diverse contributions, since people from different backgrounds can bring their own styles and cultural influences into games. 3. Personalization at Scale Players have always loved personalizing their in-game experience, but AI tools take that to another level. Instead of working with a limited set of skins, presets, or customization menus, players can design items that reflect their exact vision. Maybe it’s a weapon with patterns inspired by local art, or a character model built to resemble a specific cultural style. That kind of personalization gives players a sense of ownership over their creations and helps them feel more connected to the worlds they’re shaping. Developers also benefit, since a steady flow of unique, player-generated assets keeps games feeling fresh and evolving. Personalization at this scale ensures communities are always buzzing with new ideas and content that resonates deeply with players. 4. More Creative Freedom for Players AI has unlocked creative freedom that simply wasn’t possible before . Many games have built-in editors, but those often come with heavy restrictions, limiting what players can actually make. With AI, those limits fade away. A player can dream up a fantasy creature, a futuristic building, or even a new style of armor, and see it materialize quickly without specialized training. This freedom encourages experimentation because players don’t feel pressured by the time or technical expertise usually required. It sparks collaboration, too, since people can bounce ideas off one another and build on each other’s creations. Every community becomes more vibrant and dynamic when players are free to imagine without boundaries, and AI tools are making that kind of freedom the new standard. 5. Fueling Innovation in Modding Communities Modding communities have always been a hub of creativity at the heart of gaming communities, but AI is supercharging what players can accomplish together. Complex projects that once took months can now be tackled in weeks, opening the door for more ambitious mods. Players are experimenting with detailed environments, custom story-driven assets, and unique characters that feel almost indistinguishable from developer-made content. This leap in quality and variety keeps communities of strategic games and RPGs alike engaged and often attracts new players to join in. AI is also bridging the gap between casual creators and seasoned modders, allowing more collaboration and knowledge-sharing. As these communities grow and innovate, we’re seeing mods push games into exciting new directions, often extending their lifespan far beyond the original release. Conclusion AI 3D model generators are reshaping how players contribute to their favorite games by making asset creation faster, opening the door to more people, enabling deep personalization, offering greater creative freedom, and pushing modding communities to new heights. These tools are giving players the confidence and resources to build content that once felt out of reach. For developers and communities alike, the result is richer experiences, stronger engagement, and games that evolve in exciting ways long after release.

From old-school websites and goofy YouTube videos, to small amateur games and drag-and-drop music projects—I loved making things. And I loved playing video games. Fifteen years ago, I decided to start a personal blog. At the time, my family was small, but we had a big circle of family friends, and I was tired of repeating the same stories over and over. Facebook was just starting to take off in my area, so I began posting my life experiences there. Eventually, my gaming articles started to get traction, and when I felt comfortable, I switched over to English. That was back in 2013. I loved writing the blog. I met a lot of people, discovered unique games, and even got to know developers while learning about the ins and outs of game creation, release, and translation. But around the summer of last year, something shifted in me. At first I thought it was just burnout—but it went deeper than that. The thing about creative hobbies is that they’re wonderful, but they carry a risk: what once felt like fun can start to feel like an obligation. That’s exactly what happened to me. Instead of enjoying the games I played, I kept thinking, “How can I review this?” That mindset started to dominate everything. I even felt guilty replaying games I had already reviewed—games I genuinely wanted to return to—because I told myself I “needed a new article.” I planned to write two articles a week this summer to get back into the groove, but since June I’ve struggled to write anything or fully enjoy the games I play. And then there’s the plagiarism issue. Over the years, I’ve had my content stolen and copy-pasted onto other blogs —sometimes just for ad revenue, other times with no credit at all. I’ve filed over 150 complaints, and now I’m even seeing sites translate my work and claim it as their own. Honestly, it wears on you. I bet this very article will be copy-pasted somewhere too. I’m not quitting Here’s the thing: I still love writing about games. And I do want to return to it. But right now, it feels too forced. So instead, I’ve been slowly rediscovering gaming for myself again—playing just to play. And you know what? I’m enjoying it. I’m finally breaking out of the mindset of “I need to review this game” or “I need to play this for my readers.” That mindset drained the fun out of everything. I was skipping tutorials, fast-forwarding past slower parts, and dropping games too early just because they didn’t seem review-friendly. Meanwhile, I’ve been juggling a full-time job and other hobbies I really enjoy: translating open-source software into Dutch, streaming with my buddy Klamath, working on a theater group’s website, and most recently—creating AI roleplay chatbots. That last one, honestly, has been my biggest passion this year. Since February 2025, when I made my first serious bot on Moescape.AI, I’ve been hooked. I’ve always loved writing stories and exploring twists on existing ideas, and bots have given me a whole new outlet for that creativity. It’s taught me a lot about pacing, dialogue, and storytelling from different angles. It’s also made me appreciate the art of writing even more. But I’ll stop myself here, otherwise I’ll ramble about that forever. The future So am I quitting writing gaming articles? Yes… and no. I’m putting the blog on the back burner. That means there’ll be long gaps between articles. I won’t stick to a schedule or force myself to publish twice a month. If I play a game and feel like writing about it, I will. If not, that’s okay too. My goal is to rediscover what drew me into this in the first place. Maybe I’ll return to regular writing someday, or maybe I’ll wrap this journey up with a bow. Right now, I’m leaning toward the former—but we’ll see. In the meantime, I want to give space to all the other things I enjoy—streaming, AI art and chatbots, translation, and creative projects outside of gaming articles. Exploring more has helped me appreciate the process of creating again. And honestly, I feel more fulfilled that way. Writing this article feels bittersweet. I had big plans for celebrating 15 years of blogging, but the enjoyment wasn’t there anymore. Instead, I’ll focus on what excites me now. Maybe new gaming articles will pop up here and there—but they won’t be the main focus anymore. If you’d like to keep up with me, you can find me on Bluesky or Twitter , catch me on live streams with Klamath , or check out my Moescape page. Thank you all so much for the support over the years. This journey has been unforgettable, and I’m grateful to everyone who’s read, commented, and encouraged me along the way. I hope to find a better balance moving forward, and I’ll keep you posted. And with that, I’m going to wrap up this article and thank you for reading it. I hope you understand where I’m coming from, and I hope you enjoyed reading it, too. I hope to be able to welcome you in another article, but until then, have a great rest of your day and take care.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.045667,NekoJonez,NekoJonez's Gaming Blog,https://arpegi.wordpress.com/2025/08/17/creative-burnout-and-changes/,d793e92213f26085054a7c50e617d9e09bc635b4,575,en,0.1,"I think this has been coming for a long time.

2025-06-09T13:34:09,Game Quicky: Spirit Hunter – Death Mark: Chapter 7 – Kaerazu’s Amusement Park DLC (Switch) ~ Spooky Park At Night,"Nintendo.com microsite – Fandom wiki entry As someone who has followed and written about every game in the Death Mark series, I’ve been eagerly awaiting any sign of a new installment. So imagine my surprise—and excitement—when, completely out of the blue, a brand-new DLC chapter dropped in April, exclusively for the Nintendo Switch version of the original Death Mark. While it’s a little unexpected that this new content ties into the first game rather than expanding NG or Death Mark II, I’m certainly not complaining. Any return to the eerie world of Spirit Hunter is welcome in my book. But the real question is—does this surprise DLC live up to the haunting legacy of its predecessors, or is it a chapter best left in the dark? Let’s dive in. (Don’t worry—I’ll keep spoilers to a minimum.) Also, feel free to leave your thoughts and/or opinions on this article and/or game in the comment section down below. The good Right out of the gate, the gameplay feels instantly familiar to fans of the original Death Mark . This new chapter seamlessly continues the series’ signature blend of atmospheric horror, point-and-click investigation, and tense spirit encounters. If you enjoyed the structure and pacing of the base game, you’ll feel right at home here. One of the most thoughtful touches is how accessible the DLC is. Despite taking place after the “good” ending of Chapter 6, you don’t need to replay or even finish the entire game to jump into this new story. That accessibility makes it easy for veterans and returning players alike to enjoy the new content without a major time commitment. A particular highlight for me is how the jumpscares are handled. Unlike cheap “boo!” moments found in lesser horror games, the scares here are woven directly into the narrative—something NG also excelled at. These moments aren’t just startling; they serve a purpose in building tension and deepening the story’s unsettling atmosphere. Another welcome feature is the ability to save almost anywhere outside of dialogue, giving you far more control and flexibility—especially useful when the story takes its time. Like in Corpse Party: Blood Drive , dialogue scenes can run long, so it’s wise to save when the chance arises. A charming addition I really appreciated is the ability to talk to your partner at any time with the press of a button. It’s a small detail, but it adds a sense of companionship and immersion, making your partner feel like a constant presence rather than just a narrative tool. I’d love to see this feature expanded in future titles. Visually, the chapter shines. The locations you explore are richly detailed and atmospheric, perfectly capturing the series’ trademark aesthetic. The spirit designs are impressively animated and genuinely unnerving. It’s clear that the development team has taken everything they’ve learned from previous entries and poured it into this new content. The bad That said, the chapter isn’t without its shortcomings. In terms of gameplay, the DLC leans more toward storytelling than exploration or puzzle-solving. If you’re hoping for intricate, brain-teasing puzzles or expansive environments, you might walk away feeling a bit underwhelmed. It’s not that the puzzles are bad—they’re just few and far between. This chapter is clearly more focused on delivering a compelling narrative rather than challenging gameplay mechanics. For some, that’s a fair trade. For others, it may feel like a missed opportunity. Clocking in at about 3 to 4 hours, the chapter is relatively short. And while the writing is strong, I did find myself wishing for a little more build-up and complexity to the mystery. Compared to the standout Red Riding Hood chapter that came before, this new installment doesn’t delve quite as deeply into its haunting themes. Of course, I could just be a bit over-eager, having waited so long for new content—I’ll admit my expectations were sky-high. Conclusion Despite its brevity, I had a great time with this new chapter. It’s always a pleasure to revisit the dark, fascinating world of Spirit Hunter , and this DLC feels like a love letter to longtime fans of the series. I do wish the chapter was available on more platforms—Steam players in particular are missing out—but I’m still grateful it was released at all. Compared to the somewhat disappointing extra chapter in Death Mark II , this one is a clear step up. Short but impactful, I’d place it on par with Chapter 3: Hanayome from the original game—concise, emotionally resonant, and haunting in all the right ways. If you’re a fan of the series, this DLC is absolutely worth playing. While it may not redefine the franchise or offer a ton of new gameplay innovations, it’s a welcome return to familiar horrors—with just enough new polish to leave you hoping for more. Here’s hoping this is just the beginning of a Spirit Hunter revival. My appetite for ghost stories, twisted mysteries, and eerie atmosphere is far from satisfied. I know this was a rather short article, but I have said everything I wanted to say about this chapter. I’m planning to stream it with Klamath later this year. So, keep your eye on the YouTube channel . And now it’s time to close off my article. Thank you so much for reading this article and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope to be able to welcome you in another one, but until then… Take care and have a great rest of your day.

2025-05-03T14:32:51,"Casual Game Banaza – Tropix, Sally Salon, Fiber Twig & Shopmania","Sometimes I enjoy playing games that are just perfect to relax. And since I was a bit under the weather lately, I needed an amazing casual game to play. So, in today’s article, I’m going to give a quick overview of some casual games I played during my time under the weather. Maybe I’ll do a more in depth review of these games later, but now… I quickly want to touch upon them. If you know any great casual games I should try, give me a comment on this article, and who knows… Maybe in the next article, they will appear. But, you can also leave a comment with your thoughts and/or opinions on the content of this article and/or the games. Tropix … Your Island Getaway Official website – IGN page In Tropix… Your Island Getaway, you have to play several classic mini-games like a bubble popper, mahjong, blowing, a word making game, Sudoku… You earn sand dollars to decorate your island. If you fill up the fun, comfort and food bars, you can go on the next island and unlock more mini-games. I used to play this game quite a lot when I was a child, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. My sister and I tried to be the fastest to finish a mini-game set or get the highest score. I recently rediscovered this game. It’s a great one to quickly play a few rounds of the mini-games and the theming of your island getaway is very nicely done. While writing this article, I have discovered there is a sequel to this game. I’ll for sure try out that game and maybe mention it in another article. But, if you enjoy solid mini-game collections that are quite relaxing and charmingly made, I’d highly recommend to give Tropix … Your Island Getaway a try. I recently also bought a Nintendo DS copy, and I’m comparing it to the PC version. And that sounds like a fun future article so hold tight. Sally Salon Gamehouse wiki – Bigfish games A big subgenre in the casual game scene are the time management games. One of my favorite time management games is Sally’s Salon. In this game, you run your own beauty salon, and you have to make your clicks matter. Since, the order matters. It’s both a management sim and a puzzle. The further you get in this game, the more hectic this game becomes. This screenshot explains quite a lot of the basic mechanics of the game. You have to move your clients to the right stations and preform the action at the set station. The faster you guide them through the salon, the higher their pay at the end will be. Also, you can earn back hearts by choosing the things they like. You lose them, by choosing the things they dislike or letting wait for too long. Also, you can hire staff with your profit to automate some tasks since otherwise it really get hectic in the later levels. This game can become a bit repetitive in long play sessions. The PC version can also be very picky with hitboxes. But overall, it’s pretty fun. The sequels are a lot of fun too. I have played Sally’s Spa and Sally’s Studio. The other games in the series I haven’t played. Fiber Twig Bigfish – RealAracade Wiki There are a lot of casual games where you need to fill in a certain shape and don’t let the conveyor belt at the bottom get filled. But Fiber Twig does a unique twist on the genre. In this game, you have to connect tree branches, and you can only continue if the light energy doesn’t escape. This game is a true puzzle game. It’s also a high risk/reward game. Since, you can’t see the rest of the level. So, is it wise to save certain pieces, or should you use them right now? Also, power ups are quite rare. So, undoing mistakes or filling in dead ends… Use your power ups wisely. It’s a game that looks boring if you only judge it on the screenshots, but it gets quite intense and enjoyable to play. The charming theming and lore give this game a unique quirk that gets my hooked very time I boot the game up. Shopmania Bigfish games page Shopmania is also a game like Fiber Twig, where you have to place all the items from the belt to the playing field. But the twist in this game is that you have to keep things like color, shapes and other things in mind. The idea is, that you work for a super mega store to buy medicine for your sick hamster. And in this store, the employees shop for you. So, you have to fill the customers their carts. If you fill the cart with the item that the customer is thinking off, you get bonus cash. If you fully fill the cart, bonus cash. All items the same color? Well, bonus cash of course. The more profit a certain line brings, the more you can upgrade for a bigger cart. This brings in more money but also more risk. Since, it gets tricker to get those combos and bonuses going to reach the higher and higher quota. Oh, and three items going into the shredder, and it’s game over for that level. The story is quite silly and I love the theming. Even just writing about this, I hear the sound effects of this game in my head. Final thoughts Honestly, playing these casual games while I was under the weather felt like reconnecting with a simpler time. Whether it was racing my sister in Tropix , strategizing my way through Sally’s Salon , getting absorbed in the puzzles of Fiber Twig , or smiling at the quirky humor in Shopmania , each game brought back a small but meaningful spark. It reminded me that sometimes, it’s okay to slow down and just enjoy a bit of playful chaos or quiet thinking. I could go on for quite a while about other relaxing games I’ve discovered over the years—but I’ll save that for another article. Who knows, maybe the sequel to Tropix will make an appearance next time. Thank you for reading and spending this little slice of time with me. If you have your own favorite casual games or thoughts to share, feel free to leave a comment. I always enjoy hearing what others are playing. Until next time—take care, and may your sand dollars stack high and your cart combos never break. And with that said, thank you so much for reading this article. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I look forward to welcoming you back in a future article. Until then, have a wonderful rest of your day, and take care.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.050626,NekoJonez,NekoJonez's Gaming Blog,https://arpegi.wordpress.com/2025/05/03/casual-game-banaza-tropix-sally-salon-fiber-twig-shopmania/,d363de7e212c9283705b6f43b12f305451dcadcc,577,en,0.1,"Sometimes I enjoy playing games that are just perfect to relax.

2025-03-16T13:08:09,My favorite gaming music #30 ~ Favorite background tunes for work and writing,"Previous entry in the series Sometimes, I like to talk about other aspects in the life of a gamer. One of those things is game music. While I am not an expert in music theory, I find music a very important part of the experience. Also, music helps me focus during my day job and other hobbies as well. Recently, I found out that I often listen to certain tracks in certain contexts. I had an idea. Let’s write about that as the special for my 30th article. This article will be about my favorite video game tracks. So, this article will be very different from other articles in the series. But, I think it’s a fitting way to celebrate reaching 30 articles in this series. I hope to share some interesting music with you all. If you have interesting soundtracks you listen to at certain points, please share them in the comments. I am curious to hear them. Of course, feel free to leave a comment with your thoughts and opinions on the article and/or the chosen tracks. Persona 5 Royal – During work Information of the Megami Tensei wiki I often listen to one soundtrack ever since I started playing the game. It has to be Persona 5 Royal . Before I played any Persona game, I heard quite a lot about it and how much the praises were sung. And when I was able to play the game, it didn’t disappoint at all. The writing, pacing and gameplay. It all clicked with me. It’s an energetic jazz soundtrack. Likewise, it gets you hyped in at the right moments. It also puts some swung in the game. The soundtrack hits all the right moments and adds so much to the atmosphere of the game. I place the soundtrack of this game on repeat more often than I care to admit, actually. Some days, I only listen to Persona 5 Royal soundtracks. I also enjoy the spin-offs like Persona 5 Strikers and Persona Q . Cult of the Lamb – Writing Info on the Cult of the Lamb wiki When I’m writing more general articles, I often play the game’s soundtrack. This helps me get in the mood of that game again. It makes me remember the game even more. Since, I have a very associative memory when it comes to writing game reviews. Not every game has a long soundtrack. Writing sometimes takes a few hours to finish an article. I find myself going to the soundtrack of Cult of the Lamb by Riverboy. It has the perfect mixture of more calm, chill, and relaxing tracks. It also has the more intense tracks for when you are in a dungeon or fighting a boss. For some reason, and I can’t explain why, while I’m listing to this soundtrack outside the game… I find myself in the perfect trance to write. So, I think, that this soundtrack is an indoctrination tool to join the cult of that lamb. Or maybe not, maybe I’m just making a silly joke here. Right? Story creation I started to mess around with AI chatbots and AI art. Since then, I found an amazing outlet for all the stories I want to write. This also allows me to try to create them. While I still have a lot to learn to create the great bots, I’m learning by trail and error. I also have some fellow creators and players who give me advice and support. It’s a very welcoming community, and I’m loving every part of it. My favorite platform is MoeScape. If you want to see what I created, feel free to take a look on my profile . But outside of bot creation, I also interact with a ton of bots. I try out certain scenarios to challenge my writing skills. It also serves as an outlet for my love of writing stories. Of course, I listen a lot of music while I’m writing certain types of scenes. When I’m writing a scene of loss, grief, or sadness, I nearly always listen to the farewell themes. They are from the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series. I have played through all those games. I have to tell you, the moments where these themes play hit HARD. This brings my head space back to the memories I had while playing the games. And those memories help me improve my writing. Maybe it’s an illusion I tell myself. I tend to remember the sadness heavy arcs I write better when I’m listening to these tracks. Another strong track I listen to while writing more emotional breaking scenes is from the Nonary games . The track Blue Bird Lamentation kicks you in the emotional balls when you are not ready for it. I especially love the remake they did in the final game of the trilogy, Zero Time Dilemma . It has a bit more umph as they said to the still strong original. Speaking of the Nonary games , the soundtrack of all three of those games is a chef’s kiss. I use it when I’m writing more tense and/or horror scenes. Shinji Hosoe knocked it out of the park with the soundtracks of all three games. It adds a more creepy vibe for when I’m writing the more tense moments. While soundtracks like the ones in Silent Hill could also work, those games fit a very specific style of horror. I feel that the Zero Escape trilogy gives you a bit more range with its soundtracks. This is not to say that Silent Hill has a bad soundtrack, heavens no. For my writing style, the soundtrack of the Zero Escape series hits harder. It gives me more flexibility. And maybe I’m biased since I played more of the Zero Escape games than Silent Hill games. Highly possible. In case you want to listen to the soundtracks, here is a link to a playlist . It features Zero Time Dilemma’s soundtrack. There is also 999: 9 Hours, 9 People, 9 Doors soundtrack . And of course, Virtue’s Last Reward soundtrack . There is also a more general soundtrack I listen to during writing. I use it while interacting with AI-chatbots. That’s the one from Monster Tale . This old classic DS game, was a unique metroidvania. In Monster Tale , you had to not only get stronger yourself. But you also had to raise your monster to help you fight. You had to decide your monster companion’s role. Your companion could help you fight and solve puzzles on the top screen. They could also eliminate treats and enemies on the bottom touch screen. The soundtrack of this game is excellent. It is a great choice if you are traveling through an unfamiliar world in the story you are crafting. And maybe, I’m being a silly hopeful fan that the remake is coming. But after almost 10 years of radio silence, I don’t think it will see the light of day. Now, let’s not pretend that everybody who has played more than one Ace Attorney … doesn’t listen to the court themes like the Pursuit themes . And then, they imagine how it would feel to break down a criminal or liar. This happens while that glorious music is playing. And yes, when I’m playing more human characters with some bots, it often goes into a confrontation. You bet your sweet behind I’m playing part of the Ace Attorney soundtrack. I love using themes like the suspense themes or the Tell The Truth themes . Ever since we got the “The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles”, we’ve enjoyed amazing investigation themes. We also enjoyed deduction themes with the Joint Reasoning / Dance of Deduction . The type of story I’m writing affects the adventure. The bot I’m using also influences it. I sometimes go on adventures like you would have in Etrian Odyssey . An amazing game series that started on the Nintendo DS. It’s a dungeon crawler RPG where you have to draw your own map on the touch screen. I’m glad that Etrian Odyssey got a port to modern consoles and even PC . These are amazingly charming games. The music is addictive and really fits the atmosphere. It works for me while I’m writing exploration scenes and cosy camping nighttime scenes. The battle themes are also quite nice for the fighting scenes. Now, sometimes I also play a more modern western bot. And western, as in the good old American western with the cowboys. And then the amazing soundtrack by Clint Bajakian of the western shooter Outlaws is perfect. It’s also an amazing excuse to talk about the amazing game Outlaws . An amazing and addictive shooter was released in 1997. It brought amazing titles like Loom, The Secret of Monkey Island , and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. It’s an amazing shooter where you have to reload each bullet yourself and know when to reload. Since, the higher the difficult, the more unforgiving this game becomes. I linked my review higher, so if you want to know more about this game, give it a read. Conclusion I could write for a long while about the soundtracks I listen to at work. I enjoy them during hobbies and while coding. They accompany me while interacting with or creating bots, as well as preparing for a live stream… Like the soundtracks of the Castlevania games on Nintendo DS. Also, don’t get me started on the use of some tracks of the Legend of Zelda series, like Gerudo’s Valley . Oh, when I’m chatting with a bot about the past, the theme song of Time Hollow inevitably comes up. When the line “wish we can change the past” appears, I somehow try to weave it into the story. But, I’m going to stop myself here and keep other soundtracks for later. Otherwise, this article becomes a bit too long. I might keep this subject for the next celebration article in this series. To be honest, it was a fun way. It allowed me to look back at the games I have reviewed. I’ve also talked about them over the past 15 years of writing this blog. Fifteen years of writing a blog. I deleted and rebranded my old Dutch lifestyle blog from 2010 till 2013. However, I have been writing about games since the very start. This blog is an amazing timeline and look back to all my adventures in my life. And the music associated with those games bring back so many memories. And thankfulness to everybody reading and interacting with my blog. I hope you enjoyed today’s article and also the sneaky look back to past articles. I can’t help myself. One final amazing OST I listen to while I’m coding is the one of Stella Glow . With that said, I want to thank you so much for reading this article. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope to welcome you in a future article. Until then, have a great rest of your day.

2025-03-02T16:39:49,Game Quicky – Balatro (PC – Steam) ~ Running Poker Multipliers,"Steam store – Official website – Wikipedia page Sometimes, it’s the simple games that entertain me for hours. Who thought that a new spin on playing Poker could be so refreshing? It even wins several awards at the game awards 2024 . Now, my good streaming buddy Klamath bought me this game for my birthday. I decided to give it a go, and I was surprised. In this article, I want to share my honest first impression. I will also discuss what I like about this game. Additionally, I will mention what I don’t like about the game. I have played Balatro on my PC. But, if this game looks interesting to you, feel free to discover it on other platforms like mobile and consoles. Before I dive into this card game, please leave a comment with your thoughts. Share your opinions on this game or the content of this article. The good The visual presentation and style of this game is something that blew me away. Visually, this game looks amazing. The subtle animations of the cards, the way the UI hints pop up, the little hints on the planet cards… The UI offers something nice during boss fights. It gives you hints when a hand isn’t going to score. But there are other little things in this game that are just fun. Like, you can click and drag the bind chip while you are thinking of a next move. The gist of this game is quite simple. You have to play poker hands from the cards that you are given. You don’t always have to play 5 cards, in case you want to keep a certain card. Each ante has 3 rounds. A small and big blind and a boss fight. Each time, the goal of chips you need to earn raises. In between each blind, you earn money. This money, you can use to buy from a shop where a few joker or other special cards are offered. These cards add multipliers to certain hands. This is a list of examples: The chip’s multiplier doubles. This only happens if you have spades and clubs left in your hand. The gained points for a played and scored ace doubles. Gain 2 extra chips per card left in your deck after playing each hand. Some of these Joker cards can be a lifesaver. Especially the free chips ones. Others, force you into a certain playstyle. Each time you hit the shop, it’s a difficult decision. Should I continue with this set of Jokers, or should I replace one? You only have 5 slots. Changing one out might increase your points just enough to survive another round. This game is the perfect blend of strategy and luck. You need to get lucky with the cards and not use up all your discards quickly. Since, you don’t get them back easily. The rougelite elements in this game give the usual poker game should a fresh spin. How far do you get with all the jokers and how high will you score? Since, it doesn’t matter if you survive a round just barely. Survival is survival, and maybe then you can buy a new joker card that elevates your run. You restart with zero points and new hand and full deck each round anyway. Or you can gamble it all and skip a round for an interesting bonus. And if you loose, you reset to the start of the game for a whole clean run. Once this game clicked, it became the perfect “one more run” game. Betting with myself how far I would get this time. This game is quite responsive. In terms of controls, this game is quite easy to control. The UI is perfect as well. I’m also glad that there are various accessibility options in the game. Things like reduced motion and high contrast cards are important. The more people can play the game, the better. The save system is easy to use. You can just exit the game and restart from where you left off with ease. Also, there are three player profiles. You can also name the profiles, so you easily know which profile is which. Not to mention, you can unlock everything, but then you won’t be able to go for those sweet Steam achievements. The bad If you are unfamiliar with the rules of poker, you might be in trouble. Thankfully, the valid poker hands don’t take a long time to learn. You also have the “run info” button to help you. In game, you don’t get too many lessons on making valid poker hands, so keep that in mind. Now, this is a difficult one to write. While the music in this game is amazing, the track variety is something of a mixed bag. Some of the tracks use the same sound font and melody. Sometimes, I don’t recognize that the pitch and instruments had changed. Don’t get me wrong, the soundtrack in this game is pretty good, but more variety would have been welcome. A few more ambient tracks would do the trick. Now, this is a major nitpick. To be honest, it only bothered me when I started to pay attention to it. The small tutorial at the start of your first game is extremely helpful at explaining things. Yet, some information will be only told once in that tutorial. So, if you put the game down for a while and don’t remember everything… You have no real way to re-read the rules. Thankfully, most (if not all) concepts in this game aren’t hard to grasp. But a small refresher like having the option to replay the tutorial wouldn’t hurt. If I may give an extreme nitpick, I think it will be this. In this game, you can modify the picture cards with references to different games. Now, this is per suit and each suit has a different set of games. I wish this was a fleshed out a bit further. Like, I love the art for Cult of the Lamb and Slay the Princess. But only having those face cards in one suit be changed, it didn’t scratch the itch enough for me. Maybe using smaller images on the number cards of the suit would make it even more enjoyable. Then again, how could you do this? It would require massive development time and designing a whole card deck per reference. So, I can totally see why the developers made this choice. The conclusion In the end, Balatro is a fantastic blend of strategy. It has elements of luck and engaging roguelite mechanics. These features keep me coming back for “just one more run.” Its polished visuals, clever gameplay twists, and thoughtful accessibility options make it a standout experience. The game has a few minor drawbacks. These include the limited tutorial recall, the music’s slight repetitiveness, and the poker learning curve. Despite these, the issues don’t overshadow the sheer enjoyment this game offers. If you want a new take on poker, try Balatro. It challenges your planning skills and keeps the stakes high. I’m happy that Klamath gave me this game for my birthday. It took me quite the while to actually give this game a shot, but I’m happy that I did. I can easily play this game during short downtimes. It’s easy to pick up and play. I also think that this game might be even more fun on a tablet or on the go. During long play times, it can become repetitive. However, this is oh, so fun in short bursts. It’s also exciting if you are able to string together a long combo or run. I want to congratulate the team behind this game. LocalThunk and Playstack, you made an awesome card game. It has a unique spin that makes me come back for more. The praise and awards are totally deserved. I am eager to delve deeper into the game. I am excited to discover what else some jokers I haven’t discovered yet may have in store for me. And with that, I want to thank you all for reading this article. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope to welcome you in a future article. Until then, have a great rest of your day and take care.

2025-02-02T16:12:47,Game Quicky: Everloop (PC – Steam) ~ Did This Happen?,"Steam store page – Developers link You walk in a corridor and after turning the corner and see an altar and 8 candles above it. Then you turn the corner again and you see the same corridor again. You remember the note. If something looks off in the exact copy of the corridor, you need to return to the start. Then walk the other way. Otherwise, you have to continue walking through the Everloop. Will you manage to escape the looping corridor and understand its mysteries? Well, that’s what we are going to discover in this game quicky article. I invite you to leave a comment down below. Share your thoughts and/or opinions on this game or the content of this article. The good The gameplay of Everloop is very simple. It’s basically spot the difference. You have to walk through the same corridor and check if something changed or not. These changes can be subtle, like a change in a painting or a book on a table changing color. Or these changes can be drastic and obvious, like totally different lighting. Only one change can be activate at one time, and it’s unsure if a change happened or not. In case of a change, you have to turn back and walk in the other direction. In case there is no change, you have to keep walking forwards. Before the altar is the cut-off point. If you judged right, a new candle will be lit. If you make a mistake and miss a change, all your candles will be blown out. If you claim something changed and nothing has, you start over. The idea is that you have 8 rounds without a mistake in a row. Now, it’s always random if a corridor has a change or not. So, you need to check it all, and it becomes a paranoia guessing game if something has changed or not. Since, you start to doubt yourself. Have the titles always looked like that? Has the cat suddenly changed color? Since, when you fail, you don’t get any feedback why you failed. It can be because there was a change you didn’t notice. Or, you mistakenly said that an unchanged corridor had a change while it hadn’t. The amazing thing is, when you correctly identified a change, you unlock a small lore description in the codex. You can only see this description in the main menu. The descriptions are written amazingly. They were a lot of fun to read through. The game maintains a tradition in this genre. It doesn’t show you duplicate changes unless you have beaten them all. You beat a change when you find it correctly and walk back from where you came. Then the change will be taken out of the pool that change show up. After finding all the possible changes and beating them, the game resets them. It throws them all back in the possibility pool. The atmosphere in this game is very nicely done. I loved the visuals, and some changes were extremely sneaky to find. Like, one of the fans can be spinning in the opposite direction. I highly recommend avoiding the “all anomalies guide” in the Steam discussions. Reading it takes a lot of the fun away. The controls in this game are a blast. They are responsive, and I could look in the corridor with ease. I can go in extreme nitpick mode. The tutorial prompt in the left corner shows WASD. I have an AZERTY keyboard, and it doesn’t adjust. But then I would be missing the point a bit. Since, you can play this game using a controller. And I don’t know what I liked more, the keyboard or the controller. Man, it this movement in this game snappy and perfectly tuned. But if I’m allowed to say, one more extreme nitpick. The tutorial shows that the “R” trigger is set to run, but the “L” trigger works as well. The negative Now, in this game, you don’t really have chaser changes. Unlike in other similar games in this style , you don’t have changes that if you touch them, end your run. This is something I feel mixed about. At one hand, it’s amazing to not have your run be ended out of nowhere. But on the other hand, it takes away some tension this game can have. This is a nitpick, but the game doesn’t show you a number on how many changes still haven’t been discovered. But, you can easily calculate that by looking in the codex on the main menu. Some people might find this a negative aspect of the game. But, I totally understand why the game works this way. When you exit the game and go back in it, you start from zero in your loop. So, keep that in mind if you think that the game saves your round progress. You will notice all anomalies that this game offers. After beating the game, there isn’t much replay value. This negative isn’t big. This game is only €5. Still, I rather mention it in the negatives section. Some people find it important that there is replay value in their games. But, I personally don’t mind it since it’s a lovely small experience that is a blast to play through. The biggest negative is that there is no easy way to reset your progress. To do that, you have to remove your save file and turn off Steam Save Cloud syncing. In various other games in this genre, there is an easy choice in the options’ menu to make that happen. Conclusion This is a small, bite sized game created by a small team of four people. You can finish this game completely in, gave or take 2 hours. The Exit 8 set the standard for the games in this genre. As a result, the market has been flooded with a ton of games in this style. Shinkansen 0 , Dead end Exit 8 , Project 13 to name just a few. And I find that Everloop should be in the list of the better titles. It feels like a lot of love and care has been put into this game. Especially the codex with the small blurbs. It makes various things sound bigger and more dangerous than they actually are. It’s an amazing touch that Infinity Green Game Studio added. If you want a small game made in Unity, I highly recommend this one. It is a nice spin on Exit 8 with a more Brazilian twist. I enjoyed my time with this game so much. I even placed it on the long list of my top 10 games I played in 2024 . And with that said, I have said everything I wanted to say about this game. I am curious to see if any of you give it a try. If you do, feel free to drop a comment with your thoughts and opinions. Well, I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope to welcome you in another article. Until then, have a great rest of your day. Take care.

2024-12-30T21:46:08,Game History – Tomb Raider On The GameBoy,"When I was younger, I was always convinced that the first Tomb Raider game got a sort of remake on the Game Boy Color. It makes a lot of sense in my mind, since the title of the game was Tomb Raider. And in the same time period, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine also got a port to the Game Boy Color. That game was an interesting remake in 2D. Now, we are not here to discuss an Indiana Jones game, so let us focus on the Tomb Raider games. I do not always do research before I start playing a game. This game is one perfect example. I just started the game up, expecting the story starting with a rendition of the Ice Caves. But, to my surprise, the game started up different. The actual subtitle of the game is The Nightmare Stone. On the box-art, we just got Tomb Raider as a title. On the box-art, we see that Lara is running away from an erupting volcano and behind her, you see several skeleton enemies. The bottom section is reserved for company logo’s like Eidos, Core Dynamics, the licensor Nintendo, and the publisher THQ. We also got the “Only on Game Boy Color” triangle in the left corner. The game was released in June 2000. On June 7th, North America, Europe got it on June 28th and the UK two days later. Only Australia got the game a little bit later. Their version got released on July 18th. Nowhere on the box-art, the game got the subtitle The Nightmare Stone. The game just released as “Tomb Raider” in North America and released as “Tomb Raider: starring Lara Croft” in all other regions. This is a practice also done with the other Tomb Raider games. It would have been easier if they just added the subtitle, to make conversation easier. The critics gave Lara Croft is first entry on the Game Boy Color very high praise. Various gaming magazines and websites gave this title 8 or 9 out of ten. The average score of this title is 79% on the aggregator GameRankings. One of the lowest scores I could find was by a German magazine named 64 Power in their June issue, giving it a three out of 5 or 60%. Since Core Design developed this game, it will not be a surprise that you find a lot of developers on this game also worked on the main Tomb Raider games. This game was developed by people who knew how a Tomb Raider game should play. In this title, Lara is hunting after the Nightmare Stone. This stone is in possession of a treasure hunting group who wants to use it to release the evil god Quaxet, a factious god in the Mayan mythology. Playing through this game, you really want to play through a Tomb Raider game. Of course, there are some big differences since the game got released on a handheld. The most obvious difference is that the game is in 2D. There were only a handful of 3D Game Boy games, and most of them did not involve jumping. Another significant difference with the main line Tomb Raider games is that this game plays a lot slower. The controls are more limited on the Game Boy Color, and more action-packed gameplay could not really be implemented, per se without it becoming really clunky. Speaking about the controls, it takes some time to get used to. I mostly played platformers or adventure games on the Game Boy, and I was so used to push the A button to make my character jump. But Lara jumps with the up arrow in this game. Not only that, if you want to climb up ledges, you need to hold B. Which is the button you use to run. If you are moving left or right and press B, Lara starts running. When Lara is running, and you press the jump button, Lara jumps in the direction she is running. This gives you a hint how to jump a gap when standing still. You have to press B first before the jump button to jump over a gap. This control scheme is quite ambitious since there is no real tutorial in game explaining the controls. You do not have a training or testing level in Lara’s home. The manual explains these things quite well, but if you bought your copy today from a garage sale without the manual, I would advise you to look for it online. The control scheme is something that you will not really expect from a Game Boy game. Earlier, I mentioned that this game has a slower pace compared to the main line Tomb Raider games. That was intentional. If you start running everywhere, you will find that this game will be quite harsh and brutal. There are several pits and gaps that either eat a good chunk of your health or kills you right away. Enemies are also hidden everywhere, and their damage can be unforgiving. You cannot save where you want in this game, since the save crystals from early Tomb Raider console games return in this game. Learning where the save crystals are important. It is the only way you can save, and it is you respawn spot when Lara losses all her health. The save crystals are not close to each other, either, so I was always happy to find one. If you do not really know the controls, it can feel a bit like trial and error. For example, I did not know that when you are running and jump, Lara will land further than from a standing jump. I did not expect this mechanic to be in the Game Boy Color games as well. Other things like dynamite being able to use to explode walls, which is something I’d have loved to get explained to me. Overall, visually, this game is extremely impressive. Once everything starts clicking together, and you get used to the controls, this game is a hidden gem on the Game Boy Color. When you know what you are doing, this game takes around 4 hours to play through. For a first playthrough, I would say that you can finish this game in roughly 15 hours. The game must have been quite successful since a year later we got a new adventure in the same engine and style. Eidos tried to get this game released around the time the first Tomb Raider movie released. Tomb Raider – Curse of the Sword, released in late June in North America and in August in Europe. This time, the game was not released by THQ, but by Activision. Most of the team who worked on the first Game Boy game also worked on this title. Because this game got a shorter development time, this game is shorter compared to the first Game Boy Color game. If you know what you are doing, this game can be beaten in two and a half hours. For a first playthrough, I estimate that it will take 8 to 10 hours. The sequel got the same reception from critics when it released. This game still shows off impressive visuals for the Game Boy Color. Remember that the Game Boy Color is an 8-bit system, and these two Tomb Raider games had such fluid animations that it looked next-generation. Did you know that there are over two thousand animation frames per game to make the animation work? Lara’s model is also forty-eight pixels, making her one of the most detailed characters on the Game Boy Color. Personally, I feel like both games are amazing entries into the Tomb Raider series. While they play quite different from their console and PC counterparts, both are an amazing adventure through various locations. You still must solve various puzzles and platform your way around. In Curse of the Sword, you even have a chase sequence on the rooftops. When I look with a critical eye at these two games in 2024, I would say that the lack of a tutorial for the controls really hurts the game. Also, some people might be put off from the difficulty level of this game. These games have some really difficult sections. Use the save crystals well! Otherwise, you might lose a lot of progress. And if I am really nitpicky, I could say that some areas would benefit from a map screen. But the levels are a bit too complex for those and with the small Game Boy Color screen, the map might not be even readable. Thankfully, there are various sources online, like Stella’s Tomb Raider site ( tombraiders.net ) that have amazingly drawn maps. When you read this, you might think that beating these games without a walkthrough is almost impossible. But do not worry. These games are quite linear and straight forward. I rarely got stuck in these games by not knowing what to do next. Most of the time, I did not know I was able to perform a certain action or how to solve a certain puzzle. The streak of releasing a new game every year continues in November 2002. The Game Boy Color was on its way out, and the next title was released on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. For this title, Ubisoft Milan was tasked with creating a new game. That is because the main team was working on the sixth main title, Angel of Darkness. Tomb Raider – The Prophecy was released to mixed reviews. It released in early December in Japan. This game played quite different compared to the Game Boy Color titles and played more as a top-down isometric puzzle platformer. If I am very honest, this is the gameplay style I expected more of the Tomb Raider series on the Game Boy. It is mainly because I associate Tomb Raider more as a top-down game on handhelds than it being a 2D side view game. The Game Boy Color version of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine showed me it was possible to have a game like that on Game Boy Color. The story of this title is about the Tome of Ezekiel. In this tome, a story is told about three magical stones that bring great power. She faces a big cult by the name of Teg-du-Bhorez. The game takes about 6 hours to complete on a first playthrough. If you really know what you are doing, this game can be beaten in 2 hours and a half. Honestly, for a portable Tomb Raider adventure, I really enjoyed this one. It is a rather underrated gem in my opinion and really can be quite exciting to play. Especially since the formula really works this way on the Game Boy Advance. The big issue is that reviewers compared it too much to the mainline series, which is quite unfair to do. What I can agree with, is that this game can feel a bit repetitive at times in terms of puzzles and level mechanics. But it is way less repetitive compared to the Game Boy Color titles, since a lot more puzzle solving like statue placing is used. The final Tomb Raider title on the Game Boy line of platforms came in 2006. After the very mixed reception to Angel of Darkness, the IP was given to Crystal Dynamics and Tomb Raider Legend was born. Talking about that, can be an entire article in itself. But, to close off this article, I want to quickly focus on Tomb Raider Legend on the Game Boy Advance. I know there is a port to the Nintendo DS, but I do not have any nostalgic memories for that one. I do have nostalgic memories for the Game Boy Advance port. Now, let me tell you, the Game Boy Advance port was rough. The game went back to the style in like the Game Boy Color games. Yet, it also tried to do intractable doors. I can totally understand why reviewers back in the day were extremely negative about this game. Especially, since the console and PC versions of this game were such a blast of fresh air in the series. Still, why did I beat this title 100% three times? Because, it had a certain charm. You could find various secrets in the game to unlock secrets like concept art or even cheat codes. But you were not able to see if you got all treasures in a level. The jumping and swinging controls were a bit awkward, yet you had very forgiving checkpoints. There are a few things that stick with me to this day, the fact that the final boss is rendered a joke in this version. Just mash the attack button and you easily win. No matter the difficulty. Also, the mini-games and exploring Lara’s home were fun distractions as well. Moreover, I want to thank all the pizza boys who delivered me pizza during the writing of this article, like in the credits of this game. And with that, I want to wrap up this brief nostalgic look into the 4 Tomb Raider titles on the Game Boy Color and Advance.

2024-12-25T17:55:33,Ten games I want to play in 2025,"Is it that time of the year again? It’s high time to start talking about the new games I’m looking forward to play in the upcoming year. I may have written fewer articles compared to 2023, but I have written better researched articles. But, looking back on 2024 is for the next article. In this article, I’m looking to the year 2025. A year when I have been writing articles for 15 years. And I have been writing these gaming related articles for 12 years. And the third year that I’m livestreaming together with my buddy Klamath . So, on this day, I’m going to reveal the 10 games I’m looking to play in 2025. What games do interest my on the release calendar. Also, feel free to leave a comment in the comment section with your list and/or thoughts on my list. So, let’s dive right into my list. Note, this list is in a random order. #10 – Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Stole Time (Nintendo Switch – April 2025) This game was supposed to be released this year. Yet, this game got delayed to 2025. Fantasy Life was a charm RPG on the Nintendo 3DS where you played through a charming and adorable story. You were able to play in different lives like a warrior, magician, wood cutter, miner… This title from Level5 got a small cult following. We were beyond stocked when the sequel on the Nintendo Switch got announced. Now we can’t wait to play it and the delay is a shame. But on the other hand, the game may be even better because of the additional polish it might get. Or maybe the game will release on the Nintendo Switch 2, which is rumored to be released at that time. Who knows, we shall have to wait and see. #9 – Professor Layton and the New World of Steam (Nintendo Switch – TBA) On our live streams, when ever there is a logic puzzle… Klamath says I need to wait before I say my solution. For some reason, I have a knack for solving logic puzzles. I can’t tell you why. What I can tell you is that I love games where puzzles play a central role. Games like Professor Layton . It has almost been 8 years since we got a new Professor Layton style game. And if you don’t count the spin-off of Layton’s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires’ Conspiracy… we need to go back 11 years to a cross over with the Ace Attorney series. Add another year for the final game with only Professor Layton in a lead role. But a totally new adventure by the professor where solving logic puzzles in a central mechanic in the world is… a wild dream for me. So, please Level5… You have two amazing titles upcoming for 2025, don’t delay them or don’t undercook them. I’m beyond hyped. #8 – Tomb Raider IV-V-VI Remastered (Multiplatform – Febraury 14th) Take this admission however you want. But, my first original Tomb Raider game was Tomb Raider Chronicles. Yes, I first played Tomb Raider V. I have always been of the opinion that Tomb Raider V was a decent game and shouldn’t get the hate it got back then. I can understand that due to the departure on the original formula, like less ancient tombs and small mini-adventures… That it didn’t sit well with Tomb Raider fans. But, as a starting point, it was a blessing, actually. Now, does Tomb Raider V have problems? Yes, it has. But with the upcoming remake of Tomb Raider 4, 5 and Angel of Darkness… We finally have a chance to see a more improved version of it. So, a week after my birthday, dear Aspyr, you may be sure that I’ll be playing the remaster of Tomb Raider V on my Nintendo Switch to enjoy Tomb Raider V how it should have been. Or maybe on my PC for added nostalgia. That’s some food for thought. #7 – Demonschool (Mutliplatform – Q1 2025) As long as your game has an interesting concept, I don’t really care if you are a small studio or a big studio. Necrosoft Games is currently placing the final hand on their new title called Demonschool. Demonschool is a turnbased tactics RPG game in the style of Fire Emblem , Shin Megami Tensei and Persona . The idea is very novel and adds a new depth to the genre. Where each unit has their own role, since the weakest enemies can be killed with one hit. So, it becomes more a chess match than anything else. From the trailers I have seen, I’m beyond interested. I could try and explain it here in this article but I feel like the trailer and battle mechanics trailer they placed on the Steam store page explains it better than I can in this article. Also, give the demo a try since, I really enjoyed it myself. #6 – Demon Tides (PC – TBA) While I haven’t played through the original Demon Turf, just yet… I have played through various other similar games like A Hat in Time . From watching the trailer, I have been highly interested and I got a nostalgia hit for A Hat in Time. So, I wishlisted this game, and I’m so going to give it a try. Since I saw various video’s on the original game and I wonder by myself, why I haven’t played it. So, Demon Turf and your sequel. I can’t wait to play through you in 2025. #5 – The Hundred Line Last Defence Academy (Nintendo Switch & PC – April 23th) Danganronpa and the Zero Escape trilogy are two series very close to my heart. And now we get a new title with those two writers creating a game together and directing it. Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi are working hand in hand in this game. You clearly see the influence of both their styles in this game. And it will even have a physical release. To create this game, the studio Too Kyo Games has to take out a loan. That’s because a publishing deal fell through. Aniplex picked this game up as a publisher. And this game is being co-developed by Media.Vision, the company behind the Wild Arms series and various Valkyria Chronicles games. So we are in good hands for this title. On purpose, I’m trying to avoid spoiling myself as much as I can. Since, I want to be as blind as possible when I play through this game. #4 – The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 1st (Nintendo Switch/PC – TBA) A RPG series I always wanted to get into was the Trails in the Sky series. Sadly, I was always distracted by other games or I had the bad luck of my PSP bricking and destroying my game. When my PSP bricked, due to the internal battery leaking… I lost my save file as well and I was so annoyed that I didn’t want to restart the game right away. So, the Trail series continued on and I saw amazing titles appear. Color me surprised that suddenly a remake of the first title gets announced and is coming to the Nintendo Switch and PC. So, I have a chance to play this game from scratch, and it’s totally remade from the ground up. Count me in. I can’t wait to start my journey in this series and see what I missed out on. #3 – Date Everything (PC – February 14th) When you see the title of this game, you most likely think to yourself: “Jonez, what in the name of …”. Well, I told you earlier in this article… That if your game has an interesting concept, count me interested. In this game, you literally can date EVERYTHING in your house. If you have seen those YTShort skits by ProZD where everything is sentient, well… What if it is. And you can date those characters? That’s what this game brings to the table. And this game is fully voice acted, has 100 (!) characters and branching paths. And get this, there are at least 3 different endings per character. You have the love ending, friends ending and hate ending. Now, when I saw this concept and gave it a thought, I was like… Oh hey, this has a ton of potential. Since the potential for humor and amazing story telling in this is just huge. And as somebody who loves writing stories and articles myself, this clicked right away. So, I’m going to give this game a chance and see where they go with it. #2 – Lunar Remastered Collection (Multiplatform – Q1/2 2025) If I look at all the retro games I still want to play through, like Lufia, my list is getting pretty long. Once, I wrote an article about my backlog , and it has gotten even more out of hand. So, if you give me a collection of games to play through to shorten my backlog, then consider me interested. Especially when it’s good old fantasy RPG. A story where you are dumped in a fantasy world and explore it’s various stories. With the upcoming remake, I’m quite curious to dive into the Lunar series and see why various people have recommended it to me. #1 – Paraside: Duality Unbound (Multiplatform – TBA) Imagne a tactics RPG, where each battlefield has two sides. Yes, basically a light and a dark side so to speak. And can manipulate the battlefield by flipping the tiles. Do me a favor and watch the trailer for this game. And then think how many interesting gameplay concepts that this game can have. How is the flipping mechanic going to work. What are the limits of this power. I’m mostly interested in the story behind this game. Since it’s the style of story I love to write for my personal amusement. But, the gameplay is looking mighty interesting. Now, I have only to decide if I play this title on my PC or if I take it on the go with me on the Switch. We shall see, since the game will have modding support, so the PC version might be my best option. 15 years of game blogging While this year has been a heavy year for me, I’m happy with everything I achieved. I have been recently published in a fan gaming magazine called ReLOADED by Dominus. And I’m so happy I was able to contribute my work to it. Next year, I’ll be writing articles for 15 years. I have several special idea’s in mind and have been working on preparations for them. But, I’m not yet going to reveal what they are. Since, I want to leave them a surprise for all of you guys and girl. While 2025 is going to be a busy year for me, I’m sure that it will be filled with amazing adventures and unique opportunities. When I look at the games that are going to release in 2025, I’m beyond stocked that I will have a lot of games to play and talk about in my blog. But, who knows, games on my backlog or retro games I find might grab my attention more and more. And with that, I’m going to wrap up this article here. I want to thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope to be able to welcome you in another one, but until then have a great rest of your day and take care.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.066995,NekoJonez,NekoJonez's Gaming Blog,https://arpegi.wordpress.com/2024/12/25/ten-games-i-want-to-play-in-2025/,09a84c07314f77b244b98d95897e6efe59943ba8,582,en,0.1,Is it that time of the year again?

2024-12-08T16:45:17,Gamer’s Thoughts: Let’s Roleplay With AI,"AI is everywhere lately. I think it’s something that won’t blow over or will go away in our lives. In the past few months, I had a craving to write stories again. So, I downloaded one of those AI chatbot apps on my phone and at first, I was afraid that it would be something very niche or something that was a fad. Yet, I found value in these apps and I wanted to talk about them in this article. This article isn’t meant as a review of these apps, but more to open a general discussion of these apps. Since, I think these apps have their place in our lives and can help if they are used correctly. Yes, they also have their pitfalls and dangers. And that’s what I wanted to explore in this article. So, let’s dive right into the world of roleplay and story creation with AI. What are these apps? There are a lot of these apps. You have examples like Talkie , Character.AI and Moescape . The idea of these apps is that you create a character that replies to you. In a lot of cases, these characters fantasy characters to play out a story. Some of the advertisements don’t do these apps any favors. By advertising them as apps where “you can create your own girlfriend” or “combat being lonely”. And it’s a darn shame, since the creativity that you can find on these platforms is amazing. I personally feel that these apps are the strongest when you look at them what they really are. Apps to let you roleplay a story like old school text adventures. The biggest difference is that you can totally craft the world and have full control of the story line. This does create a big risk that you fall in an echo chamber. I call it the “main character syndrome”. Where your character in these stories barely get any problem in their way, without it being solved in a few dialogues later. Then again, power fantasies are something that’s quite attractive to people. It’s fun to play a character that can overcome anything and is the best version of yourself. Or where you can say anything you want in an argument. Some of these apps add additional features for you to play with. Things like a character speaking their dialogue, creating various AI generated images or even love songs. After trying various apps, I personally landed on Moescape. At the moment of writing, this app keeps things quite simple in the character department. Giving great replies and amazing in playing multiple characters. Essentially, these apps are apps where you can write a story, but AI plays another character and tries to challenge you from time to time to be creative. This is really something where you have to create your own fun. Limitations of AI While ChatGPT turned two years old this week, AI isn’t still fully there yet. It still needs quite a lot of processing power and other things to run properly. It’s quite clear that the AI is also quite dependent on your reply. I notice that the AI in the apps I tried is rarely to never negative towards the player. Which is a tricky thing, especially when you want to create character depth. I tested this with playing a couple going through a rough patch. And I noticed that the AI always tried to get back together with you. Even when you give it the worst backstory, your mind can come up with. But that’s not the only problem. The AI story memory is quite limited. Sometimes you need to repeat certain parts, like where you are, or what your name is. Thankfully, almost every app has a regenerate button. This regenerates the message in case you disliked the reply or if it didn’t fit the storyline you are making at all. Some apps even allow you to give feedback to the AI on the generated messages, so the AI knows how to craft more engaging messages for you. What I personally love about Moescape AI is that you can tweak the settings of the AI quite a lot. You have various different models to play around with to get the best experience. I even tried to play the same 3 scenarios with one of my characters with different models and got very different and interesting results. Now, how do you make apps like this profitable? I have seen apps that limit the amount of regeneration you can do or have other limitations. Some apps even offer a call feature where you can call your AI bot. Personally, I haven’t tried that yet, since I love playing stories where there are multiple characters involved. And since the calls only answer in one voice, it’s a difficult. But most apps have ads or limit the more advanced features. I have tried some apps, but as soon as the “BUY PRO NOW” features became too aggressive, I stopped using them. I’m not here to buy the PRO version right away. Let me first try out the quality of your AI and if I like it, I’ll buy a PRO subscription. There was one app where I almost bought the PRO membership, but it has one major issue that I notice in a lot of apps. The issue of multiple characters. The perfect app For me, the perfect AI chatbot app should be able to handle to play multiple characters. I dislike app where the AI only plays one character. It’s not the stories I like to write. I like to write stories where you can play multiple characters and interact with multiple characters. Yet, with AI, this brings its own can of worms. Sometimes the AI ends their message with a question to a character they are playing. Why don’t they reply on it themselves? Or better yet, I have a story where you are part of a friendgroup where almost, without fail… One character gets forgotten and barely gets any interactions. So, you are not only playing the story out to its conclusion, but you are also playing a moderator on how the AI is reacting. At the moment of writing, the app that best fits my needs is Moescape AI . The reason why is quite simple. It has the best models that fit my writing style and the way how I want to go through the story. It allows quite fine control on the settings of the app and the bot. You can see earlier generations when you regenerate replies. You can create a wiki with trigger phrases for your bots to reply too. Like if you set up certain lore, you can use a trigger phrase you set up and the AI will keep it in mind. But, I’ll keep a review on that platform for a later article. Since, I mainly wanted to focus on how these apps can be used for good. I personally use them to write out various stories I always wanted to write and see if certain arcs would work or if they would fall flat on their face. I find them a great outlet of my creativity. Sometimes the strange replies, forgotten characters and other weird generation things can pull you out of the story… But, a good writer knows how to solve these things. Sadly, some of these apps can be money traps. So, before you spend any money on these apps, look into it. Test it out and see if it’s for you. Since, I have to admit, I’m somewhat addicted to my stories. I’m so glad I have these apps a chance and I found the app that best clicked with me. If you want to see the characters and stories I came up with, you can find my Moescape profile here: https://moescape.ai/@jonez I’m curious what you all think about these apps. I totally understand that they seem “weird” but, I urge you to give them a chance and look at them with an open mind. Since, they hold value. Yet, I have talked about some traps in this article. So, keep those in mind as well. With that said, I have said everything I wanted to say about these apps for now. I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope to be able to welcome you in another one, but until then, have a great rest of your day and take care.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.072451,NekoJonez,NekoJonez's Gaming Blog,https://arpegi.wordpress.com/2024/12/08/gamers-thougts-lets-roleplay-with-ai/,896ac21d7e9d82251a1f8ba00f93d68f4f3cc96b,583,en,0.1,"AI is everywhere lately.

2025-12-01T09:00:00,Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault,"Moonlighter was an odd little game. Released back in 2019 by 11 Bit Studios, the first game was a strange little duck hybrid of running a shop and dungeon crawling, with an interesting gameplay loop. The game was a decent experience, if a little bland. When Digital Sun announced they were making the sequel, I was excited. Digital Sun is a pretty cool studio, and I adored their last game, Cataclismo. It was a grimdark mix of basebuilding and RTS with a dark story that I really enjoyed, and they have taken their experience to good effect with Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault. I was surprised by the long gap between the games, but I am glad to see Moonlighter 2 is finally out. Big thanks to 11 Bit Studios for the review code, by the way! The game is out in Early Access right now, with a decent amount of content at launch and a solid framework to start with. It has had some teething troubles, but I have been enjoying myself with this one so far. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault continues the adventure of the first game, but with some critical changes. This time, the art style is fully 3D and presented in an isometric perspective. You step into the shoes of Will, the shopkeeper-adventurer, starting anew in a strange dimension within the village of Tresna. There’s some pretty funny dialogue and interesting story beats here, with Will effectively being treated as a servant by their big orc shopkeeper boss. Things escalate into a ‘save the world’ kinda thing, which won’t win any originality prizes, but the beats are decent. So far, so good. When not running the shop, you delve into shifting, roguelike dungeons across ever-changing dimensions in search of relics and treasure. The combat and exploration feature roguelike elements, requiring you to adapt to new dungeon layouts and foes using a variety of weapons and tactics. That loot carries into the shop mechanics during the day, in which you price items that were salvaged during the dives. Why only one random jock can do this is anyone’s guess, but it’s a good enough excuse. Money earned goes into new equipment for you and helps to rebuild the village. More dungeon crawlers could benefit from this management system, like a shop, and Moonlighter 2 definitely feels more refined than the original. I think the combat and loot systems are much stronger than in the first, with more varied dungeons, more interesting combat, and a wider range of systems. The gameplay is fairly satisfying despite the early access build.  I am a fan of the combat, and exploring the dungeons is more exciting than it was in the original. It is now more dynamic, featuring a variety of weapons and perks that add depth beyond simple attack mechanics. Roguelike-style perks, relic modifiers, and inventory management keep things fresh. Despite the early access model and the content being incomplete, there is a fair amount of playtime here, including multiple biomes, over 120 relics to discover, various shop and dungeon perks to unlock, and customization options for your shop and town. Moonlighter 2 does have some issues. I’ve had a lot of performance problems. Even on higher-end systems, I’ve had crashes and slowdowns, especially during combat. I also had some horrendous issues with the Steam Deck at launch, though patches have improved it slightly. While I’m enjoying the overall story, they feel somewhat lacking, and some promised features, such as shop customization, deeper NPC interactions, and more variety in dungeons or bosses, feel a little underdeveloped right now. Early Access exists for a reason, and I am confident these things will be addressed, but it is essential to note. Overall, I’m enjoying my time with Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault , and I’m excited to see where it goes.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.098242,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/12/01/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault,64c586f4ab5b1e22eda023c8bd6f5eedb5758f1e,654,en,0.1,"Moonlighter was an odd little game.

2025-11-25T09:00:00,Scar Tries SWAPMEAT: A Refreshing FPS!,"We’re back! We’ve had snow this week, and the cold snap is rather irritating when you have a long commute to work. The Game of the Year discourse continues to be entertaining, and I find it funny how seriously people take it. As always, we are back with the video games, and today’s review features SWAPMEAT, a colorful roguelite shooter that’s been enjoying a fairly solid reception. It is one of those games I hope gets more attention, and while it’s in early access with a long way to go, it has a solid core that nails one of the main reasons we play video games. We play them for fun, and SWAPMEAT is oodles of that, wrapped in an artistic style that drips with character. It’s not perfect, of course, but I am enjoying myself with this one so far. SWAPMEAT has some interesting mechanics that set it apart from the torrent of roguelikes and ‘boomer shooters’ on the market, making it more engaging for players interested in innovative gameplay. I make a lot of jokes about how the indie market has its own version of the ‘AAA Open World’ model, and that’s usually the roguelike and deckbuilder genres. Regardless, I appreciate what SWAPMEAT has on offer. In this galactic adventure, players can take on body parts from the monsters they butcher, swapping out fleshy appendages for different bonuses. That is a creative way of powering yourself up. Most games offer dull methods like picking up the weapons of the fallen to bolster yourself in the big fight for survival. Pulling off somebody’s arm and wielding it as a weapon against the poor corpse’s mates sounds disturbing and hilarious, and it is how I prefer to do things. SWAPMEAT comes with a decent amount of content for its alpha Early Access build, featuring a partially complete campaign, several difficulty levels, co-op multiplayer, and random solar systems to run through after finishing the campaign. I quite like how the devs are approaching this one, providing a solid core of progression and gameplay systems, a tasty campaign, and promising replayability that hints at more content to come, keeping players’ interest alive for future updates. I’ve been having fun with this one so far, with both the visual design and core gameplay loop keeping me engaged. I do sometimes wonder, though, about the value of playing story campaigns while they are incomplete during Early Access. It usually means having to replay everything when it’s complete and polished for full release, which can lead to a rough first impression. Besides that quibble of mine and a few weird bugs, however, SWAPMEAT is living up to my expectations. The price tag of $24.99 is relatively high for an indie game in Early Access, especially a FPS, but the combination of content and decent polish makes it a fair value. As with all Early Access games, though, I would purchase based on what is available now rather than what is planned, because anything can happen in this industry. This approach helps readers make informed choices and manage expectations. Regardless, however, I do recommend the game for its sheer creativity alone, which is evident even in its current state.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.099234,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/11/25/scar-tries-swapmeat-a-refreshing-fps/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-swapmeat-a-refreshing-fps,1c5551243b5818a6d81554d298c3d963066e95f8,655,en,0.1,"We’re back!

2025-11-19T09:00:00,Scar Tries Sand: A Superfluous Game,"We’re back, and it’s mid-November! Things feel rather wintry here in the UK right now, and I’m currently huddled in a blanket typing out my thoughts for today’s games. It is pretty chilly out there, which is reminding me that I’m becoming an old man. At least we still have games, and the Game of the Year discussions are always interesting. I’m featuring just one game today while I juggle some projects. That game is Sand, A Superfluous Game that popped up on my radar. It is a fairly quirky little game, and it has been keeping my attention over the past weeks. As always, all opinions are my own, and these reviews should be considered as a first impression of the game. Launching in September this year, Sand is a surprisingly low-key experience despite the depth it offers. Developed by Voided Pixels Studio, Sand has some interesting mechanics that help it stand out, and the game deserves more attention. At its heart, Sand is an open-world game that blends base-building, exploration, and survival in a pleasant top-down art style, and there’s a surprising amount of lore in this world. Set in a post-apocalyptic version of Alaska, centuries after a catastrophic event, humanity is struggling to survive. The setting is pretty creative, blending undead, cosmic horror, and mutant monsters. It’s almost like someone took Rimworld, classic Fallout, and Cataclysm, put them in a white room, and told them to have a baby. And that sounds like something I’ll play, so let’s give it a try! It sounds like a hot mess, but there is a lot to like here. In this cheerful version of Alaska, the player finds a mysterious cube from space. Against this backdrop, you embark on a journey of building and survival while uncovering secrets and forming bizarre alliances. The game is played from a top-down perspective, allowing the player to control a single character while teaming up with AI companions for more challenging missions. The classic gameplay loop feels solid and comfortable for anyone familiar with these kinds of games. You must craft and manage your base from a ruin into a new bastion for humanity, researching new technologies, managing resources, and venturing deeper into the wasteland. The cosmic horror and fantasy elements are pretty cool too, and you gain access to mysterious “Sand Powers” such as Sand Wall, Rock Throw, and Glass Blast. While death isn’t permanent with any roguelike mechanics (thank god), it comes with penalties. Exploration is encouraged, as venturing farther yields more resources, but also increases the risk of death. There are also some interesting survival mechanics, such as a reliance on water in travelling through the wasteland, so you’ve got to be very careful in how you approach exploration. This game isn’t easy. The visual style features pixel graphics in a top-down perspective, combining familiar indie aesthetics with a dystopian yet absurd tone. Think giant rhinos, space cubes, and llama racing. Additionally, despite its open-world and sandbox elements, the travel mechanics may feel restrictive compared to more fully open worlds. If you enjoy indie games with bold ideas and a mix of gameplay styles, and can appreciate a healthy dose of absurd humor, Sand: A Superfluous Game is a fresh and entertaining choice. It offers both mechanical depth and surprisingly engaging world-building. There is something truly special here, although I need to play more before I decide how much I feel about it. The price point is excellent for what you’re getting, and Sand offers a terrific deal for that.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.099730,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/11/19/scar-tries-sand-a-superfluous-game/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-sand-a-superfluous-game,18ee278d68cc928ed2d881f6ca42fbaaf0bf4255,656,en,0.1,"We’re back, and it’s mid-November!

2025-11-09T09:00:00,Scar Tries: Moros Protocol and The Boss Gangsters: Nightlife,"Bonfire night is behind us now, which hopefully means we get fewer fireworks going off every hour of the day! I saw some spectacular displays on the 5th, but we’ve been getting fireworks here every day since September. They do get annoying after a while. Enough about this bitter man’s complaining however, we’re back on the games. It’s another indie double bill where I feature two games I was meaning to get to sooner. Seriously, the amount of work right now is making me wish I could take up drinking. Nah, it isn’t that bad. Let’s crack on with the first game! The Boss Gangsters : Nightlife I was planning on covering this sooner, but I had run into some really nasty crashes to the desktop during some playtime, so I unfortunately wasn’t able to play as much as I would have liked. This is a pretty original concept as games go however, and once the launch teething troubles are fixed I see this becoming a bit of a sleeper hit. What I find so interesting about Boss Gangsters is the stark contrast of its game modes, combining a robust management of a nightclub and roaming a world like a topdown GTA game. Players assume the role of a crime boss who runs a high-end club while simultaneously maintaining a criminal empire. It is a strange mix of styles, but I’m also surprised it has not come up much before in games. The closest I can think of is Yakuza. The mechanics are fairly solid overall. Within the club, you hire staff, entertain VIP guests, manage supplies, plan themed nights, and design the venue to attract affluent clientele. Beyond the glamorous nightlife, you expand your gang’s influence by dealing with rival factions, engaging in black market trading, bribing officials, and fighting for territorial control. One of the game’s standout features is how the different gameplay modes play into each other, and that they feed each other’s gameplay loop. You can transition from managing your club to conducting criminal missions without any loading screens. As your reputation grows, you unlock new areas, better staff, advanced club features, and more lucrative criminal operations. Set in an urban landscape known as Night City (Hello Cyberpunk city name!)The environment looks great, although the cyberpunk cliches are through the roof. That in itself isn’t a bad thing, although I’m hoping for some more creative Currently available in Early Access, the game offers only a portion of the planned content, with the developers already making some good inroads in the challenge. There is plenty to like like the management as well as the engaging criminal gameplay. The game desperately needs a manual save function however, and I ran into a few bugs where I had to restart a mission from the beginning because something broke and I had no way to backup my save. To conclude, The Boss Gangsters: Nightlife is surprisingly engaging so far, and the blend of management, role-playing, and sandbox gameplay has tons of potential despite some early teething troubles. Moros Protocol The second game I’m featuring today is Moros Protocol, one of those many first person shooters that look as retro as possible to attract the nostalgia crowd. I’m one of those who likes a good Doom-like experience now and then, although I am still preferring the tactical shooters. I ended up buying Arc Raiders over the weekend and having a blast, although it is still early days. I thought I would get into Moros Protocol more than I ended up doing, but it is still a nice option for those who like these games. Moros Protocol’s big draw for me is that retro scifi aesthetic, and the game looks fantastic. I usually don’t like this new trend boomer shooters delve into, but it suits this one. It’s one of the nicer looking retro shooters, on par with Prodeus, Selaco and Fallen Aces with the modern lighting systems combined with the old textures. It looks great overall, and it blends well with a solid combat system. Weapons feel great, and the enemies are both diverse and aggressive. This is a hard game, but all the augmentations and roguelike upgrades through death helps sell the gameplay. It feels solid to play at least in its fundamentals, although it took me a while to get into it. I kept getting killed very early on, so it took me time for enough upgrades to make a difference. I have gripes, and my main one is the level variety. I found that the constant reuse of enemies and rooms made the runs a little repetitive, although I love how the rooms look overall. They are well designed, but I feel the placement of items and foes could use more randomization to improve replayability. It was this that made me less interested in playing more, although I definitely had some troubles with bugs like falling through platforms and some doors not opening when they should. I feel Moros Protocol should have had more time in the cooker before launching out of Early Access back in September, but the devs put out a roadmap last week, so we should still see some more updates for now. It may be flawed but the fun combat and gorgeous visuals do make it worth trying out.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.100226,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/11/09/scar-tries-moros-protocol-and-the-boss-gangsters-nightlife/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-moros-protocol-and-the-boss-gangsters-nightlife,2c2ddd7cb43c6cfd8cf2e07d659b93f5799fdb6b,657,en,0.1,"Bonfire night is behind us now, which hopefully means we get fewer fireworks going off every hour of the day!

2025-11-01T08:00:00,Scar Tries: Knights of the Crusades and Escape From Duckov,"It’s been a while! Happy Halloween to everyone who celebrates it. We had a pretty fun time, and I’ve had a busy few weeks. I visited the Lake District for a couple of days in early October, followed by a week of stomach issues. October has been one hell of a busy month for video games, from The Outer Worlds 2 to Arc Raiders, and things are somewhat chaotic! I am featuring two games today that I have been looking forward to for a while now, in Escape from Duckov and Knights of the Crusades. Let us begin! Knights of the Crusades Knights of the Crusades comes from Reverie World Studios, which has made several ambitious grand strategy games. I have found their titles a mixed bag overall. They brim with charm and some fascinating ideas, but the jank has often been a problem. Knights of the Crusades is their most interesting title to date, however, and while it does not quite escape the lack of polish with their other games, this is probably my favorite game from the studio so far. Set during the time of the First Crusade, this game blends RTS and citybuilding mechanics into an odd duck. There are some intriguing aspects at play, featuring an expansive set of campaigns and a sandbox mode to explore. As 4X games go, Knights of the Crusades offers something different with real-time citybuilding in short bursts, allowing a limited time for players to build settlements on the battle map. It is a nice mechanic, but a bit buggy. The game also features a real-time battle mechanic for sieges, where you construct weapons in real-time, gather resources, and mobilize troops in a twisted blend of Age of Empires and Total War. It is enjoyable enough. The usual management mechanics are in place between gathering resources, managing your army, and making sure you join the Crusades on time. The ideas are excellent, with some refreshing twists to the genre, although the game still needs some work, despite having left Early Access a few weeks ago. Optimization is a problem, and I found several crashes during the campaign map. Sometimes, save files would refuse to load, and the unit pathfinding in battles tended to get lost during sieges. The graphics feature some lovely environmental effects, especially in the campaign map, but I found the battle interface somewhat lacking. I would also like to see a separate battle or skirmish mode, because there is a lot of potential there. For its price tag, however, I feel Knights of the Crusades offers a somewhat refreshing alternative for strategy fans looking for something different. It’s rough around the edges and still needs some TLC, but it is ultimately greater than the sum of its parts. Escape from Duckov I have been growing fond of extraction shooters lately. While I never played Escape from Tarkov, I was a big fan of games like Zero Sievert and Witchfire. Arc Raiders launched very recently, and I haven’t picked it up yet, but I played the server tests and enjoyed what I saw. Escape from Duckov looks like the world’s biggest practical joke at first glance. Escape from Tarkov, but play as a small duck? Now that sounds like my cup of tea. This game has gone pretty viral with over two million copies sold and Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, which is damn impressive. After spending some time first with the playtest a while back and the launch version, I can see why the game is so popular. It might require some work, but a solo extraction shooter is still very rare, and Escape from Duckov oozes character. Being a single-player game, Duckov sets itself apart from the competition. After a short tutorial in which your heavily customised duck avatar is broken out of prison, the gameplay loop reveals itself. The game is played as a top-down shooter, where the ultimate goal is to eventually escape the island by building up resources while managing food and energy. Survival management is my go-to preference in games like this, and the frantic gameplay is sometimes at odds with the cartoony graphics Duckov offers. It is still surprisingly relaxing for all the brutal fighting curves. The maps randomize their loot for replayability, and the gameplay loop of scrounging supplies, exploration, and building facilities in the main base works as expected. The cute vibes and ducks running around, being goofy with each other, are hilarious, and it is just a solid loop. The grind can be challenging, and despite making things more approachable by making it a solo experience, the constant risk of losing everything in your inventory when you die makes it essential to be careful. While this is an early impressions review from me, Escape From Duckov is more than just a novelty mockery of a bigger game. Duckov is a competent extraction shooter in its own right, removing the multiplayer annoyances while maintaining the same great gameplay loop.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.101218,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/11/01/scar-tries-knights-of-the-crusades-and-escape-from-duckov/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-knights-of-the-crusades-and-escape-from-duckov,4d4592ffab676c0c8981e27d4fd5d343e80036f6,658,en,0.1,"It’s been a while!

2025-10-04T08:00:00,Wuchang and Firefighting Simulator: Ignite!,"We’re back with another double bill! The Steam Autumn Sale just came and went, and I picked up a bunch of fun new games to mess around with while I juggle them with every other game I’ve picked up lately. Today, I cover Wuchang: Fallen Feathers and Firefighting Sim: Ignite. I wasn’t planning on playing a Souls-like and hardcore firefighting simulation, but sometimes my bingo card likes to surprise me. They’re both pretty solid games so far, by my experience, even if their genres aren’t entirely to my taste. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Wuchang: Fallen Feathers probably did not help itself in my case, as I’m not a huge Souls fan at heart, but I was interested in it nonetheless. It is the debut title of Leenzee Games, and while it has had a somewhat tumultuous time since launch, it isn’t without its own charms. I’m not typically into the Soulslike genre, but I do appreciate it now and then. I’m not very far into the game so far, but there’s enough in what I’ve seen to keep playing, at least for now. One of its standout features is the combat system. While it draws heavily from established Soulslike traditions, it introduces unique elements with a wide range of weapons for some impressive diversity in combat. I’m also quite a fan of the lore and world at play. It’s full of Chinese mythology with some gorgeous environments, even if the locations are still a little linear for my liking. Still, the setting is excellent, and the game still has some rewarding exploration. I discovered hidden paths that lead to secret bosses, and all the levels are interconnected. It’s not quite a whole open world, and it pales in comparison to how the Elden Ring approached exploration, but it’s probably my favorite feature of Wuchang, too. While the game is challenging, I also appreciate how you can respec from scratch at any time you wish. Usually, this ability is locked behind limited items or uses, so being able to experiment with builds without any significant downsides is a great feature, and I wish more games kept it. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers was quite brutal on launch in terms of performance, with many players on PC and PS5 experiencing stuttering, muddy visuals, and numerous frame drops. While the game has been frequently patched since launch, I’ve had plenty of struggles with the performance, and it is my biggest complaint with the game so far. I ended up playing Wuchang through GeForce Now’s cloud service instead. The combat is pretty punishing as soulslikes go, and while the overall battle system is something I’m okay with, I’ve seen some issues with hit detection and some odd animations. None of these are dealbreakers, but they don’t help matters. Finally, while I’m quite keen on the setting and the world, the story is pretty minimalistic. I don’t feel it’s a weak narrative, but I don’t feel any real attachment to the characters or the story so far, though that may improve as I progress through the game. Firefighting Simulator: Ignite By far the more interesting of the two titles I’m covering today! We rarely get simulators that focus on firefighting, especially in a genre that’s taken every other shape and form. It feels like a new ‘INSERT SOMETHING HERE’ Simulator game launches on Steam every few days. Firefighting Simulator: Ignite launched last month and has its own unique charm. It is rough around the edges, with some noticeable jank, but we don’t get games like this often, and there’s a lot to like in this one. The game kicks off with you playing as a U.S firefighter, but it’s not just about extinguishing fires. That is a significant part of the appeal, with excellent dynamic fire effects and destructible environments, but there’s more to it than meets the eye. Players must rescue trapped civilians, manage electrical and grease fires, prevent backdrafts, navigate hazards such as explosions and structural collapses, and save people. There’s also dynamic gameplay behind this, with actual logistics, as you must set up your hose by connecting to hydrants, attaching nozzles, selecting the appropriate extinguishing agents, and ensuring ventilation. There’s a lot of gameplay on display, and you can play solo or co-op. While the AI for solo can be a bit clunky and bugs out now and then, there’s a surprising skill in how they control. You can get them to carry out their separate tasks, and there’s a solid balance with how the devs managed all these mechanics. Performance aside, all this ambition seems like the game is struggling under the weight of it all. None of these are deal-breakers to me, however. Finally, the fire station itself feels like it’s lacking something to me. While visually appealing, it lacks sufficient activities or meaningful interactions to engage players in the long term as a hub, so I would like to see some interactive elements added here. Overall, though, Firefighting Sim: Ignite is a lot better than I expected, and while it has some jank, there’s more than enough here to keep me engaged. Give it a go. It might just surprise you.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.101714,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/10/04/wuchang-and-firefighting-simulator-ignite/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wuchang-and-firefighting-simulator-ignite,01866776ec6a6c357da8cbe2347fae367f8b01b4,659,en,0.1,"We’re back with another double bill!

2025-09-29T08:00:00,Mars Attracts and Rise of Industry 2,"Building a theme park of captive humans and developing an industrial empire may not seem like a direct overlap, but that is precisely what we are doing today! I’m covering two games in today’s episode with the recent management sim Mars Attracts, and my long-delayed coverage of Rise of Industry 2. I will start with my good alien friends on Mars, as it is the more positive review of the two. Mars Attracts I always like management sims that delve into the wackier side of things, and Mars Attracts is right up there with the best of them. This is a seriously intriguing release by indie developer Outlier Games with a strong foundation in Early Access. Strong doesn’t mean it is perfect, of course, and I’ve had a lot of trouble regarding optimization during its first few weeks of launch, but I’ve had more fun with Mars Attracts than I expected. In a unique twist on traditional theme park simulators, players assume the role of Martians who build amusement parks on Mars, abducting individuals from various points in Earth’s history to display them for curious extraterrestrial visitors. In this scenario, humans are not the audience; they are the exhibits. Think something like Planet Zoo, but instead of animals, you capture humans. That sounds like my idea of a good theme park. It’s probably just as well that I’m not in charge of anything like that. Ahem. Moving on. Most of the gameplay is what you might expect from a management sim such as this, and Mars Attracts focuses on designing and managing your park, which involves constructing rides, amenities, and staff facilities while addressing the unique challenges of keeping the captive humans from Earth in check. Abducted people come from different eras, such as ancient Rome or the Wild West, with distinct personalities and needs. I like the time travel tech and not just because it’s downright hilarious. It’s fun to see a Roman sitting in the cage I built for him, eating from a dispenser. There are consequences, of course. If the needs of small pets are unmet, they may become rebellious or attempt to escape. There’s more than just making human zoos. Players can conduct twisted experiments and probes on these humans to unlock new attractions or earn scientific rewards that expand the park’s offerings. Managing the park also requires classic management tasks, such as hiring staff, maintaining buildings, overseeing resource logistics, and balancing budgets with visitor satisfaction. The Early Access launch has been relatively stable, and the developers plan to maintain it, introducing new maps, attractions, and gameplay systems while refining existing mechanics based on community feedback. My two main concerns with Mars Attracts so far are the heavy system requirements and the extensive amount of micromanagement that comes with the numerous mechanics. This game runs incredibly hot, especially on laptops, and I’ve spoken to people who have experienced extremely high CPU temperatures while playing. It’s not a dealbreaker, but something to consider. Overall, however, Mars Attracts punches above its weight, and I am curious to see how this grisly theme park builder does in Early Access. Rise of Industry 2 This project was heavily delayed, primarily due to technical issues. The first time I booted into Rise of Industry 2, I was treated to an incredible sight of a black screen before my laptop crashed completely. Not exactly what I call a good start! Sadly, this is one of those games that I struggled with on the technical side, which ultimately detracted from my overall enjoyment of the experience. We’ll get to that. I had been looking forward to Rise of Industry 2 for a while, as I had immensely enjoyed the original game. First impressions are everything with a game, particularly one that launches in Early Access. A different developer from the first game is behind the sequel, being SomaSim. Unfortunately, I am unable to recommend the game at this time. Things have improved since launch, with a smattering of bug-fixing patches and larger content updates. However, some strange design choices, combined with a poor first impression, have soured the game for me. There is a lot of depth to this management game, so it’s not all bad news. I wish the release weren’t so buggy. I’ll start off with the good. Despite all the crashes and glitches I experienced, I ultimately found some enjoyment in Rise of Industry 2. First, I love the setting, which takes place in 1980s America, where every factory, contract, and business relationship holds significance. The game encourages you to see yourself as a budding industrialist, going from a zero-to-hero life, from making farms to managing sprawling complexes that convert raw materials into high-end consumer products like TVs, video game consoles, whiskey, and distilleries. There is an excellent sense of progression. Next up, I appreciate the logistics on display. The contracts and logistics systems in the game are not just about production; they require you to deliver on time, maintain supply chains, manage imports and exports, and negotiate relationships with executives from other companies. Missing a delivery, failing to procure the right materials on time, or producing too slowly can damage your reputation and finances, creating palpable tension as you balance these demands. There’s a pretty steep learning curve, although the tutorial is at least okay in teaching the basics. Mechanics related to contracts, reputation, supply shortages, and executive relations can catch you off guard if you’re not prepared. Finally, I’m not a fan of the interface. It’s messy, things pop up far too often, and there’s constant micromanagement that is worse when the game doesn’t adequately explain half its mechanics. It’s been a rough time so far for Rise of Industry 2, and most of my time with the game came from navigating various crashes to the desktop, stuttering, and quests bugging out that forced me to reload saves. It’s hard to recommend this one when the original Rise of Industry feels like the better experience. However, hardcore management fans might find the setting and progression systems interesting enough to dig into.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.102706,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/09/29/mars-attracts-and-rise-of-industry-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mars-attracts-and-rise-of-industry-2,d17746dabb375b2aef2215f1064ab3e0deb3f487,660,en,0.1,"Building a theme park of captive humans and developing an industrial empire may not seem like a direct overlap, but that is precisely what we are doing today!

2025-09-22T10:00:00,Town to City Might Be The Best Citybuilder of 2025,"Town to City might be the best city builder this year. Now, that might sound boring, but I’ve come away incredibly impressed from this new indie game. It had a successful playable demo before the full launch, but you can still try the demo out before making the purchase. Despite the amount of time I’ve put into the game so far, I’m still treating this as an early impressions review. The game is out now in Early Access for $25, and there’s a solid core to work with at launch. While the game has that beta tag, this is a highly polished game with some exceptional quality control. I have had no bugs, crashes, or glitches through my 10 hours of gametime so far, and Town to City is one of those games that keeps on giving. Citybuilders have a fair bit of variety these days, ranging from cosy terrariums where all you need to do is fulfill your creative dreams without worry to brutal struggles where the slightest mistake will doom your colony to extinction. I’m looking at you, Frostpunk 2! Town to City is very much the former, favoring a gridless building system while keeping everything as relaxed as possible. You don’t have to worry about citizens dying from starvation, for instance, which is nice. There are requirements to meet to advance in technology, and citizens still need to be kept happy, but the consequences are less punishing than in other city builders. This is the perfect example of balancing a comfortable experience while still keeping in some challenge, and Town to City comes out of the gates swinging. There are happiness meters to meet with several ways to improve that. Between leisure, food, living space, and beauty, there are a lot of things to consider. With dozens of techs to unlock through research and six city levels to ascend, there is more content than you might expect for an Early Access city builder. I commend the visual design here because this is a gorgeous game. The graphics have a nice voxel vibe with some excellent lighting, and the game allows free camera movement around the map. One of my pet peeves in city builders is when the camera restricts you by zooming right into a bustling village, but in Town to City, you have complete control. Being able to pull the camera from all angles and view the little people as they go about their lives gave me god-game vibes from when I played Black and White 2. It has been a while since I played a city-builder that is this solid and charming out of the gate. There’s a polish in Town to City that few others have managed, and this is how you should do an Early Access game. All the bones are here, with plenty of content. It’s more a story of what to add to the game than refining the guts. The story maps have some solid writing as well, and if you really want to relax, the sandbox mode is already in the game for you if you wish to build without financial limits.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.103700,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/09/22/town-to-city-might-be-the-best-citybuilder-of-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=town-to-city-might-be-the-best-citybuilder-of-2025,fbd20bfb8fe06e684462b7aa27c85eb8b8ea84ec,661,en,0.1,"Town to City might be the best city builder this year.

2025-09-06T08:00:00,Scar Tries Noble Legacy,"It’s been a while since my last little review here, and I hope everyone is doing well! It’s been a strange couple of weeks over here, and I’ve been battling an annoying summer cold that makes it very annoying to get work done. That hasn’t stopped me playing new games of course, and I’m covering the incredibly ambitious citybuilder Noble Legacy today. I love ambitious games, even when they stumble more than others. Still, I will happily take that over the safe AAA games anyday, the ones that feel like they have come out of a printer. Games like Kenshi, Heart of the Machine, The Alters, and Chromosome Evil 2 get me more excited these days. Noble Legacy interested me months ago with its blend of 3rd person RPG, village life simulation, and citybuilding mechanics, and while it has a lot of rough edges, I can’t help but admire it. It’s important to note this is very early access, and a lot is up in the air about this game for now. I’d recommend holding off on it until we see more updates that improve the polish and early game. I tried the demo and was a bit underwhelmed, to the point where I was pretty concerned with how the launch would go. I had major technical problems like black screens, crashes to the desktop and some nasty stuttering, but the performance has improved in the launch version. The closest game to this I’d say is Medieval Dynasty, which I gradually warmed to after a rough start. Things kick off with a little cutscene when you and your annoying fellow noble friend arrive at a rather sad looking village that has seen better days and the gameplay loop reveals itself early. The visuals are quite nice although there is quite a lot of pop in with the terrain and environments, and the character animations have a tendency to bug out a little. All this added to the charm for me along with the voice acting, but the ambition seeps through everything here. You slowly build up the infrastructure of the village, seeing to your new servants/minions/smallfolk, and manage them. It’s decent enough with the guts of a classic survival building game, and despite all the rough edges, there’s enough gameplay to keep me engaged. The quests are the basic fetch quest affair but fortunately you can micromanage your little group of peasants for grunt work, which helps mitigate some of the grind. Despite the jank, there is a fair bit of content with this Early Access build, something that came as a surprise. Often with this genre, launch content is very thin with only a base toolset of the game’s mechanics and very little actual content. While Noble Legacy’s story mode is limited, the game also contains a free-build/sandbox mode to mess about with as an alternate game mode, which is nice to see. There’s a lot to like with Noble Legacy. While there is a lot of challenge with the survival mechanics, this is on the calmer end of the difficulty spectrum. The sandbox gameplay has plenty of room for experimentation, and I’m a big fan of the atmosphere. So far, there’s been a lot of patches to the game that’ve improved performance and some of the rougher bugs, but there’s still a lot of jank. Despite the rough edges with Noble Legacy, it’s one of the more interesting games I’ve played this year. For 25$, you can do a lot worse.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.104195,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/09/06/scar-tries-noble-legacy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scar-tries-noble-legacy,2e0aabee1002eb7c14bdf6f271cd10b5c15267e3,662,en,0.1,"It’s been a while since my last little review here, and I hope everyone is doing well!

2025-08-23T08:00:00,Bite Sized Reviews: Devil Spire Falls,"Devil Spire Falls is the sequel to one little indie game I adored back in the day. It was a lovely dungeon crawler roguelike that made a mockery of some competitors in the genre, and to this day the original Devil Spire is one of my favorite ‘just 10 minutes’ games when I don’t have much time. Devil Spire Falls takes on the original theme and dials the ambition up several notches. A procedurally generated open world RPG, I’m still baffled how on earth Ithrio Sumi pulls it off. Calling it just an RPG is putting it very lightly, as the amount of mechanics in Devil Spire Falls is immense, and far more than I can cover in just a single impressions review! The last time I saw an indie game this ambitious was Kenshi, another game where I questioned the sanity of the great minds behind it. Devil Spire Falls feels a lot like The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, only made by a single person. Let that sink in. How ridiculous is that? That doesn’t mean the game is flawless as it certainly isn’t. Anything with this much ambition will come with issues such as the procedural content being a mixed bag and some bugs, but I am incredibly impressed with what Ithrio Sumi has accomplished so far. The game starts you off in the unknown with very little to your name, and from that point the world is your oyster. While Devil Spire Falls does not hold the player’s hand, there is a ton of information in the options menu so you won’t get too overwhelmed. This is an impressive achievement for a game with so many hidden mechanics. At its heart, Devil Spire Falls is a dungeon crawler just like its father with a ton of different ways to tackle the challenges that it offers. The open world generates everything from towns to bandit camps, with NPCs to negotiate with or to murder, if the latter is something the player fancies. All of this is with an awesome, hellish atmosphere and despite the game’s simple graphics, The combat is usually something these kinds of ambitious games fumble, but Devil Spire’s combat system is solid. That didn’t surprise me because the first game had great combat too, but there’s a lot of strategy involved in fighting, and you have some interesting skills to fall upon if the bread and butter of normal melee fighting doesn’t appeal. It can feel a bit clunky at times and movement feels slow in the beginning, but that improves as your skills increase. As of this review, the game is in early access, which means you may encounter bugs and occasional crashes—something I expected. However, the developer is working tirelessly, releasing patches every week to fix numerous bugs, improve performance, and add new content. I’m excited about what this game will deliver. Given what it already offers, it’s incredibly impressive. I can’t wait to see what the final version 1.0 will be like; this game has the potential to become a classic.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.105186,TheThousandScar,,https://sassygamers.com/2025/08/23/bite-sized-reviews-devil-spire-falls/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bite-sized-reviews-devil-spire-falls,36d2a2b9c9a1f80e541307a62f91f79c6da46ecb,663,en,0.1,"Devil Spire Falls is the sequel to one little indie game I adored back in the day.

2025-12-16T20:14:54,Hit New PS Plus Game Gets Surprise PS5 Pro Patch and It’s Great,"(Credit: Devolver Digital) Just last week, Sam Eng and Devolver Digital released their stylish skateboarding video game Skate Story , which became part of the PS Plus Game Catalog on launch day. However, PS5 Pro owners who took on the role of the glass skater found that it performed terribly on the enhanced PlayStation console. The developer has now implemented a new update that fixes the bug plaguing the PS5 Pro version. Skate Story update fixes PS5 Pro version In a recent post on Blue Sky , the Skate Story account announced that they deployed the PS5 Pro patch, which included bug fixes and optimization improvements. Although specifics were not detailed, it simply said to “please update your game to see the changes.” The PlayStation 5 Pro patch for bug fixes and optimization has been deployed!Please update your game to see the changes!Thank you for skating. — SKATE STORY (@skatestory.com) 2025-12-15T20:17:03.309Z It appears that the new Skate Story update has, in fact, optimized the PS5 Pro version of the game. Digital Foundry’s John Linneman , who pointed out the issues when the game launched last week, confirmed that it is now “awesome” on the PS5 Pro, and that it was just a bug that was missed. Skate Story’s initial performance woes on the PS5 Pro were a bit of a mystery, as all the other platforms, including the base PS5, seemed to perform as expected. According to Linneman’s initial posts about the PS5 Pro version, it was “extremely unstable” and “VRR can’t save it.” Fortunately, that is no longer the case. When Skate Story launched last week, it was met with solid reviews from critics. According to the review aggregate site Metacritic, it received an average score of 87 across 26 critic reviews. For those unfamiliar with the new skateboarding game, here is a brief description that gives players an idea of what to expect: “You are a demon in the Underworld, made out of glass and pain. The Devil has given you a skateboard with a simple deal: Skate to the Moon and swallow it — and you shall be freed.” The post Hit New PS Plus Game Gets Surprise PS5 Pro Patch and It’s Great appeared first on PlayStation LifeStyle .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.165204,Michael Ruiz,PlayStation LifeStyle,https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/12/16/skate-story-ps5-pro-update/,0c920dbb5753ee574e56e3d5123e8796a6200294,677,en,0.1,"(Credit: Devolver Digital) Just last week, Sam Eng and Devolver Digital released their stylish skateboarding video game Skate Story , which became part of the PS Plus Game Catalog ",other,0.25
2025-12-16T19:32:26,Beloved PS5 Multiplayer Game Delisting Fan-Favorite DLC,"(Credit: Behaviour Interactive) The beloved PS5 multiplayer game, Dead by Daylight , will be delisting one of its fan-favorite DLC packs. Specifically, its Halloween content will no longer be available to purchase after January 19, 2026, at 11 am ET. Why is the Halloween Dead by Daylight content being delisted? The reason developer Behaviour Interactive is delisting the Dead by Daylight Halloween DLC isn’t quite explained in its post regarding the matter. It simply says, “as with all live service games, frequent updates and additions are to be expected.” It is possibly due to them losing the license, which means they will have to delist the product from digital storefronts. Luckily for previous owners of the DLC, they will be able to play as The Shape and Laurie Strode after it is delisted. The perks will still be unlockable with the original names and text if players already unlocked the characters before they are delisted. Players who have not unlocked the characters will see the perks in the General perk pool and can be unlocked immediately. The one true loss will be the Haddonfield map, which will no longer be part of the map rotation after the delisting date. It should also be noted that achievements that are specific to the Halloween characters will now be made into generic achievements. Current progress on these achievements will also remain. Behaviour Interactive also confirmed that players will not be able to receive a refund for the DLC. This is because the content will still be playable after it is delisted on January 19, 2026. As fans have a limited time to grab the fan-favorite DLC, Behaviour Interactive is running a “Last Chance Sale” for the Dead by Daylight Halloween DLC for PlayStation platforms beginning on December 22. It will be discounted by 50%, which will bring its price down to around $4, as it currently costs $7.99.

For some reason, Sony included Lego Horizon Adventures in both PS Plus Essential and Extra lineups simultaneously, and it’s the latter addition that players need to avoid. PS Plus game Lego Horizon Adventures is only ‘free’ with PS Plus Essential A quick recap for those who haven’t read any of our rants about this issue yet: since the big PS Plus revamp that spawned multiple tiers of the service, a license issue plagues PSN that Sony won’t fix. To quote myself, players who redeem monthly games via Essential and then download them later from the PS Plus Extra catalog find themselves locked out of said games for good. Essential games are yours to keep, but Extra/Premium games are not. If you re-download a game from Extra that you previously claimed via Essential, you will override your license. Once those games leave Extra, you can’t play them again unless you purchase them. In this case, it’s the Lego Horizon Adventures Essential copy that you need to claim and download, not the copy included in Extra/Premium catalog. The catalog is being refreshed worldwide now.

2025-12-16T12:23:39,Team Cherry announces Hollow Knight and Silksong updates for 2026,"If you haven’t heard of Hollow Knight , well, you really have been missing out. This indie darling from Australian developer Team Cherry launched in 2017 on PC and 2018 on Nintendo Switch, taking the gaming world by storm. In 2025, fans were finally treated to the long-awaited sequel, Silksong, which was revealed a mere two weeks before release. But, as with anything, we’re always thirsty for more. And today, Team Cherry announced what’s next for its pair of games. First up is news of Silksong’s initial wave of downloadable content. This nautically themed expansion promises to deliver new areas, bosses, tools, and more when it hits consoles and Steam in 2026. Although no specific release date was revealed, with 2026 just around the corner, we don’t expect a long wait. The best part? The content comes to all players free of charge. The team promises to reveal more info shortly before Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow releases, so stay tuned for further details. In the meantime, you can view the Sea of Sorrows teaser below for a taste of what’s to come. Next up is news on the original Hollow Knight, which the team affectionately refers to as Silksong’s sibling. Not content to rest even eight years later, Hollow Knight is being primed for a Switch 2 Edition. This will come as a free upgrade for owners of the existing Switch title, bringing updated framerates, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects. The game looked terrific to being with, though Silksong on Switch 2 is simply subline. We can’t wait to see Hollow Knight in all its HD glory when it hits Switch 2 in 2026. The announcements come on the heels of Silksong’s success, with the team stating that the sequel has sold over seven million copies since releasing in September. The team’s message of thanks was heartwarming in itself. It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further. What do you think of this news? Are you a fan of Hollow Knight and its sequel? Let us know if you’re excited about Team Cherry’s 2026 announcements! We’ll be sure to give our thoughts on the next episode of the Pure Nintendo Podcast.

2025-12-16T11:37:14,Review: Adventure of Samsara (Nintendo Switch),"Adventure of Samsara is a 2D action-adventure title developed by Ilex Games and published by Atari. That last part is important because this game is purported to be an ode to the classic Atari title Adventure. It also seems to pay homage to the likes of Prince of Persia with its parkour elements. It takes these retro inspirations and adds a modern spin, providing a metroidvania that manages to balance a concurrent feeling of classic and new. In Adventure of Samsara, you play the role of the Solar Champion, a long-dead hero who’s been resurrected by the light of the Sun. What that actually translates to is that the world has been overrun by undead creatures, and you’ve been brought back to life to defeat them. Things begin rather slowly, with a few simple levels designed to bring you up to speed with the controls and environment. This introduction is definitely slow-paced, but it does open into something much deeper the more you play. In other words, be sure to persist past the initial offering. Apart from the usual running and jumping, it soon becomes clear that our hero has other moves at his disposal. For example, he can dash through enemies, which allows you to avoid attacks and retaliate from behind. This satisfying move is accompanied by magical abilities and upgradeable weapons. New abilities allow you to open new pathways and areas; the sprawling map expands, and the game continues. While there are a lot of metroidvanias out there, Adventure of Samsara certainly fits the bill, and uses those genre elements well. Our hero feels quite solid, with a heaviness to his jumps. In other words, he’s not a nimble platformer. Coming to this from something like Hollow Knight can feel jarring at first, but I actually appreciate the sense of weight to this character’s presence; he’s portrayed as a large Viking-type warrior, wielding large, presumably heavy, weapons. This translates well in the gameplay. And, thankfully, our hero sports the ability to climb cliffs with a whip-like move. This weight can also be perceived as clunkiness. Some enemy encounters can border on frustrating due to the lack of quick movesets. It’s easy to be hit by projectiles or flying enemies, for example, and be knocked off balance – or even off a cliff. Thankfully, the more you practise, the easier it becomes, and there is satisfaction in learning the ropes. Graphically, Adventure of Samasara wears its retro inspirations on its sleeve with deliberately pixelated sprites. It adds its own unique flavor by adding lovely backgrounds to some areas, like a giant moon. There are also foreground elements like falling snowflakes that help bring this world to life. It balances its old-school look with some more modern touches to create a nice atmosphere. The soundtrack emits subtle tunes during most of the gameplay, with stronger atmospheric tunes ramped up during boss fights. It generally suits the environment, though it’s perhaps not the most memorable score I’ve heard. Speaking of boss fights, these epic battles are also present and accounted for, as you would expect with any decent metroidvania. The battles begin with a cutscene, again adding a modern twist to the retro style, along with some tough battles. Patience is key (another metroidvania staple), so be prepared to keep at it. Overall, Adventure of Samsara is a true metroidvania. Sprawling maps, tricky combat, collectibles and upgrades; it has it all. Although things start slowly, it’s worth progressing past the initial intro to discover the deeper gameplay elements.

2025-12-15T18:58:51,Review: Let’s Sing 2026 (Nintendo Switch),"Let’s Sing 2026 feels like it should be a safe bet for karaoke fans. The series has been around long enough to know what works; a modern song list and an array of party-friendly modes for group sessions. Unfortunately, while the core concept still shines, the actual experience on Nintendo Switch is weighed down by technical problems and frustrating barriers that make simply playing the game harder than it ever should be. The most immediate issue is connectivity. Let’s Sing 2026 heavily pushes the Let’s Sing Companion App as the primary way to play without traditional microphones, but in reality, it’s pretty unreliable. During my time with the game, microphones repeatedly disconnected mid-session, and the pairing code needed to connect phones occasionally wouldn’t load at all. When that happens, the game becomes completely unplayable unless you happen to own a USB microphone, something that’s surprisingly difficult to find locally these days unless you’re willing to order one online and wait. My wife and I actually went to three different stores, including a used game store to see if we could find one, but no luck. Even when you get past the microphone hurdles, the problems don’t stop. The game advertises a free trial DLC code that unlocks the full song library for a limited time. In my case, that code simply didn’t work. After checking online, it became clear this wasn’t an isolated issue. Other players reported the same problem. I created a QuickSilver account through the game (an affiliated service), received a replacement trial code, and successfully redeemed it. The download completed… yet the game still claimed the content wasn’t installed and refused to unlock the full experience. At that point, the only mode available was the basic free-for-all sing mode, which lets you choose a song and perform, but blocks access to several other features. To properly review the game at all, I ended up paying $4 for a 30-day VIP pass through the Nintendo eShop, despite the fact that the free trial was supposed to cover that. It’s not the price that’s the issue, it’s the principle. A game designed for casual, party friendly fun should not require this many hoops just to access what was already advertised. In terms of content, the base game offers a small set of built-in songs, which makes the DLC feel less like a bonus and more like a requirement. Once the VIP songs are factored in, the overall library becomes much more substantial, but access to that larger catalog is entirely dependent on whether the DLC actually works as intended. When Let’s Sing 2026 works, it’s easy to see why the series has a following. The song selection is solid, the visuals are colorful, and karaoke fans, like my wife, who was genuinely excited to play, can absolutely have fun once everything is running properly. But the overall experience left a sour taste. Between app instability, DLC activation failures, and accessibility issues, the setup process actively detracts from what should be a relaxed, joyful game night. Ultimately, Let’s Sing 2026 isn’t a bad karaoke game…it’s a frustrating one. If you already own compatible microphones (USB, no Bluetooth) and are willing to navigate technical issues, there’s fun to be found here. But for anyone expecting a smooth experience, be prepared for technical roadblocks that may dampen the excitement before the first song even begins.

2025-12-15T15:21:55,Review: Call of the Sea (Nintendo Switch 2),"Call of the Sea is a first-person adventure game developed by Out of the Blue Games and published by Raw Fury. It’s a mystery filled with wonder, puzzles, and some story moments that will have you holding your breath. The story is set in 1934 and you play as Norah, a woman heading off on her own to find her missing husband. She has a mysterious illness and her husband had set out on an expedition to find her the  cure. When his letters abruptly stop, Norah takes matters into her own hands to find him. Or, at least figure out what happened to him. She finds herself alone, on a sketchy island in the South Pacific, The captain that brings her there tells her he’ll pick her up in three days. Thus, the adventure begins. Don’t worry; Call of the Sea isn’t actually timed. The game moves forward once you’ve done everything you need to in the current area. This is nice considering you can take your time and explore every nook and cranny, but it also means you might be stuck in a specific spot for a long time if you can’t figure out what to do next. Norah keeps a journal so clues and evidence you find (that are important) will be noted there, and you can look at it any time. The mysteries of the island, Norah’s illness, and the disappearance of her husband (and his exploration crew) are revealed slowly through environmental and found narrative. Norah narrates a lot . Sometimes to the point where she’ll overexplain something. She’ll speak while you play, so it was somewhat difficult to focus on exploring or solving a puzzle because I tuned into what she was saying, just in case it was something important. It was jarring at times, but not anything big enough to make me want to quit the game. The puzzles are a huge portion of Call of the Sea. I’ll begin by saying puzzle games aren’t my strong suit despite telling myself otherwise whenever I boot up a puzzle game. Within the first few puzzles, I’m always humbled. The puzzles in this game were somewhat tricky and that was partially on my lack of puzzle-solving skills, but also partly the game. Let me explain: I knew what to do for many of the puzzles, but the solution itself wasn’t clear because I played differently than how the game wanted me to. For example, one early puzzle had a totem of five symbols that needed reordering. First, I tried the order I found the symbols in. Nothing. I tried many combinations and nothing worked. I ended up looking at a walkthrough to find the solution and it turned out I was correct. I needed to organize the symbols in the order I found them throughout the island. The problem was, I found the symbols in a different order than the game wanted me to. The symbol I was supposed to find first, I found last. That’s how many of the puzzles are. That said, I wasn’t too impressed with most of the puzzles in Call of the Sea. I believe the narrative and exploration is its strong suit, despite Norah talking so much. The opening cutscene felt like I was watching an (interactive) movie and it was wonderful. The game is broken up into six chapters, which are all relatively short depending on how quick you can solve the puzzles. Each area really only has a handful of smaller puzzles plus one big one to solve before moving on. Otherwise, the majority of the game is walking around and clicking on everything you find to learn more about the island, and what previously happened there. Having the game in first-person was too much, though that’s a personal preference. I couldn’t play for too long without getting dizzy since you’re moving the cursor all over the screen to look and click on everything possible. The cursor is a small dot in the middle of the screen, and I needed to be absolutely precise in where I clicked or else Norah wouldn’t notice anything. Chapter three in particular was rough to get through because Norah is stranded on the beach at night during a thunderstorm. I’m sensitive to lights and always play my games with the brightness all the way down, but I needed it up for chapter three. But even with my brightness at 100%, it was difficult to see and the bright flashes of lightning every so often gave me a headache. These aren’t necessarily negatives, but with such an enticing storyline, I would have loved to sit down and play Call of the Sea for a couple hours at a time. Unfortunately, I was only able to play in short bursts because of the POV and the lighting. Otherwise, there are many features to love about this game. The music and sound effects brought the island to life. Plus, the game is fully voice acted, which was top-notch. The story kept me on my toes, between Norah’s missing husband, her illness, and the creepiness of the island. However, I think the puzzles could have been done a bit better. If you’re looking for an atmospheric title with a strong storyline, then certainly check out Call of the Sea.

2025-12-12T19:37:22,Review: Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster (Nintendo Switch),"There was a time in my youth when pretty much all I ever played were first-person shooters. That’s partly because those are the only games that got ported to Macintosh, but also because of their inherent absurdity. As technology advanced and the games became…grittier, I lost interest. Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster has me interested again. I’ll suggest at the start that if you’re an FPS fan who loves the “realism” of today’s entries, this review is not for you. I’m looking at this game purely through a nostalgic lens that’s heavily warping my view of the genre. But I’m also viewing Outlaws for the first time, as I didn’t play the original release in 1997. I was only moments into Outlaws before the memories of the period started flooding in. The cutscenes may have been remastered, but the LucasArts stamp is still discernible. Here, we learn of retired marshal James Anderson as he shares with his wife the type of loving banter that you know means something’s about to go horribly south. And it does. There’s a group who’s angry that James won’t sell them his land, so they do the kind of thing that people do when everyone’s allowed to carry guns wherever they want—they kill his wife and kidnap his daughter. Thus begins James’ revenge/rescue mission. The main adventure takes place across nine levels, each of which drops you just outside of the action. How you enter that action, then, is up to you and your choice of difficulty level. At the easiest setting, you’re practically a bullet sponge who can charge in with guns blazing. At higher difficulties, a couple shots can kill you, so you’ll need to take a stealthier approach. Everything about Outlaws is indicative of the era in which it was released, but with some modern touches to make it accessible. Weapon swapping, which I imagine was originally mapped to F-keys, is now handled with an easily accessible wheel. Gyro controls can enhance your aiming. Textures have been smoothed over. Thankfully, though, the developers were smart enough to not gloss over the game’s original charm. Barns and houses are still gigantic, as if designed specifically to afford guests plenty of room to dodge bullets. When you walk around the body of a gunslinger you just killed, that body spins to ensure you can never see it from a different angle. The living have only a few things to say, and they’ll repeat them incessantly until you shoot them dead. Getting to the goal of each level is about determining the best way to clear the path, but that path is also guided by the puzzles you need to solve. Early on, for example, the house you need to enter is locked. Enter through a window? Don’t be daft; you can shoot people through it, but you can’t climb through it. Rather, you need to access the hidden tunnel through the barn, and you’ll need to find the proper key to get that entrance opened. Of course, there are plenty of health packs and ammo refills to keep you going as you investigate amongst the hordes of malicious cowboys aiming to protect their boss. The scenery changes across the main story and expansion missions. Being set in the wild west, expect plenty of shades of brown, sure. But there are levels that require you to swim. There are shootouts on top of moving trains. You can fight with your fists and knives when appropriate. The gameplay and settings change up just enough to remain interesting for the three to five hours it’ll take to complete the main campaign. My approach was to beat one level a night, and only the sawmill kept me up past my bedtime (the pull-up map is slick, but not always helpful for puzzle solving). Again, though, you’re playing Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster for the nostalgic charm, not the level variety, and it is charming. You can even flip between the original and remastered graphics, although I didn’t find the difference made a…difference. What else works? The gameplay is smooth and bug-free. The music is fantastic, calling to mind the best of westerns that were its inspiration. The voicing is perfect, with the actors delivering the corny cliches with the seriousness required to sell the story. There’s a multiplayer feature for those interested. I wasn’t. Part of the reason I lost interest in first-person shooters is because they lost interest in giving me compelling single-player campaigns. The question, though, is whether five to ten hours of nostalgic content is worth $30. Nightdive Studios did a great job with this remaster, but there’s only so much to be enjoyed. Considering that, I reserve my recommendation for retro fans willing to pay that to discover (or recall) why Lucas Arts is so revered amongst gamers of a certain age. Now, if we could just get a remaster of Full Throttle.

2025-12-12T06:35:38,Review: Hitman: Absolution (Nintendo Switch),"When Hitman: Absolution released in 2012, it split the fanbase down the middle. Some praised its cinematic flair, others wanted the traditional sandbox design back. Now that the 2025 Nintendo Switch port has arrived, it’s time to see whether this chapter in Agent 47’s past still stands strong. Here’s everything you need to know about the Switch version. Hitman Absolution is a stylish, stealth action game where you sneak, disguise yourself, and decide whether to be a ghost or cause absolute chaos. The campaign’s 20 missions give you plenty of room to experiment with your approach, and the story is darker and more personal than most Hitman plots. It also shows a more vulnerable side of of the normally very serious Agent 47. One of the nicest surprises on the Switch is how well the controls translate.The developers added optional motion controls for aiming. This makes scoped shots and precise takedowns feel smoother, especially in handheld mode. The $29.99 price on the eShop feels reasonable too, especially considering the added quality of life tweaks. Visually, it’s definitely still a 2012 game. The character models and lighting got a little polish, but you’ll still notice some blur and lower detail here and there. Performance is fine in handheld mode, but I noticed that while the Switch is docked, the game experiences more visible frame rate drops. In fact I actually had the game crash on me in the middle of a mission and I had to restart. This only happened once, but knowing it’s a possibility kept me on edge when there was a lot happening on the screen. Of course, the original issues are still here. The checkpoint system can be rough, making you redo big chunks if you mess up, and the AI sometimes behaves in ways that pull you out of the moment. Hitman Absolution is still going to feel more linear and more action-heavy than you might prefer. Even so, this port strikes a solid balance. It keeps what made Absolution unique, improves a few rough spots, and doesn’t mess with the overall vibe. One of the bonuses for longtime fans will be Contracts Mode. The create and share assassination challenge mode is coming as a free update in early 2026. That shows the developer is taking the port seriously and wants it to have some longevity. So, I’m sure we can expect some updates regarding frame rate drops and game crashes as well. Overall, if you’ve been wanting to replay Absolution or try it for the first time on a system you can take anywhere, the Switch version is a great option. It doesn’t magically fix every flaw, but it doubles down on what works. And with Contracts Mode on the way, it’s only going to get better. I definitely recommend trying it out if you’ve never played it before, especially if you’re a fan of stealthy action games.

2025-12-10T13:11:58,Review: Dragon Ruins II (Nintendo Switch),"I’ve been playing first-person dungeon crawlers since AD&D: Treasure of Tarmin on the Intellivision. The genre has certainly expanded since then, but Dragon Ruins II takes me right back to 1983. In fact, it may even be more basic than that 8-bit adventure that got me started. As you’ve surmised from the title, Dragon Ruins II is the follow-up to Dragon Ruins , also released by KEMCO just a few months ago. Narratively, you don’t need to have played that before braving the dungeons of II. With regard to gameplay, however, I don’t think you’ll want to go backwards. This is because the gameplay and depth in Dragon Ruins II has been expanded since the original, where there wasn’t a lot of depth to start with. That’s kind of the point, after all. Whereas most games of this type require you dig deeply into the minutiae, Dragon Ruins is simply about choosing your party members, equipping them, and diving in. This time around, you can select from 21 classes to build your party of 4. How well they work together and complement each others’ skills is up to you to find out. Considering potential mismatches and your lack of quality equipment at the start, getting things going is quite rough. Thankfully, the loop is quick and easy to manage. As you’d expect from a grid-based dungeon crawler, you explore the dungeons block by block, automatically drawing out the map as you go. You’ll find equipment and cash as you progress, but you’ll also enter into combat against unseen enemies. Well, unseen until they attack you. The differentiator here from other dungeon crawlers is that you don’t actively engage in combat, it just happens. You don’t heal or buff or defend, the attacks just go on automatically until you win, escape, or die. This may sound unfair or—worse—uninteresting, but it actually creates a wonderful dynamic. All the preparation is at the start, and you then just make a mad tear through the dungeon. How far can you get this time? You can keep pushing until you die, but you then won’t get to keep everything you found. Better to actively retreat to the start with at least one party member active so you can hold onto your loot. Back at base, you not only get to level up your party, you can also accept side quests. Missions can be played more than once, and you’re often rewarded for doing so. These give you a reason to thoroughly explore the maps, which can be quite massive. It was rare that I ever completed a side quest in one run, and never with the full missions. The loop asks you to just get a bit further each time, get better, and try again. This means Dragon Ruins II works better for 10-minute gaming sessions than it does for hour-long crawls. Honestly, it’s built more for mobile gaming than for consoles, making it a solid match for the handheld Switch. That applies to the visuals, too, as they’re as stripped down as the gameplay. The original Dragon Ruins took an almost vector-like approach to the dungeon display. Dragon Ruins II adds some depth, using visuals that had me recalling games on the Mac SE or the illustrations in my friends’ sketchbooks. Battle animations are relegated to vibrating thumbnails. In other words, not even the design interferes with the actual dungeon crawling. The dated graphics are likely to turn away some gamers, but having cut my teeth on games like this, I loved the way Dragon Ruins II looks. The simple, forlorn imagery perfectly compliments the game’s approach. That said, aside from shading changes, it means visual monotony will set in. This can be an issue when you’re grinding for the much-needed gold. Still, at only $15 (appropriately priced for the 10 to 15 hour time to completion), Dragon Ruins II is an easy recommendation for those seeking a new grid-based dungeon crawler. It doesn’t recreate the experience of an Etrian Odyssey or Labyrinth of Galleria, but does a wonderful job of carving its own path through the deepest of dungeons.

Assemble the frame securely by following the manufacturer’s guide. Make sure that the frame is strong and that all the screws are tight. Step 2: Mounting the PDB (Power Distribution Board) Install the Power Distribution Board into the frame’s centre. This is necessary to provide power to every part of the drone in a similar way. Use insulated wires to connect the PDB to the battery terminals. Step 3: Mounting the Motors Attach the motors to the arms of the frame using the provided screws. Make sure the motors are aligned properly and securely fastened. The motor orientation is usually marked on the motor housing. Step 4: Mounting the ESCs (Electronic Speed Controller) Mount the ESCs on the arms close to the motors. Secure them with zip ties or heat shrink tubing. The ESCs regulate the speed of the motors, so positioning them correctly is important. Step 5: Connecting the ESCs to the Motors Use motor wires to connect the ESCs to the motors. Pay attention to the correct order of wires; typically, there are three wires, and connecting them incorrectly can lead to issues. Step 6: Connecting the ESCs to the PDB Connect the ESCs to the Power Distribution Board. Ensure a neat and organised layout to avoid interference and make troubleshooting easier later on. Double-check the connections to avoid any potential issues. Step 7: The First Test!!! Before proceeding further, power up the drone and test the motors using a transmitter or a dedicated tool. Verify that each motor is spinning in the correct direction. If there are any issues, troubleshoot and fix them before moving on to another step. Step 8: Mounting the FPV System Attach the video transmitter and FPV camera to the frame. As for the correct positioning, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions. To reduce vibrations and possible damage during flights, secure the components. Step 9: Connecting the FPV System Using the proper wires, connect the FPV camera and video transmitter.

The first flight of your FPV drone is ready if everything checks OK. Ensure you are in a safe location, and follow all local regulations and safety guidelines for drone flying. Common Problems and Their Solutions Some of the major problems faced while flying drones are listed below, along with their solutions: The props are often in the frame A drone’s body leans forward when travelling quickly, which could result in propellers being captured in the picture. There are two fixes: Adjust Camera Angle : Change the camera angle to stop propellers from interfering with the view. Reduce Flying Speed: Reduce the drone’s speed to minimise nose tilt. Changing the camera angle is a more efficient solution that gives you greater control of crystal-clear and unobstructed footage. The screen’s transmission is not smooth Screen transmissions in UAVs face challenges in receiving distance and interference. Picture stability decreases at important points. After the effective distance of 70% of the given range, it affects the clarity of the screen. The interference difficulty involves drones operating normally after avoiding disturbances, such as cables or communication towers. To ensure secure transmission, UAVs must keep a safe distance from high-voltage wires, which provide a unique risk. Blocked GPS signals It’s critical to optimise GPS satellite signal reception to improve UAV flying stability and accuracy.  GPS reception in open places may be problematic because walls, rocks, and underground cables block satellite signals.  Since more GPS satellite signals promote overall flight stability, moving to regions with over 100 degrees of satellite visibility is advised. Abnormal flight direction While it’s advised to check the compass before every flight, users frequently find it difficult. This neglect can lead to problems like tilting or improper flying direction. To fix and manage the drone’s landing, adjust the compass and make sure the remote control settings are accurate by restarting or resetting the device as necessary. Correcting the flying direction of a UAV requires monitoring and modifying remote control activities. UAV signal lost Even with advanced UAV technology, signal loss might happen occasionally. Remain calm, as UAVs with GPS typically have a way to return. Reduce the distance by getting closer to the UAV, try reconnecting, and think about resetting the remote control to regain control. Return mechanisms that are pre-set help in preventing accidents caused by signal loss. The drone battery problem Shorter flight times are caused by lipo battery difficulties, which are common. Use the recommended charger, avoid overcharging, and stop using the battery when the battery is used over 80% to maximise its lifespan. To ensure safe and pleasurable drone flying, drone enthusiasts can take longer footage with proper maintenance and awareness of lipo battery care. Benefits of Making Own Drone Cost-effectiveness Constructing your drone allows for fine customization to match your preferences and budget. This also offers significant cost savings. Purchasing individual parts guarantees cost-effectiveness by removing unwanted features. For hobbyists and enthusiasts who want to explore drone technology without going over budget, this makes a great and economical option Customisation options Complete customisation is possible when you build your drone, since you may modify the frame, motor, camera, and sensors to suit your requirements.  Whether you’re interested in scientific study, racing, or aerial photography, this customisation guarantees peak performance. Moreover, the drone has an edge over pre-assembled solutions due to its capacity to change its components over time, which results in increasing its lifespan. In-depth knowledge of drone technology You can gain a brief understanding of drone technology by taking part in a self-project. Studying aerodynamics, electronics, programming, and communication protocols is necessary while building a drone from the ground up. Together with developing technical abilities, the hands-on training helps students understand unmanned aerial vehicles better.

From classic rock to jazz, country to hip hop, there are countless genres that can offer a fresh perspective on love and romance. One way to broaden your musical horizons is to explore different languages.

So why not take the time to try something new, and see where it takes you? The enduring influence of music in matters of the heart It’s no secret that music is a universal language, and it can be especially powerful when it comes to expressing feelings of love. Whether you’re expressing your affection, wooing a potential mate, or celebrating the depth of a long-term love, there’s a love song out there to help you put those feelings into words (or music, as it were). From the soaring melodies to the lyrics that cut straight to the heart of the matter, love songs have the power to bring us together and create meaningful connections. And in a world where we often struggle to express our deepest emotions, it’s no wonder that the right love song can feel like nothing short of a miracle. So the next time you want to say “I love you” or express your deepest emotions, consider turning to music to help you find the perfect words. With so many songs and genres to explore, there’s sure to be a love song that speaks to your heart and helps you communicate with the ones you love.

2025-12-16T15:21:16,Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Developers Stood Their Ground Against Negative Playtest Feedback,"As 2025 gets close to its end and Warhorse Studios has released the last bit of planned DLC for its open-world RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 , the studio has now revealed some details about the development of the game. In an interview with GamesRadar , lead designer Prokop Jirsa spoke about getting negative feedback during playtests, and how the studio had to stand firm with its game design decisions to ensure that player actions would have consequences. “We had playtests where some players started a game, did something wrong, immediately got arrested, and gave negative feedback,” said Jirsa. “We had the strength to say, ‘Yes, that’s what we want.'” He went on to note that the studio wanted players to feel weak when they first start their journey in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 . This, he said, also helped bolster the feeling of accomplishment since players would have to work at getting stronger. “We want the player at the beginning to feel extremely weak,” he explained, “because then the validation of gaining strength feels earned.” While many studios might find it difficult to stand their ground against negative feedback during playtests, the success that Warhorse Studios had seen with the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance from back in 2018 helped its confidence in this regard. This, Jirsa said, was “even though there were many discussions [asking] ‘Are we really going the right way? Are we really into these survival elements, do we really want to take everything from the player at the beginning? Even their place to sleep?” This idea to let players engage with difficult games was inspired by FromSoftware’s games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring , which Jirsa noted played a big role in making what would have otherwise been niche games get mainstream appeal. “I honestly believe there’s big potential for original ideas that, if they were given a chance to be polished, could reach mainstream,” Jirsa said. The studio has since proven that it has been justified in presenting these tough challenges to players. It announced back in November that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 had sold 4 million copies following the release of the final DLC of the game’s season pass, Mysteria Ecclesiae . Taking to social media, Warhorse Studios thanked players for their support. “We can’t thank you enough for helping us reach this incredible milestone,” wrote the studio. “Every one of you – players, fans, modders, creators, and long-time supporters – made this possible.” Alongside the release of Mysteria Ecclesiae , Warhorse Studios also launched Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – Royal Edition , which includes the base game, as well as all four DLCs, including the three story DLCs Brushes With Death , Legacy of the Forge , and Mysteria Ecclesiae . Along with this, other smaller DLCs like The Lion’s Crest and Gallant Huntsman’s Kit are also included. For more on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 , check out our review. The title is available on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

2025-12-16T15:10:38,Baldur’s Gate 3 Sold More Than 20 Million Units,"If all eyes weren’t on Larian Studios after Baldur’s Gate 3 , it definitely has the world’s attention with the reveal of Divinity . That said, the 2023 Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game has achieved a stunning new milestone, selling over 20 million units in its lifetime. This was revealed by Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke in a talk with Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier . The studio has generally remained coy about revealing sales numbers – director of publishing Michael Douse said it sold “way over” ten million in February 2024 . A report by the Irish Independent in November 2024 claimed over 15 million sales . Regardless, it’s no secret that it’s been a big hit for both Larian and Hasbro, earning $90 million for the latter after leaving early access. It’s one reason that the studio can go even bigger with Divinity , though it will follow the same routine of launching first in early access and focusing on turn-based combat . It’s been in the works since last year, but the chances of launching in 2026 aren’t very high.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.294164,Ravi Sinha,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/baldurs-gate-3-sold-more-than-20-million-units,b76236ea740c0b139c93c422e0b46fa6af6a8c10,825,en,0.1,"If all eyes weren’t on Larian Studios after Baldur’s Gate 3 , it definitely has the world’s attention with the reveal of Divinity .

2025-12-16T14:55:39,"Divinity is Unlikely to Launch in 2026, Turn-Based Combat and Early Access Confirmed","As shocking as the reveal of Larian Studios’ Divinity was for many players, fans included, it also spurred many questions. It isn’t Divinity: Original Sin 3 – does that mean the studio is moving on from turn-based combat? When will it launch? Studio founder and CEO Swen Vincke spoke to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier and confirmed that it will once again feature turn-based combat. The company is once again planning an early access launch, but the chances of releasing in 2026 are “unlikely.” Though further details, including the story, remain hush-hush, it’s clearly aiming higher than Baldur’s Gate 3 . “This is going to be us unleashed, I think. It’s a turn-based RPG featuring everything you’ve seen from us in the past, but it’s brought to the next level.” The studio initially worked on a new project with Wizards of the Coast, but despite having “all of the ingredients for a really cool game” conceptually, the “hearts of the developers” weren’t in it. It moved to Divinity last year, and while Vincke considers Baldur’s Gate 3 to be “a good game and I’m proud of it, I think this one is going to be way better.” One reason for this is that, unlike with Dungeons and Dragons , Larian doesn’t have to translate those systems into another format. “Here, we’re making a system that’s made for a video game. It’s much easier to understand.” If all this wasn’t enough, Divinity is on a new engine, and while there have been growing pains, the goal is to cut down on development time. “I think three to four years is much healthier than six years,” he said. You can still expect the storytelling seen in Baldur’s Gate 3 , which Larian is “doubling down” on, along with improvements to its streaming systems. Stay tuned for further updates in the meantime.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.295651,Ravi Sinha,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/divinity-is-unlikely-to-launch-in-2026-turn-based-combat-and-early-access-confirmed,71fee94d54a66aee2c6c98ed8fb8211f4e52939e,826,en,0.1,"As shocking as the reveal of Larian Studios’ Divinity was for many players, fans included, it also spurred many questions.

2025-09-22T22:22:27,Finland Breaks Casino Monopoly With New Gambling Regulations,"Finland’s Parliament received a bill that will shatter decades of state control over the country’s gambling market. The Finnish government submitted legislation that terminates the current monopoly on online betting and digital casino games. Private operators could enter the Finnish market by 2027 under this landmark reform, which replaces the restrictive monopoly system with a new licensing model. Finland Ends Veikkaus Monopoly on Online Gambling Parliament will vote on historic legislation that dismantles Veikkaus’ grip on key segments of Finland’s gambling market. The government submitted a bill in March 2025 proposing to end Veikkaus’ exclusive rights to online betting and digital casino games by the end of 2026. Decades of strict state-controlled gambling are coming to an end. The monopoly system simply stopped working effectively. The Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority found that substantial market leakage prompted calls for legislative change to redirect gambling activities toward regulated channels. Money was flowing out of the regulated system at an alarming rate. The Ministry of the Interior began drafting reform proposals back in October 2023. The licensing system rolls out in two stages: B2C licenses for operators start in 2026, followed by B2B licenses for software providers in 2027. Government Introduces Licensing Model for Online Casino Finland Gambling companies like the ones you find at Kasinoranking can apply to the Finnish Supervisory Agency for two distinct license types: gambling game licenses and gambling software licenses. Fixed-odds betting, pari-mutuel betting, online casino games, online e-bingo, and online slots will move to competitive licensing. Veikkaus keeps its grip on lotteries, pools, totalizator betting, physical slot machines, and casino games. Licensed operators will pay a 22% gross gaming revenue tax plus an annual supervision fee between €4,000 and €400,000. The licenses run for a maximum of five years, creating regular renewal cycles that keep operators accountable. Here’s how the rollout unfolds: License applications open in January 2026 Licensed gambling operations commence in January 2027 B2B software licensing begins in early 2027 Mandatory licensing for all game software suppliers takes effect in 2028 Applicants must meet strict fitness and propriety standards plus general requirements from the Finnish Enterprise Act. Only reputable operators will gain market access under these criteria. New Gambling Regulations Impose Strict Compliance Rules The regulatory authority will wield significant enforcement powers, including prohibition orders, administrative penalties reaching up to 4% of annual turnover, and conditional fines for violations. Finland’s approach to player protection goes well beyond basic licensing requirements. Licensed operators face a web of mandatory compliance measures. ID authentication becomes non-negotiable, along with pre-set deposit limits, self-exclusion options, and payment restrictions. Behavioral monitoring systems must identify problematic gambling patterns and trigger timely interventions when risky play surfaces. Marketing faces particularly harsh restrictions under Finland’s new framework. Advertising to minors gets banned outright, influencer marketing disappears entirely, and bonus-driven promotions face severe limits. Interactive marketing, such as two-way social media conversations, becomes forbidden territory, and operators can’t even react to user comments with emojis. All marketing must stay moderate in volume, scope, visibility, and frequency. Additionally, gambling bonuses disappear under the new rules. No-deposit bonuses, campaign bonuses, free spins, and free game money are all prohibited. Finland Establishes New Supervisory Authority for iGaming Finnish gambling oversight will get a complete makeover with a dedicated regulatory body taking charge. The Finnish government proposed creating a new Licensing and Supervision Authority that will replace the National Police Board as the gambling regulator beginning in 2027. Finland’s gaming market will never look the same again. The proposed changes end decades of monopoly control while creating a new path forward that acknowledges what’s already happening on the ground. It will either channel betting money back into legal channels or create new problems the government hasn’t anticipated yet.

2025-08-04T15:36:30,Is Blackjack the Original Skill-Based RPG? A Deep Dive for Canadian Gamers,"We are spoiled when it comes to gaming, as we live in an era of overabundance with dozens of different genres to choose from. Back in pre-digital world, gaming options were much more limited and people had to make do with what was available. Since virtually anyone can get a deck of cards, games like blackjack brought the opportunity to demonstrate mental sharpness and gaming skill in friendly showdowns with friends or strangers. To win at blackjack, it’s necessary to embrace a style and perfect it to the highest level. If that sounds a lot like modern RPGs , that’s because blackjack and similar games provided a blueprint for today’s game developers to follow. Let’s explore this link between card playing and role playing games. The Role of Cards in Pre-Digital Times Computers can instantly simulate as many outcomes as needed, and we are so used to this that we forget how tricky it was to randomise before digital technology was around. You basically needed a physical system that could provide truly unpredictable input, and two of the most convenient ones were playing cards and dice. With a deck of cards, you could play a wide variety of games ranging from solitaire to poker that were suitable for different social situations. Kids growing up in those times would learn a couple of card games before they knew how to read and write. Some card games like blackjack were reserved for adults and often played for small money (and/or bragging rights), providing a ready-made way for a group of friends to have a skill-based competition . Blackjack As A Mix of Skill, Boldness, and Luck To win at blackjack, several factors need to be aligned. This is a game based on random drawing of cards from a deck, but anyone who thinks luck is the primary driver of success knows nothing about it. A good blackjack player needs to have a deep understanding of probabilities and a keen mind to apply them to practical situations. The game also requires a good deal of audacity, and top players pick their spots to take risks and chase a big win. You will still need Lady Luck to smile at you from time to time, but unless you are ready to capitalise when that happens it might all be for nothing. This is why blackjack can be regarded as the prototype of many video games that force the player to make tough choices and wait for the right moment to push forward. Every Blackjack Player Belongs to a ‘Class’ class In role playing games, player’s choices are often formalised as a character class or branch of the skill tree. Specialisation is necessary in order to solve advanced quests and equip powerful items. While blackjack doesn’t offer such nuanced possibilities for differentiation, it relies on a similar principle. Each player approaches the game in a specific way – some are cautious and methodical, others like to be more aggressive and push the limits. These roles can be flexible, but most players adopt a style and try to become very good at it. While it might be a stretch to describe aggressive blackjack players as ‘mages’ and risk-averse ones as ‘priests’, it’s not hard to see that the analogy stands. We can’t really describe blackjack as a true RPG, but some of its characteristics definitely fit the essentials of this genre. Calculating the Odds in Real Time to Gain an Edge Regardless of your preferred style, you must be able to determine your odds of success in every situation and make your decisions accordingly. This is true in RPGs as well as card games, and players who know when to walk away tend to do better in the long run. It all comes down to simple mathematics, but there are a lot of factors in play and the time to crunch the numbers is very short. When they are preparing for blackjack Canada players try to go through as many hands as possible to get a better feel for the odds. That’s quite similar to doing a test run in a video game so you can put together a strategic campaign that uses an optimal character. Are Blackjack Players Good at Video Games? If these games follow a similar blueprint, it would be logical to expect that blackjack players can master RPG games quickly, and vice versa. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. While some skills certainly transfer, every game requires a very specific mindset that can’t just be imported. Even the best blackjack players would need an adjustment period to get used to terminology and the complexity of the interface. Still, if you want to become better at RPG games, practicing a bit of blackjack isn’t the worst idea. The game is deceptively simple but has a lot of depth, and it gives you a chance to determine how high your tolerance for risk really is. Since all you need is a deck of cards or a membership at a Canadian casino site, you can practice as much as you like on your own. The post Is Blackjack the Original Skill-Based RPG?

2025-06-20T20:14:41,Are Sweepstakes Worth It? How No-Wager Sites Have Gained Such a Strong Player Base,"Sweepstakes platforms, also known as social casinos, social gaming sites, or no-wager sites  are currently taking large parts of North America by storm. They’re hugely popular in the United States and are now gaining traction in parts of Canada as well. These risk-free digital entertainment gaming sites don’t involve any gambling, but you must still be at least 18 years old to play on them. The question being asked here is, are sweepstakes casinos worth it? On this page, I will be taking a quick look at why sweepstakes casinos have become so popular in recent years and how they are seen by many as the perfect alternative to regular [real money gambling] online casinos. What are sweepstakes casinos, and why are they so popular? The best way for me to describe a sweepstakes casino, or whatever you prefer calling it, is to compare it to a ‘regular’ online casino. However, the main difference between regular online casinos and sweepstakes casinos is that the latter was created with purely fun, risk-free, and light-hearted entertainment in mind rather than gambling. On a regular casino site, you must deposit money to play their games, but on a sweepstakes site, you don’t have to deposit money to play the games available on that site. Instead of using real money to play sweepstakes casino slots, classic table and card games or scratchcards, for example, instead of using real money, you use one of two virtual coins (aka virtual/digital currencies), which have ZERO monetary value in the real world. All sweepstakes casinos run on this same two-coin virtual currency model, and users often receive X amount of both coins when they sign up to a sweepstakes casino as part of the initial welcome bonus (aka sign-up bonus). If you want to learn more about today’s safest sweepstakes casino sites and the generous welcome bonuses that are currently up for grabs for participants in your region, then I would suggest heading over to the official CasinoTopsOnline iGaming review site, which is run by a dedicated team of writers and researchers who have pointed me in the right direction (to the safest sweepstakes sites) for as long as I can remember. All of their feature brands are free to join and can be easily accessed in your web browser using any decently working, Wi-Fi/internet-enabled desktop computer, smartphone, tablet, or laptop. What’s the difference between Gold Coins and Sweep Coins? These fun gaming sites are popular with players like me who don’t like gambling with real money. The two types of coins I typically receive when I join a sweepstakes casino are called Gold Coins and Sweep Coins (also known as Sweeps Coins). However, I’ve also found that the Gold Coins might be called something different, depending on where you play. I’ve also seen them being called Diamonds, Gems, Fortune Coins, and Rubies, for example. Anyway, these ones are always free, meaning that when you run out, you can top them up for free in several ways. However, if your Sweep Coins run out, the casino won’t top them up for free. Instead, you have the option to get more of these coins, normally by using PayPal or Visa (or whatever your preferred online payment method is) and buying them in bundles/packages that might set you back $5, $10 or $20. No purchase is necessary, don’t forget, and you won’t ever be pressured into buying more. You might be asking yourself, why buy more coins when you can get Gold Coins/Fortune Coins, etc., for free when you run out? The answer is simple. Gold Coins can only be used to play games. They can’t be used to win real-world prizes. In other words, these ones (your Gold Coins) cannot be exchanged for any of the prizes that are commonly up for grabs on today’s best sweepstakes casinos. The prizes that can be won using your Sweep Coins typically include the following: Cash prizes Merchandise Vouchers for your favourite online stores Luxury vacations The latest electronic gadgets Brand-new cars Unfortunately, Sweep Coins have a tendency to expire if they aren’t used in 60 or 90 days (each site is different), so remember to use them before they expire. If you aren’t bothered about winning prizes and just want to play games , then use your Gold Coins, not your Sweep Coins. If you run out, don’t panic because you can ask the friendly and professionally trained customer/player support agents via live chat to top your account up with more Gold Coins, free of charge (no strings attached). Other ways that I’ve found to top up my Gold Coins balance are via on-site promotional offers, daily log-in bonuses, prize draws, raffles, giveaways, newsletters, social media channels, and so on. In other words, they aren’t hard to find and can easily be topped up whenever you run out. Final thoughts Although sweepstakes casinos aren’t gambling sites, I still practice responsible gambling , and I suggest you do the same. For example, if I decide to buy more Sweep Coins for a chance to win some real-world prizes, I always set a sensible spending budget before purchasing more bundles/packages. I would also suggest never logging in to play while tired or intoxicated and taking regular session breaks. Going back to the original question: Are sweepstakes casinos worth it? Based on my personal preference and the risk-free nature of these sites, I would say that the answer to this question is that they are 100% worth it. Unlike real-money casino sites, I’ve found that sweepstakes casinos are far less stressful and more community-driven, meaning they are more focused on fostering a sense of belonging and growing online communities. You can enjoy shared experiences on these sites and forge new friendships with other like-minded players without the fear of losing any money. In other words, if you are looking to play hundreds of world-famous live dealer and computer-generated online casino games from award-winning providers without the risk factor, then you might want to consider trying a sweepstakes casino instead of a real money online casino.

2025-02-02T11:46:38,10 Best PS3 RPG Games of All Time,"RPGs are a way into a new world, where we can be whoever we want to be (unless the character has already been predetermined). On the PS3, there are plenty of RPGs to choose from. Given the scale of the choice, boiling it down to the 10 best PS3 RPG games makes sense. Here are the choices, for you to explore a new world. [1/10] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Release : 2011 Developer : Bethesda Game Studios Publisher : Bethesda Softworks The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a legendary title that Bethesda managed to keep relevant long enough for it to keep players occupied until the next Elder Scrolls release. Featuring the classic Bethesda RPG approach, Skyrim is a pleasure to explore. Multiple quests for various factions, random encounters, and the ability to completely forge your character make the game interesting after thousands of hours. Mods make it even better, though that is not available on the PS3, unfortunately. [2/10] Demon’s Souls Release : 2009 Developer : FromSoftware Publisher : Sony Computer Entertainment Demon’s Souls might seem like it’s part of the Dark Souls series, yet it is more closely related to the King’s Field series. It is an action RPG and knowing FromSoftware, you can expect a decent challenge and a similar system you will later see in Dark Souls. Once you die, you respawn as a soul, but you lose all the souls you collected (it’s almost identical to the hollow system from Dark Souls). There are multiple endings to the game, depending on the path you take and the decisions you make, a staple of good RPGs. [3/10] Dragon Age: Origins Release: 2009 Developer: BioWare Publisher: Electronic Arts Back when BioWare was allowed to make good games, Dragon Age: Origins, took the world by surprise. It is an RPG from the third-person perspective, focusing on the world of Thedas, specifically Ferelden. You are a Grey Warden, your goal is to slay the Archdemon and stop the current Blight. On the road, you gather a party of followers, perhaps even friends and you can choose to help them or ignore them. Depending on your choices, multiple endings are available, making replayability enticing. [4/10] Resonance of Fate Release : 2010 Developer : tri-Ace Publisher : Sega Resonance of Fate is a different RPG in a world where sword and sorcery typically dominate. Guns are not the first weapons that come to mind when you think of an RPG. Once you immerse yourself in the sci-fi atmosphere, then you notice the combination of turn-based and real-time combat. We are set on our lovely planet, but far in the future. The environment is very polluted, and humanity is taking cover under the gigantic air purifier Basel. History is changed and people forget their past, leading to a religious state bubbled, primed to burst at the start of the game. [5/10] Mass Effect 2 Release : 2010 Developer : BioWare Publisher : Electronic Arts Mass Effect 2 is probably the best of the three main games (we don’t talk about Andromeda). It’s everyone’s favorite, mostly due to a perfectly executed story buildup. It is the perfect combination of stakes and suspense, the storm before the bigger storm. The game has decent combat, much better than the previous game, albeit somewhat crippled by the lack of vertical movement. It offers replayability both because you can approach fights differently but also because you can choose a different path in every conversation. [6/10] Persona 5 Release : 2016 Developer : Atlus Publisher : Atlus, Deep Silver Persona 5 delivers an almost classic Persona experience but with modern graphics. Like most Persona titles, you are thrown into a world as a relatively casual person, at least during school hours. It is after school when the fun starts. You build your character during the day, meaning statistics, which are then useful during night runs because that is when you explore the Metaverse. Persona 5 stands out as a great RPG, probably one of the best PS3 games, as well. (link to main PS3 article) [7/10] Fallout 3 Release : 2008 Developer : Bethesda Game Studios Publisher : Bethesda Softworks Fallout 3 is unlike any previous Fallout title, due to the transition to 3D graphics. Following on the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Bethesda followed up with a great game in their post-apocalyptic, tongue-in-cheek series. Fallout 3 lets you explore Washington DC in a world where radiation is one of your main problems, but also huge mutated cockroaches, beings straight out of nightmares, as well as regular humans, looking to get the upper hand. And then there you are, trying to survive. [8/10] Tales of Xillia Release : 2013 Developer : Namco Tales Studio Publisher : Bandai Namco Entertainment Tales of Xillia sends us to a world where spirits can be turned into energy. We follow Jude Mathis on a quest that puts his life and that of his friends and recent acquaintances, in danger. In a world where two factions are waging war, there might be a chance for peace. The game is a traditional RPG in the sense that there is a field or adventure map, fully rendered in 3D, which you use to explore the world and interact with characters. The battles happen on their own separate maps, incorporating real-time battle, though with limited action points. [9/10] Nier Release : 2010 Developer : Cavia Publisher : Square Enix Nier gives us a look into the future, a world that is beautiful, though hardly populated by beings that we would like to interact with. Our protagonist is searching for a cure for their loved one, but that quest turns out to be more challenging than one would expect. This is an action RPG that incorporates real-time combat in a 3D world. The character is controlled from a third-person view, a standard for action RPGs, though perhaps not those from Japan. For its story and its gameplay, Nier remains a game to be replayed to this day. [10/10] Final Fantasy XIII Release : 2009/2010 Developer : Square Enix Publisher : Square Enix Final Fantasy XIII is associated with the PlayStation consoles, at least the versions from the late 1990s and onwards. In a combination of what is sci-fi and fantasy, we dive into the world of Gran Pulse, where Lightning and her companions are on a crucial quest. You move in a 3D world, from a third-person perspective, until you get to a battle. That brings up familiar mechanics from previous legendary Final Fantasy titles , such as Active Time Battle. A combination of a great story, beautiful graphics, and familiar mechanics make FF XIII a memorable RPG. These games are available on the original console, the PlayStation Network , or by using a PS3 emulator . While they might not be everyone’s favorites on the consoles, these are some of the best PS3 RPG games and would be a great stepping stone into a world full of amazing titles and even series.

2025-01-23T22:48:28,10 Most Cheated Online Games of All Time,"Cheating has been a part of online gaming since its inception, turning fair matches into frustrating experiences for players worldwide. Some games, however, have gained infamy for the sheer scale and creativity of the cheats used within them. From subtle aim assists to blatant wallhacks and game-breaking exploits, cheating has left its mark on many iconic titles. Here we explore the 10 most cheated games of all time, looking at how cheats have evolved alongside the gaming industry. Whether it’s for competitive advantage or simply to disrupt others’ fun, cheating remains a persistent issue in some of the most beloved and widely played games in history. Let’s take a closer look at the titles that have become synonymous with this problem. [1/10] Counter-Strike Series (2000-Present) The Counter-Strike series has long been synonymous with competitive gaming, making it a prime target for cheaters. Known for its precise gameplay mechanics and emphasis on skill, this franchise has attracted players who exploit cheats to gain an unfair edge. Common Cheats: Aimbots: Automatically lock onto enemies for effortless precision, particularly devastating in high-stakes matches. Wallhacks: Allow players to see opponents through walls, nullifying the need for tactical positioning. Triggerbots: Fire automatically when a target enters the crosshair, giving cheaters an almost inhuman reaction time. Despite its reputation for hosting some of the most skilled players in the world, the competitive nature of Counter-Strike has fueled the rise of these cheats, keeping it firmly on the list of the most cheated games. [2/10] Call of Duty Series (2003-Present) The Call of Duty series stands as one of the most popular franchises in gaming, renowned for its fast-paced multiplayer modes and strategic gameplay. However, its widespread appeal has also made it a hotspot for cheaters employing a variety of hacks to dominate matches. Common Cheats: Aimbots: Deliver near-perfect accuracy, making every shot count and leaving opponents no chance to retaliate. ESP (Extra Sensory Perception): Enables players to see through walls, detect enemy positions, and track movements in real time. Radar Hacks: Display all enemy locations on the minimap, removing the need for tactical awareness. Understanding the dynamics of these cheats and how they impact gameplay can give players a deeper appreciation of the challenges developers face in keeping matches balanced. Platforms like SecureCheats provide insights into gaming trends and tools, helping players stay informed about evolving technologies in the gaming world. [3/10] Fortnite (2017) Since its release, Fortnite has redefined the battle royale genre, drawing millions of players with its vibrant visuals, fast-paced gameplay, and building mechanics. However, its immense popularity has also made it a breeding ground for cheaters, eager to exploit the system for quick victories. Common Cheats: Aimbots: Lock onto opponents with deadly precision, turning intense firefights into one-sided battles. Building Exploits: Manipulate the game’s signature building mechanics to create unfair advantages during engagements. Radar and ESP Hacks: Reveal enemy locations, loot spots, and movement, stripping the game of its tactical unpredictability. The competitive nature of Fortnite, particularly in tournaments and ranked play, has made it a frequent target for cheaters. While the game’s ever-evolving updates aim to address exploits, the cat-and-mouse dynamic ensures that cheats remain a constant challenge in the community. [4/10] PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG, 2017) As one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) quickly became a global phenomenon. Its realistic gameplay and high-stakes matches attracted millions of players—and a significant number of cheaters eager to exploit the system. Common Cheats: Speed Hacks: Allow players to move faster than the game permits, giving them an unfair mobility advantage. Aimbots: Guarantee headshots and perfect accuracy, making them nearly unstoppable in firefights. Invisibility Glitches: Make cheaters undetectable, rendering them invulnerable to normal gameplay strategies. PUBG and its focus on survival make it a prime target for cheaters who disrupt the natural flow of matches. Despite efforts to curb these exploits, its reputation as a heavily cheated game persists, further cementing its place on this list. [5/10] Apex Legends (2019) Apex Legends brought a fresh perspective to the battle royale genre with its innovative gameplay mechanics, unique characters, and dynamic team play. However, its rapid rise in popularity also made it a target for cheaters looking to climb the competitive ranks unfairly. Common Cheats: Auto-Aim: Ensures pinpoint accuracy, often resulting in instant eliminations during firefights. Wallhacks: Reveal enemy positions, allowing cheaters to track opponents through walls and terrain. Rank Exploits: Manipulate the matchmaking system to achieve higher ranks without legitimate gameplay effort. Apex Legends, especially in ranked modes, has made it particularly vulnerable to cheating. With hackers employing advanced tools, fair players often face uphill battles in maintaining their standing on the leaderboards. [6/10] League of Legends (2009) As one of the most iconic multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, League of Legends has attracted millions of players over the years. Its competitive gameplay and strategic depth, however, have also drawn cheaters seeking shortcuts to victory. Common Cheats: Scripting: Automates champion abilities and movements, granting inhuman precision and reaction times. Bots: Used to farm experience and resources in low-level matches or idle accounts for profit. Zoom Hacks: Alter the game’s camera limits to provide an extended view of the map, giving cheaters superior vision and map awareness. The prevalence of these cheats has posed challenges for players striving for genuine skill-based progression, solidifying League of Legends as a game often associated with cheating controversies. [7/10] Grand Theft Auto Online (2013) Grand Theft Auto Online offers players a sprawling open-world experience filled with heists, races, and endless possibilities for chaos. However, the game’s expansive multiplayer environment has become a haven for cheaters, often referred to as “modders.” Common Cheats: Unlimited Money Mods: Grant cheaters infinite in-game currency, bypassing the need to earn resources legitimately. God Mode: Makes cheaters invincible, nullifying all attacks and in-game consequences. Environment Manipulation: Allows players to alter the world around them, from spawning vehicles to creating impossible obstacles for others. The sheer scale and flexibility of GTA Online have made it fertile ground for inventive cheats that disrupt gameplay and create chaotic scenarios, reinforcing its reputation as one of the most cheated games. [8/10] Team Fortress 2 (2007) A pioneer in team-based multiplayer shooters, Team Fortress 2 has maintained a loyal fanbase for over a decade. However, its long lifespan and accessible mechanics have made it a prime target for cheaters looking to exploit its system. Common Cheats: Triggerbots: Automatically fire weapons when an enemy enters the crosshair, giving cheaters a significant advantage. Wallhacks: Allow players to see opponents through walls, undermining the game’s strategic dynamics. Backtracking Cheats: Manipulate hit registration to ensure attacks land, regardless of timing or positioning. Adding to the chaos, bot infestations have further tarnished the experience for legitimate players, making cheating a constant challenge in this classic game. [9/10] Overwatch (2016) Blizzard’s Overwatch revolutionized team-based shooters with its unique hero roster and emphasis on strategic gameplay. However, its competitive appeal has also made it a hotspot for cheaters seeking to gain an advantage in matches. Common Cheats: Aimbots: Ensure perfect accuracy, especially with heroes that rely on precise aiming like Widowmaker or McCree. Input Macros: Automate complex hero abilities, allowing cheaters to execute perfect combos with minimal effort. Wallhacks: Reveal enemy positions, removing the element of surprise and disrupting tactical play. Despite its emphasis on teamwork and fairness, Overwatch remains a target for cheats that compromise the integrity of its fast-paced matches. [10/10]When gaming got unfair 10. Valorant (2020) As a tactical shooter focused on precision and strategy, Valorant quickly became a competitive sensation. However, its rapid rise also attracted cheaters who sought to exploit the game’s mechanics and dominate matches unfairly. Common Cheats: Triggerbots: Fire automatically when an enemy enters the crosshair, giving cheaters a split-second advantage. Wallhacks: Reveal enemy locations through walls, negating the importance of map knowledge and positioning. Aim Assistance: Provide pinpoint accuracy, often making cheaters nearly unbeatable in firefights. The competitive structure of Valorant, with its emphasis on ranked progression, has made it a magnet for cheaters seeking to climb the leaderboard without putting in the effort. Cheating has become an unfortunate reality in online gaming, affecting even the most iconic and competitive titles. From the tactical precision of Counter-Strike to the open-world chaos of GTA Online, these games highlight the persistent challenges developers and players face in maintaining a fair gaming environment. While cheats may offer short-term advantages, they undermine the integrity and enjoyment that make gaming such a compelling experience. Whether you’re a casual player or a dedicated competitor, supporting fair play is essential to preserving the spirit of these beloved games.

2025-01-08T22:02:32,Top 5 Most Watched in eSports Tournaments,"From a few players locked up in their basements to booking out and selling major arenas, eSports certainly has come a long way. With viewership numbers now in the millions, it’s interesting to look at the most-watched tournaments in current eSports history. Whether it’s League of Legends or CS: GO, there’s an eSports event based on popular games for everyone to enjoy. This of course is not something which is confined purely to pro gaming circles around the world. iGaming in Canada highlights this perfectly and has really taken off in the province of Ontario, due to the presence of iconic games for people to try there. Roulette in Ontario has proved to be especially popular and helped the provinces’ newly regulated iGaming market to flourish since launching in April 2022. When talking about eSports events featuring top games though, what are the most watched ever? 1. League of Legends 2023 World Championship As shown at Statista , this was a huge event in eSports history and picked up a massive amount of viewers. It therefore makes it a must for this list and not something which can be forgotten about. The tournament itself, which took place in San Francisco, clocked in at 6.4 million concurrent viewers across all channels. The jaw-dropping final match between the South Korean DRX and the Chinese T1 saw the South Koreans win with a final score of 3-2. The closeness of this result made it a jaw-dropping spectacle and one that really kept viewers enthralled. It was also clear that the sheer number of people watching the tournament was a testament to Riot’s success in developing its eSports scene in Southeast Asia and China. 2. Free Fire World Series 2021 Singapore Free Fire is a mobile game that stemmed from a PUBG clone. Quickly, the game introduced its own unique mechanics and adequately diversified itself to start competing with the game from which it was inspired . This all culminated in a 5.4 million player viewership in its 2021 World Series, taking place in Singapore. Thanks to the pandemic with everyone at home, Free Fire saw a large increase in its player base, which naturally led to increased viewership numbers in all Free Fire tournaments that year. While the game is still popular, it hasn’t nearly matched the numbers it once had. 3. Mobile Legends M5 World Championship Stemming off as a League of Legends clone, Mobile Legends was mobile-first from the start. Capitalizing on the success of League, Mobile Legends focused on introducing easier mechanics for a mobile experience. Because of this, players who were fans of League but liked to game on the go were hooked. Couple that with good updates and developers who genuinely cared about the experience, the Mobile Legends M5 World Championship saw a whopping 5 million viewers tune in to see the Filipino AP Bren win the finals. 4. PUBG Mobile Global Championship 0 PUBG Mobile put in a lot of effort to grow its mobile eSports scene, especially because Free Fire had a head start in the SEA region. While they never met the same numbers, the first season of PUBG Mobile’s Global Championship stood out at 3.8 million players. Taking place in Dubai and organized by Tencent, the developers pulled all the stops to turn the tournament into success. While they couldn’t replicate Season 0’s success, it did set up the stage for PUBG Mobile to become a major eSports player and directly led to the game having a consistent player base thanks to its pro scene. 5. CS:GO PGL Major Stockholm 2021 With 2.75 million players, CS:GO’s Majors have been happening for decades now, and it is quite surprising to see a 2021 event top the list in terms of viewership. The simple reason behind that is, again, the pandemic. However, beyond that – PGL Majors have always been iconic, and the 2021 iteration was no different. With star-studded rosters and one of the best finals of all time between NaVi and G2 (with NaVi not losing a single map in the entire map), the tournament displayed the absolute domination that the European team had on everyone else. Conclusion There are two interesting takeaways from this list of the most-watched tournaments in current eSports history. Firstly, mobile tournaments clearly have a broader viewership . This is primarily because they simply have more players, as games are easier to play on a phone than virtually any other platform. Secondly, viewership numbers did peak around the pandemic, particularly around 2021-2022, when most were clumped up in their homes. While 2023’s LCS didn’t happen in that timeframe, it is clear that a lot of games hit their peak numbers during that time.

2024-11-21T22:42:56,10 Best PS3 Racing Games of All Time,"Racing or driving games have always been popular, since the console days of the 1980s, from titles like Outrun to today’s hits, which are also on the PlayStation 3’s list of games. Even though everyone will have their favorite title across different generations of consoles, here are the 10 best PS3 racing games of all time. [1/10] Gran Turismo 6 Release : 2013 Developer : Polyphony Digital Publisher : Sony Computer Entertainment Gran Turismo 6 is one of the most-sold PS3 games. The entire franchise did well on all PlayStation consoles, including the PS3. As with most Turismo games, you can expect an arcade and realistic career mode. They differ in how much effort you must put into the game. Besides the classic fun versus realistic action that Turismo games offer, this title also introduces some concept vehicles, and futuristic cars that change things up. Change is good, which Polyphony Digital implemented masterfully in this game. [2/10] Burnout Paradise Release : 2008 Developer : Criterion Games Publisher : Electronic Arts Burnout Paradise is a video game that was praised enough to get a remaster available on both the PS4, Xbox One and eventually, the Nintendo Switch. There were several things that made it stand out among the plethora of racing games, and it wasn’t the pretty graphics. Decent graphics are always a good starting point, but gameplay does matter, especially in a racing game. Burnout Paradise is an open-world game, where players can explore and race freely, adding to the overall immersion. Notable elements from previous titles return with a different name, such as Showtime, which used to be known as Crash Mode. [3/10] DiRT 3 Release : 2011 Developer : Codemasters Publisher : Codemasters DiRT 3 is the continuation of the Colin McRae racing series and is the first game in the title to drop the iconic racer’s name. That being said, the game does continue the fine tradition of offering one of the best off-road racing experiences. The Dirt Tour is the primary game mode, a way for players to live the life of an off-road racer. Other game modes return, with new ones such as Gymkhana, where racers pull off various tricks to earn points, much like you would see with skateboarding at the X Games. [4/10] Wipeout HD Release : 2008 Developer : SCE Studio Liverpool Publisher : Sony Computer Entertainment Wipeout HD is the next step in the anti-gravity racing series, featuring tracks from the PSP Wipeout Pulse and Pure, though brought up to PS3 specs and 60 FPS. We now race in the FX350 anti-gravity league, where corporations have their own racing teams. Like most Wipeout titles, expect fast-paced action with power-ups along the tracks. They can be offensive, defensive, or utilitarian, all with the purpose of helping you win the race. This version got an expansion called Fury, which was eventually remastered for the PS4. [5/10] Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Release : 2010 Developer : Criterion Games Publisher : Electronic Arts After the Underground duology, Most Wanted, and Carbon, we get Hot Pursuit, a reboot of the eponymous title from 1998. The focus is on racing while being chased by the police. You can also take the role of the police and focus on stopping street racers. Unlike Criterion’s previous game, Burnout Paradise, this one is not as much of an arcade game, but also definitely not a simulator. It does have a larger open world and the racing can be entertaining. Licensed cars are a huge difference, as every vehicle in the game exists in the real world. [6/10] F1 2013 Release : 2013 Developer : Codemasters Birmingham Publisher : Codemasters F1 2013 gives players the opportunity to enter the Formula One 2013 season as a professional driver. The game features all the 22 drivers and 11 teams from the season, as well as the 19 circuits. It is fully licensed and a gem for F1 fans. But not everyone is a fan of modern racers. For those players, the Classic Edition of the game is there to provide vintage racing fun, namely from the 1980s and 1990s. The latter decade does require a separate pack to be purchased. [7/10] Midnight Club: Los Angeles Release : 2008 Developer : Rockstar San Diego Publisher : Rockstar Games Rockstar Games tends to have a couple of hits and Midnight Club is a gem in the racing genre. Known typically for their immersive, open-world games, Rockstar delivers an open-world racing game that knocks the previous games in the series out of the park. Set in Los Angeles, the player can enjoy a 24-hour day and night cycle, with real-time weather that affects vehicle performance. There are various races and ways to advance your career, but beware of the police, they won’t take your speeding and reckless driving lightly. [8/10] GRID Autosport Release : 2014 Developer : Codemasters Publisher : Codemasters GRID is more of a racing simulator than an arcade title, and that captures the attention of those more interested in a realistic feel when driving their virtual cars. This can be seen through the damage system. Car parts eventually wear out, losing performance, and requiring the player to change them. The player’s career is divided into seasons when you can sign with different teams. You can also enter different categories of races, depending on what you prefer. Ideally, you want to be the best in all of them, but that takes time and dedication. [9/10] Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Release : 2012 Developer : Sumo Digital Publisher : Sega Sega did wonders after abandoning hardware manufacturing after the poor sales of the Sega Dreamcast . That meant focusing on game development and working with other console manufacturers closely, bringing us great titles such as this. Sonic was already popular, so combine that with racing, and you get a truly unique racer. Featuring characters from the Jet Set Radio series, Space Channel and Sonic, you have plenty of icons to choose from in this karting marvel. [10/10] MotorStorm Release : 2006/2007 Developer : Evolution Studios Publisher : Sony Computer Entertainment MotorStorm is a racing game that combines various vehicles to give you a unique off-road experience. From bikes to monster trucks, anyone can enter a race. Fair isn’t the point, but rather arcade fun, tuned so that every vehicle can win. A notable feature in the game is the dynamics of the tracks. They get damaged or rather, changed by the passing of the vehicle. Every lap will be different from the last, so don’t count on that one move to save you. MotorStorm is an iconic title, probably one of the best PS3 games.

2025-12-17T08:03:31,Phoodle Today Answer – DECEMBER 17TH,"Looking for the answer for Phoodle Today ? Well, you’ve arrived in the right place. In this guide, we’re going to provide you with the answer to today’s puzzle. We’ll also keep this guide updated with the solution for every subsequent puzzle. With that in mind, we recommend that you bookmark this page and check back daily so you never get stuck again. Phoodle is almost the same game as Wordle but with one key difference: all of the words you’re guessing are based on food. That could be a type of food, a famous culinary personality, or, well, anything related to that world. It does help you narrow down your guesses though, but the actual game remains similar. Guess a food word, green letters are in the word in the right place, yellow are in the word in the wrong place, and the rest of the letters aren’t in the word. You can play Phoodle on the official website . If you’re a fan of games like this, check out our Semantle Today Answer and Waffle Game Today Answer . Phoodle Today – Answer Here is the solution for today’s Phoodle puzzle: December 17th : PACKS Phoodle FAQ Now, we’ll answer a bunch of questions you may have about Phoodle. What Is Phoodle? Phoodle is a Wordle-like daily puzzle game that challenges you to guess a specific word every single day. Unlike Wordle, in which the word can be anything in the dictionary, Phoodle focuses on food-focused words. This could be a type of food, a famous chef, or a technique performed while making food. There’s a surprising amount of depth. How Does It Work? Well, pretty much like Wordle. Guess a word (remember, it has to be food-based), and any letters that appear in the word in the correct place are marked green. Yellow letters are in the word but in the wrong place, while uncoloured letters don’t appear in the word. You use these clues to help narrow down the correct word. Got Any Tips and Tricks? Vowels: A similar strategy to Wordle works well here. Start by using words with plenty of vowels, as they appear in most words and will give you a good jumping-off point. Try and use all vowels in your first two words. Food: After this point, think of food, or food-related words that have letters in the place described. You should be able to make some ground here. Definition: If you’re still struggling, our definition above can help. It’s not quite as simple as giving you the answer straight up. That will do it for our Phoodle Today guide.

What’s more, we keep this article updated every single day, so if you’re a big fan of Semantle, and often struggle to get the right answer, we recommend that you bookmark this page and check back often.

Semantle Today – Answer The answer for Semantle today is: December 17th : JET Semantle FAQ Now, we’ll answer the many questions you may have about Semantle. What Is Semantle? Semantle is a Wordle-like daily puzzle game that, like its inspiration, challenges you to guess a specific word each day. Unlike Wordle though, you don’t get clues based on the letters you pick, but on how close the word is semantically to the answer. You get a score based on heat – hot being closer to the actual word – and have to use that to try and guess the word in a set number of goes. How Does It Work? You guess a word and are given a score on how close your guess is, semantically, to the answer that day. Each subsequent guess also gets a score until you get it right, or run out of guesses. So it’s very similar to Wordle, just focused on similar words rather than correct letters. Got Any Tips and Tricks? Hint: You don’t get punished for using the ‘Hint’ feature, so go crazy. It will give you a word and a similarity to the actual word, so it’s giving you a single free go per day. Don’t waste it. Use a thesaurus: If you’re getting close, with a similarity score pretty high, try and narrow it down using a thesaurus. This will give you similar words to play with. Definition: Lastly, use our definition above! That will give you a good idea of what the word is to help you solve it, without actually giving the game away. That will conclude our Semantle guide.

Start playing The Forge via Roblox . For more on The Forge, find out if the first two minigames contribute to forge quality in my experimental guide! Best Areas To Farm Miners Shards in The Forge As of the BETA release, there are only two ways to get the Miners Shard Runes. This includes defeating Delver Zombies from the Stonewake Cross caves, or defeating Bomber Skeletons from the Sunken Cells or the volcano entrance rear within the Forgotten Kingdom Caves. Delver Zombie Location: Stonewake Cross Sub Locations: The Cave, Inner Cave, and Deeper Cave Layers Level range: 1-10 HP: 40-175 DMG: 12-30.4 Miner Shard Drop Chance: 1 in 35 Bomber Skeleton Location: Forgotten Kingdom Sub Locations: Crumbling Halls, Sunken Cells, and Ashen Passage Level range: 1-5 HP: 60-120 DMG: 70 DMG Miner Shard Drop Chance: 1 in 15 Despite having more serious damage overall, the Bomber Skeleton has a few seconds’ grace period before it detonates and deals that much damage. In that time, if you have a weapon capable of killing it, you won’t sustain any damage and reap all the rewards. I’m emphasising the Bomber Skeleton too, as it has a higher chance of dropping a Miner Shard, alongside other useful materials such as larger Essences, Boneite, and Blast Chips. Mining Shard Variants Mining Shards are the ideal counterpart for Pickaxes with Rune Sockets. Unlike other Runes, Miner Shards have tons of variation as opposed to only some or none. Luck : 5-16% Luck Increase on the Pickaxe. Yield : 3-10% chance for nodes to drop an additional Ore. Swift Mining : 4-12% Faster Mining. Mine Power : 8-15% extra Mining Damage. If sold to Greedy Cey, Mining Shards yield $25 per Rune. What are Runes? Runes can be socketed to Pickaxes, Weapons, and Armour to enhance their versatility. In the case of Mining Shards, these only apply to Pickaxes to make mining more efficient and fruitful. Runes drop from a series of enemies you encounter, primarily in the Forgotten Kingdom and beyond. If you want to enhance your equipment on a budget without investing in new tools, then Runes might be your go-to for that cutting-edge!

2025-12-16T15:39:12,Is the Fisch Scavenger Enchant Worth Using?,"The Fisch Scavenger enchant increases your chances of getting rare catches. You should always enchant your best rods in Fisch ! Perhaps one of the latest Fischmas Rods is worth enchanting? Fisch Scavenger Enchant Is it one of the best enchants? How to Get the Scavenger Enchant Luckily, the Scavenger enchant can be obtained at random via a regular Enchant Relic rather than the rarer Exalted Relic. However, due to there being a wide variety of enchants in Fisch nowadays, it can be tricky to get the exact enchant you want. What Does the Scavenger Enchant Do? When using a fish rod that has the Scavenger enchant, there are three main buffs that it provides. 3x higher chance to catch: Treasure Maps Threads Nukes Enchant Relics 1.5x higher chance to catch Atomic Nukes 1.75x higher chance to catch Exalted Relics Enchant Relics The item you have to use to enchant your fishing rod! It’s always a good idea to have some of these as spares in case you want to reroll the current enchant, or you get a new fishing rod Nukes Nukes usually have a 1 in 10,000 chance of appearing when you fish. However, with the Scavenger enchant, there’s a 3x higher chance of catching one. After obtaining a Nuke, you can activate the Nuke event by letting it detonate or by failing the minigame. The Nuke event lasts for 30 minutes and summons an area which guarantees all caught fish will have the Nuclear mutation. This mutation increases the selling value of the fish by 6x! There’s also a 0.001% chance of being able to purchase a Nuke from the in-game Daily Shop. Atomic Nukes Atomic Nukes work similarly to regular Nukes in the sense that they are both events that take place within a certain radius. When an Atomic Nuke detonates, it summons an area where all who fish within it are guaranteed to catch fish with the Atomic mutation for 45 minutes . This mutation increases the selling value of fish by 8x. Additionally, this is the only way to get the Skeletal Serpent , granting a 0.05% chance of catching it. Other than using the Scavenger enchant, you have a 1 in 75,000 chance to catch Atomic Nukes naturally when fishing. It also has a chance to be in stock in the Black Market and costs 100 million coins . Treasure Maps With a Treasure Map, you can go on your own treasure hunt! Speak to Jack Marrow at Forsaken Shores to unlock the full set of coordinates on the map. Once you have the coordinates, you can set sail to your destination. I recommend using the GPS item for this, as this is the only way to see coordinates on your screen. After finding the Treasure Chest , you can open it to receive random rewards. Threads There are four different types of Thread to obtain in Fisch: Lunar Thread Regular chances: Fishing: 0.1% (must be during the Moonlit Mirage event) Treasure Chests: 16% Aquarium: 0.1% Daily Shop: 0.63% (costs 250K coins) Fallen Stars: 2.38% Magic Thread Regular chances: Fishing: 7% Treasure Chests: 16% Aquarium: 1% Murky Thread Regular obtainment: Complete the Forgotten Temple’s ‘ Puzzle Room V ‘ Ancient Thread Regular chances: Fishing: 0.5% Treasure Chests: 9.5% Aquarium: 0.5% When using a fishing rod with the Scavenger enchant, you have a 3x higher chance of catching any one of these Thread types! Exalted Relics This Relic type offers different enchants when compared to regular Enchant Relics. These enchants can only be obtained via Exalted Relics: Herculean Control increases by 0.2 Maximum weight increases by 25kg Progress Speed increases by 10% Anomalous 20% chance to duplicate fish Piercing Progress Speed increases by 15% 30% chance to ‘stab’ fish, increasing Progress by 6% Sea Overlord Increases the size of fish by 40% Invincible Grants infinite maximum weight The fishing rod can be used in the Brine Pool and the Roslit Volcano Quantum Increases Resilience by 25% 25% chance to catch Subspace fish (increases selling value by 6x) Immortal Progress Speed increases by 30% Luck increases by 75% Mystical Lure Speed increases by 15% Luck increases by 25% Progress Speed i ncreases by 10% Resilience increases by 45% The post Is the Fisch Scavenger Enchant Worth Using? appeared first on Gamezebo .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.449908,Adele Wilson,Gamezebo,https://www.gamezebo.com/walkthroughs/fisch-scavenger-enchant/,92d4dcfc057542dd4e2c8dbdb1890d53e86512d7,914,en,0.1,The Fisch Scavenger enchant increases your chances of getting rare catches.

2025-12-16T15:18:03,Do The First Two Minigames Affect Forging Quality in The Forge,"Do the first two minigames affect forging quality in The Forge ? Find out in my article that puts this question to the test with experimentation, explaining more about how Forging works, and how to perfect it! Start playing The Forge via Roblox . For more on forging, check out our Best Armour Recipes guide and Best Weapons Recipes guide ! Contents Do The Minigames Affect Forging How to Play The First Two Minigames Experimental Forging Forging Gamepass Do The First Two Minigames Affect Forging Quality in The Forge In short, yes, the first two minigames contribute to the overall quality of your completed Forge. This is important as your performance will determine how good your overall equipment turns out, including high DEF armour, high DMG weapons, and overall monetary value. How To Play The First Two Minigames The first minigame happens after you choose your Ores and press Forge. The game requires you to bring the Ores to their melting temperature by pumping the furnace to make the kiln hotter. Once the temperature reaches maximum, you move on to the next minigame. The second minigame is a pouring game. You need to line up your white line with the moving yellow box to pour out your smelted Ores. This game completes when the bar at the bottom is full. For both minigames, there are no timed tasks like the final minigame. It’s easy to think they’re less vital and just for show, as you can take as long as you want. However, in the next heading, I’ll prove why you don’t want to be tardy about your initial forging games. Experimental Forging I took it upon myself to give this a try before curating this article. To ensure fairness, I used x3 Cobalt per forge to ensure a 100% chance to obtain a Dagger. Since there are three Dagger variants, I sold and redid the experiment if I got a different version from my first Excellent/Perfect quality Cobalt Dagger. When performing poorly in the first two minigames: Craft Quality: Rough (21%) DMG: 5.22 ATK Speed: 0.35s Selling Price: $41.29 When performin g excell ently in the first two minigames: Craft Quality: Excellent (92%) DMG: 8.26 ATK Speed: 0.35s Selling Price: $65.35 This proves that the first two minigames matter, as on the third and final one, I aimed to get Perfect on each strike. To fail the first two minigames, I would take too long, let the kiln cool down, and pour out slowly, ruining the flow of the craft. I also noticed that the Attack Speed remains the same. Whether this is true for rarer weapon types or rarer Ores is uncertain. But, with the selling price and main function taking a hit, I wouldn’t risk finding out. Forging Gamepass If you struggle with the first two games or want to bypass them entirely, you can purchase the Fast Forge Gamepass for 299 Robux. This Gamepass skips the initial two games, moving onto the final one, where you hammer your equipment in time with the circle.

2025-12-17T10:29:41,Larian and Bloomberg clarify statements on AI usage in Divinity development,"Following the release of an interview between Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, there’s been a hefty stink caused by the mention of Larian using generative AI as a tool for the development of Divinity . This has led to Vincke and Schreier to both issue statements and provide greater context, downplaying even further the extent to which generative AI is being used. The main sticking point was the use of gen-AI to produce concept art, but Vincke has now stressed that Larian has a significant pool of concept artists, job openings for more, and that gen-AI isn’t producing concept art itself, but could create reference material that artists would previously have looked for photographic reference material for inspiration. Aside from that, from the broader Bloomberg interview transcript, it’s placeholder text and white box assets, internal powerpoint presentations, Vincke himself using it to brush up his own emails (given that English is a second language). The problem really stemmed from the brevity and some framing of Bloomberg’s original section about generative AI : Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in Divinity — “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text. The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said. Note the use of “pushing hard” and that there has been pushback in the studio. On social media , Vincke has now responded to the concerns that artists were being replaced: Holy fuck guys we’re not “pushing hard” for or replacing concept artists with AI. We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do. I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists. We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison. I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more: Gamespot We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier. In the Gamespot article, he describes the AI use as often being for work and jobs that “nobody wants to do”. And to circle back to Bloomberg, on social media, Schreier (who somehow didn’t expect that AI use would be controversial) said, “If I had known the two paragraphs about genAI in my article today would be so controversial, I would have expanded them a bit! Here’s a rough transcript of the relevant portion of my interview with Swen Vincke, so everyone has all the context. “I am not sharing this transcript because I think it will make anyone view Larian’s stance on genAI any differently; I’m sharing it so people can see all the context and judge for themselves if they feel that Larian’s position was misrepresented by my story.” Here’s the rough transcript: JS: Speaking of efficiency, you’ve spoken a little bit about generative AI. And I know that that’s been a point of discussion on the team, too. Do you feel like it can speed up production? SV: In terms of generation, like white boxing, yes, there’s things, but I’m not 100% sure if you’re actually seeing speed-ups that much. You’re trying more stuff. Having tried stuff out, I don’t actually think it accelerates things. Because there’s a lot of hype out there. I haven’t really seen: oh this is really gonna replace things. I haven’t seen that yet. I’ve seen a lot of where you initially get excited, oh, this could be cool. And then you say, ah, you know, in the end it doesn’t really do the thing. Everything is human actors; we are writing everything ourselves. There’s no generated assets that you’re gonna see in the game. We are trying to use generated assets to accelerate white-boxing. But I mean to be fair, we’re talking about basic things to help the level designers. JS: What about concept art? SV: So that’s being used by concept artists. They use it the same like they would use photos. We have like 30 concept artists at this point or something like that. So we bought a boutique concept art firm at the moment that everybody was using reducing them because they were going to AI, in our case it just went up. If there’s one thing that artists keep on asking for it’s more concept artists. But what they do is they use it for exploration. JS: The other thing that I’ve seen that being used for more and more is placeholders, stub dialogue. SV: Well, yes. So it depends on the scripter. In our case what we do is whiteboxing means that the scripts put stub text in there. Some scripters will probably use a chatGPT, some will write it themselves. It’s really up to them– JS: But you found that it’s not actually speeding things up. It’s just kind of allowing more experimentation. SV: Well, in the sense that speeds it up because your experimentation is broader. But I mean, it’s not as if their dialogues are suddenly being written faster. And on the contrary, and it’s not as if you’re seeing the scripting going faster. What’s happening is there’s just more stuff being done, but I mean if you’ve used chatGPT, it helps you organize things, gets you a faster- JS: Until it screws up and– SV: Right. You still will always have to alter it yourself. And I mean like I’m non-native English, so it’s easier for me to make my phrases without mistakes. So it helps with that. JS: To write your company emails. SV: No, no, no, no. I mean I like putting it in there to see okay, this is a clean version of my text. So what’s happening is I write with worse grammar now and then I use it to clean up my text and then I have to go over it again to clean it up again. JS: That seems like it would take more time. SV: Yes, I know. But I have the feeling like my phrases are better. JS: Your English is pretty good. You don’t have to worry that much. SV: I think experimentation, white boxing, some broader white boxing, lots and lots of applications and retargeting and cleaning and editing. These are things that just really take a lot of time. So that allows you to do more. So there’s a lot of value there in terms of the creative process itself. It helps in doing things. But I haven’t seen the acceleration. So I’m really curious to see because there’s all studios that said, of this is gonna accelerate… If you look at the state of the art of video games today, these are still in their infancy. Will they eventually manage to do that at large scale? I don’t know how much data centers they’re gonna need to be able to do it. JS: It doesn’t seem like it’s causing more efficiency, so why use it? SV: This is a tech driven industry, so you try stuff. You can’t afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you’re not using it, you’re dead this industry. JS: OK, but the downside though is that it’s so poisonous, controversial to players, to artists, to creative people in a way that other tech isn’t. Maybe Photoshop used to be back in the day? SV: I think you would find the same argument back in the days for a lot of things, right? Anything that was has been automated has always considered – I think the part of this job is to make sure that you are competitive and state of the art. So if you don’t look at the state of the art, you will eventually regret it. That’s gonna be even worse for developers. So what do you think? Is Vincke too casual about the impact of generative AI? Is that offset by the way that it’s being used internally and that it’s supporting a company that continues to grow? There’s definitely a lot of nuance here.

2025-12-17T09:00:08,Nacon RIG R5 Pro HS Gaming Headset Review,"In recent years, the most reliable headset brand, at least for my ears, has been Nacon RIG. For years, their industrial looks have been married to high-quality gaming audio, and that’s seen them remain a firm favourite in our home. So, it’s with some surprise that the latest RIG headset, the R5 Pro HS doesn’t actually look like any of the headsets that have come before it. This much more restrained and customisable design still hosts RIG’s excellent audio, though, making this a late peripheral highlight in 2025. The R5 Pro HS is a 3.5mm wired headset, meaning that it’s compatible with anything hosting a headphone socket, including PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s often nice to have the simplicity of a wired headset; you never have to remember to charge it, or place it on a dock, it’s just ready to go. That simplicity extends to the R5’s controls, with an inline volume control sitting midway down the cable, itself boasting a slide control that clicks into place at full volume. It was always easy to find the control when I needed it, and I appreciated the fact that it was right there, whether hitting louder sections in a game, or needing to turn things down to hear somebody talking to me. The microphone is similarly straightforward, with a flip-to-mute action that stops its output when pointing straight up. The boom arm is made of flexible metal with a rubberised coating, giving it a decent degree of movement and optimisation that sees it stay exactly where you put it. The mic itself boasts a 50 Hz–15 kHz frequency range, and it proved perfect for game chat and the odd Zoom call, though I do think I’d look for a dedicated mic if I was streaming and talking to an audience. While there’s elements of the older RIG headset design language if you look really closely – you can see it in the squared-off bottoms of each earcup – Nacon have clearly decided to move towards a more modern and understated overall look. That means that the R5 Pro HS have lost some of the character of those older headsets, but you could actually wear these outside of your home without drawing any side eye. It’s clean, confident, and I like the shift in design as we head into 2026. The R5’s little party trick is that it has customisable magnetic plates on the outside of each earcup, letting you add a touch of your own personality to them. It’s a decent enough idea, and one we’ve seen before with headsets like the Turtle Beach Elite Pro 2, but there, the support for different plates dried up pretty quickly. Nacon don’t want that to happen. Instead, even before their own options are available, they’ve released the STL files, letting those with access to 3D printing get started making their own plates straight away. This means that players will be able to create their own, completely unique plates, and I can see it being a popular headset, simply for this level of customisation. Out of the box, you’re getting two PlayStation-branded covers, but if you want to remove them, the R5 Spear Pro not only gets even lighter and easier on your ears, it gives it a real retro vibe that I definitely enjoyed. Comfort isn’t an issue, with or without the plates, and the magnetic ear cushions – which you’ll also be able to buy alternate versions of – are thick, soft and plush. I was able to wear the R5 Spear Pro for days on end, helped by the ample padding on the headband, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable, easy-to-live-with headset. In terms of audio, the R5 Pro HS’s 40mm graphene drivers do a fantastic job of delivering all of your gaming needs directly into your ears, in suitably detailed form. I’ve been playing a ton of Skate Story , and it was the ideal game to test them out with. The soundtrack, composed by Blood Cultures, had plenty of menacing thump, though the bass was never overwhelming. The R5 Pro HS are more bass-heavy than the recent Turtle Beach Atlas 200 , meaning that action games and bass-heavy music tracks have some serious weight. If you’re so inclined, the R5 Pro HS are a decent option for listening to music as well. Besides mainlining the Skate Story Vol. 1 album, I’m still stuck on President’s King of Terror EP, and the aggressive guitars and electronic tones sounded great, with some decent spacing in the soundstage. They might edge towards the mid-range a bit more than some other headsets out there, but away from music, it means that dialogue and speech rings through that step clearer than elsewhere, and the wider soundstage means that you feel truly enveloped by the game worlds you’re exploring. With an RRP of £69.90, the key competitor to the R5 Spear Pro this holiday season is the Turtle Beach Atlas 200, and it’s a tough battle as they’re both excellent wired headsets. The build quality of the R5 is definitely stronger, has better audio, and I much prefer the design, but the Atlas 200 probably just edges it in terms of comfort, thanks to its lighter weight. If you’re looking for customisation though, the R5 is the clear winner.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.477683,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/nacon-rig-r5-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/,889f53d967947663eab7c921313a194230b5f751,919,en,0.1,"In recent years, the most reliable headset brand, at least for my ears, has been Nacon RIG.

2025-12-16T23:08:32,Songs of Silence gets a massive update in the Celestial Church DLC,"If you’ve not come across it yet, Songs of Silence is one of the most beautiful fantasy tactics games you’ll ever see. Originally released in 2024, this hybrid RTS/autobattler – with a smidgen of deckbuilding – boasts some truly incredible art nouveau visual design. Characters, artwork, and the different unit classes, sing out from the screen, blessing you with their stunning, evocative looks. Luckily for us, the beautiful action doesn’t have to finish quite yet, with the huge Celestial Church DLC arriving today, bringing with it a host of much-requested features. The and biggest and brightest inclusion is six all-new singleplayer campaign chapters, the six-hour-long additions furthering the story and deepening Songs of Silence’s lore, bringing all that incredible artwork to life in a more meaningful way than ever before. There’s then the addition of a new faction, the titular Celestial Church, who in turn have brought a host of new units, abilities and cards to bear on the battlefield. I can’t wait to test them all out in the coming days. The expansion was shaped by recurring community requests for additional story-focused experiences. Throughout its development, Songs of Silence has evolved hand-in-hand with player feedback gathered from open betas, surveys, and daily conversations between the team and the community. It’s not about to stop here either, with Chimera confirming that another expansion is planned for mid-2026, accompanied by numerous additional features that will arrive beforehand. “Players asked for deeper narrative experiences, and the Celestial Church expansion is our answer to that call,” said Songs of Silence’s Executive Producer, Hendrik Lesser. “We’re excited to keep enriching the game and delivering meaningful content for years to come.” I loved Songs of Silence at launch, and of course, I was utterly taken by the visuals, saying, “Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.”",2025-12-17T11:45:54.479172,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/songs-of-silence-gets-a-massive-update-in-the-celestial-church-dlc/,309cc11aca4c67f712631aa8fb22be0103184189,920,en,0.1,"If you’ve not come across it yet, Songs of Silence is one of the most beautiful fantasy tactics games you’ll ever see.

2025-12-16T20:09:35,Terminator: Survivors delayed and will not have co-op multiplayer,"I don’t think it is too much of a surprise that Nacon has confirmed Terminator: Survivors will not be releasing in 2025 given how close we are to the end of the year, and the lack of news over the past while. Nacon has also stated there is no confirmed new release date, and there will be some changes to the game too. The major changes are that Terminator: Survivors will now not have a co-op multiplayer mode, and there will be no Early Access. Instead, Nacon is changing its plans to release the game in full in one go. In a statement, Nacon said, “After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “Terminator” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer. We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day. We’ve also had to overhaul our release plans, instead of launching in early access, we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience. You might have guessed already, but that means Terminator: Survivors won’t be launching in 2025. We don’t have a new date locked in, but we’ll let you know when we’re ready to share a new release date. Nevertheless, your feedback is a crucial part of our development process, and so we’ll be organizing several closed playtests (under NDA) as the launch window gets closer. If you’re interested in taking part and helping us shape the future of Terminator: Survivors, you can sign up here .” Terminator: Survivors is a sequel to Terminator 2. The story is set in 2009, a time before John Connor’s resistance has risen up against the machines. You are a survivor and do not have much information as to what brought about the apocalypse. However, as you build up your base and scavenge through the surrounding areas, the narrative running through the game will see you learn about SkyNet, about the emerging resistance and more.

2025-12-16T16:53:44,"Larian confirms Divinity will be turn-based, go through Early Access, and how they’re using AI","Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke has revealed some key details about the freshly announced Divinity and the direction that the studio is heading with their game creation. In short, Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based RPG, building on the successes of the Divinity: Original Sin games and Baldur’s Gate 3. He also stated that they will bring Divinity first to Early Access, just as they did for BG3, and divulged just how Larian is using generative AI within the creative process, and how that gels with needing humans to actually make games. “It’s a turn-based RPG featuring everything you’ve seen from us in the past, but it’s brought to the next level,” Vincke said in an interview with Bloomberg ahead of Divinity’s announcement. He also discussed the split from working on a Baldur’s Gate 4, saying that “Conceptually, all of the ingredients for a really cool game were there except the hearts of the developers,” and that instead of using tabletop system, “Here, we’re making a system that’s made for a video game. It’s much easier to understand.” Vincke said they plan to do an early access release of Divinity, and that, while 2026 is not an expected release for this, the development cycle is hopefully going to be shorter than it was for Baldur’s Gate 3. He’s aiming to release much sooner, as “I think three to four years is much healthier than six years,” Vincke said. Is AI a part of that? Larian has invested pretty heavily in bringing generative AI into how the studio works, but with the company now standing at 530 employees globally, this is still a huge studio. Larian is now larger than Insomniac Games or Naughty Dog, which is honestly quite surprising. Vincke says that there won’t be AI-generated content in Divinity, but the AI tools allows for things like developing concept art, dropping in placeholder text, for internal powerpoint presentations and more quickly exploring ideas. At the end of the day, Vincke states that “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves”, and that while there was some pushback internally, “I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it.” Even so, the use of generative AI within the game development pipeline could be a bone of contention for the studio’s fans and gamers at large. In the instance of generating concept art, it can be seen as a tool and aid for the artists at the studio, but it could still mean that there’s fewer artists employed by Larian or less work being outsourced, and what images and artwork were the models they’re using trained on? Larian will have to be vary careful to ensure that no AI-generated concept art of placeholders slip through to any public builds of the game, that’s for sure. But if you’re excited for Divinity and want to play something that’s been created before the widespread proliferation of AI in game development? Well, Divinity: Original Sin 2 just got a free upgrade for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Switch 2, and it’s on sale for all consoles as well.

2025-12-16T15:43:20,Final Fantasy VII Remake demo lands on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S,"As the walls of console exclusivity are torn down for Final Fantasy VII Remake , and Square Enix prepares to release this sumptuous JRPG reimagining on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S on 22nd January , they’ve now given everyone the chance to preview the game on their non-PlayStation consoles with a demo. The content here will likely be quite familiar, as the demo features the first chapter of the game, the Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission. Playing the demo will create save data that can carry through to the main game, and will also reward you with bonus items “Revival Earrings” and “Survival Set”. For Xbox gamers, head to the Xbox store on console, or here in a browser to download the FF7 Remake Intergrade demo. To check out the demo on Nintendo Switch, you can find it on the eShop on console and in browser – see here for the UK store page. Alternatively, Square Enix has created two regional blanket use codes that you can redeem at the Nintendo redemption page here: https://ec.nintendo.com/redeem/ EU/ANZ：D3GM3304HKPBB2VB NA/LATAM：D3GM3304HKQBB2VB Not sure why they did that, but nice. Either way, this gives players a great chance to see how the game holds up on Switch 2 – Series X will obviously be very similar to PS5 and Series S cut down from that, but Switch 2 being lower power and handheld asks for more compromises. As the Intergrade release, this includes both the 2020 original release, and the Intergrade side story that released and enhanced the game for PS5. In our Final Fantasy VII Remake Review , Tuffcub said, “An utter joy to play from start to finish, packed with memorable scenes, moustache-twirling baddies, and epic battles. The first part of Final Fantasy VII Remake isn’t just polished, it’s opulent.” While in our Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review, Nic said, “You should absolutely get Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It’s easy to be critical and nitpick, but it’s worth remembering we’re looking at the DLC for one of the best and most-loved games of the PS4. The PS5 upgrade for Intergrade looks and feels incredible, and the chance to play as Yuffie is warmly received, especially when she completely changes the tone to something more light-hearted. However, the DLC isn’t quite perfect and, despite the filler, it feels very short for its price, especially if you’re not interested in the side missions.”",2025-12-17T11:45:54.484628,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/final-fantasy-vii-remake-demo-lands-on-switch-2-and-xbox-series-xs/,63d19d25218e51d3a071efc1e390a6947be5764f,925,en,0.1,"As the walls of console exclusivity are torn down for Final Fantasy VII Remake , and Square Enix prepares to release this sumptuous JRPG reimagining on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox S",other,0.25
2025-12-16T14:00:59,Aaero2: Black Razor Edition Review,"The original Aaero came out of nowhere, and remains, to this day, one of my favourite rhythm-action games. Merging the classic gunplay of Space Harrier and Panzer Dragoon with musical movement was an inspired creative decision, and Aaero had you riding the rails – called ribbons here – in time with a bass-heavy electronic soundtrack, using your craft to mimic the changing notes. Aaero2: Black Razor Edition sees the Mad Fellows team returning to their signature series, this time boasting a stellar soundtrack from Monstercat, new multiplayer modes, and additional music packs, promising to take players on an even wilder ride through space. Riding the ribbon is an exercise in deft left stick control. You roll from left to right, but as the music features pauses or major note changes, you’ll find yourself launching your spacecraft from point to point, trying to hang onto the ribbon and, in turn, your health. It’s far trickier than it has any business being, but, like a NASCAR driver, this is all about keeping things smooth, gently coaxing your craft around the track. You’ve also got to think about shooting. The right stick controls your weaponry, and you can lock onto enemies by holding the reticule over them, increasing the number of missiles the longer you stay in one spot. If you release your missiles in time with the music, you’ll ramp up your score, and if you get it perfectly on the beat, you’ll immediately reload any empty missile slots. You’ve also got an autocannon for faster-moving enemies, and the better you aim, the more points you’ll earn for each shot. When you’re chasing high scores – each track gives you a star rating and a percentage indicator – Aaero2 gives you a lot to think about. It all fits together perfectly once you’re in the flow of it, even if it feels like rubbing your stomach while patting your head at times. Aaero2 wouldn’t work without a thumping soundtrack to accompany the sci-fi action, and it doesn’t disappoint, with one of the best electronic-infused line-ups since Wipeout. Collected via the Monstercat label – Beat Saber fans will definitely recognise the name – there’s something here for everyone. There’s a trio of MUZZ tracks; Salvation (ft. Bloodhounds) absolutely slaps, while Nemesis is an adrenaline ride of a track. There’s also artists like Habstrakt and Stonebank who keep your sub working overtime, while there’s plenty of light and dark thanks to Hoaprox, YUAN and Haneri collaborating on the more mellow Saviour. This is a soundtrack that repeatedly had me grinning ear from ear, and when it’s combined with the sci-fi visuals flashing past, Aaero2 is capable of achieving the same kind of synaesthesia that you experience in Tetris Effect, Rez and Lumines Arise. In fact, in Aaero2, Mad Fellows have crafted the most Mizuguchi-like game I’ve found outside of his own teams, and that’s a huge achievement. Music is always going to be individual, and produce a unique response, but this feels like a Monstercat album that’s been produced just for me. Aaero2 features a series of daily and weekly challenges, with each task netting you a chunk of extra experience. They might ask you to complete a track without using any missiles, or to beat every boss in one week, but they give you an extra reason to check back in for a cheeky extra track or two, and broadly add some longevity to proceedings, even for the most ardent ribbon-rider. Also, each track’s star and completion percentage tickles the completionist part of your brain perfectly, and you’ll be locking in time after time, trying to perfect one more missile hit, or hold the ribbon just a fraction better. On the normal setting, Aaero2 is a little bit more forgiving on the ribbon riding than its predecessor, locking in more securely, though it doesn’t suddenly make it a breeze by any means. Once you’ve completed your first run through all the tracks though, you’ll unlock Advanced, which removes the magnetic ribbon lock, gives you full ribbons and also more enemies to deal with. This is Aaero2’s true form, with a serious level of challenge, and the opportunity to hit some proper high scores. The fact that there’s Master difficulty above that only goes to show how much challenge the team at Mad Fellows has eked out of Aaero’s gameplay, but no matter what difficulty you’re playing on, it remains utterly enthralling. You can share that experience with others as well. While online leaderboards remain central to the experience – I love reviewing unreleased games, as I’m currently the best in the world at a series of Aaero2’s tracks – the new multiplayer modes let you play in two-player co-op or PvP, both online or from the comfort of your own couch. It adds a new level of competition and collaboration to proceedings, and if you’ve got a similar taste in music to your friends or family, Aaero2 is an absolute blast.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.486611,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/aaero2-black-razor-edition-review/,4842f57bbd4dd1da61e51cc0d41342e7cef9b11f,926,en,0.1,"The original Aaero came out of nowhere, and remains, to this day, one of my favourite rhythm-action games.

2025-12-16T13:00:08,Game of the Year 2025 – Best Narrative,"Why do we love games? The enjoyment is more than just the bright screens and the action taking place, thought that is usually a big part of it. Another is the story and narrative of games, which can go in all sorts of directions and be told in ways that are very different to books, film, or theatre. Many of the most lauded games are celebrated not just because of gameplay, but for the tales of their characters and the narrative we experience alongside them, the ones that draw us in until we’re eagerly reading messages sent between coworkers while hacking their computers. Which brings us nicely to our Game of the Year 2025 Best Narrative standouts. Hundred Line Last Defense Academy is our winner of Best Narrative, or should that be Best Narratives ? A story of 15 students having to survive 100 days while holding back monsters, and dealing with the different relationships between the characters while they fight to survive. It is a mammoth game with players able to work towards a staggering 100 different endings. Putting together one narrative is tough enough for most games, so doing it 100 times over and tying those into every single choice you make is work that should be rewarded. I’m going to quote Miguel here who summed up Hundred Line Last Defense Academy by saying, “It’s this beautifully overwhelming web of stories and paths and branching events where, like, two people can spend dozens of hours playing the game and never have the same experience, or you can just pick it up any time and discover a new story and a new ending. It’s such an insane achievement.” Dispatch – Runner Up The expectations for Dispatch were high, just from knowing that it was coming from a team that had previously worked on Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us. Where would they take their episodic storytelling next? Perhaps to offer a fresh perspective on the superhero genre, while also tapping into and succeeding at creating a heartfelt and funny adventure. You are Robert Robertson, previously known as the hero Mecha Man, who after losing to his nemesis is taken off hero duties and becomes a superhero dispatcher instead, swapping punches for office politics. Office politics are tough enough to deal with, but even more so in Dispatch as you work with ex-supervillains to put them on the path of good. It is also a narrative the explores the themes of identity and learning about who you are as person, while dealing with problems from small issues in the office to life threatening ones that pile on the pressure. Dispatch is a game whose narrative is going to be remembered for a long time. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up Death is hard enough to deal with as it is when it comes for a loved one. The confusion, the grief, the anger, the reflection, and finally the acceptance are all parts of the journey when it comes. But what if you knew when death was coming for you, and not just you but everyone the same age as you? That is the story Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, where a group of people head out to end the Paintress before she paints the number 33 and wipes out anyone of that age. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a strong story supported by a cast of characters that are memorable, leading to you wanting to spend time with them. Behind it all though is the worry that the Expedition, like so many others before, will fail and the Paintress will live to come after the next age the following year. Alongside that fear and worry are moments of joy and wonder, with the world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 providing a stunning playground in which to enjoy the expansive story that has touched so many this year and will do so for years to come. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is not just a game for RPG fans, it is a game for those who love everything about stories.

2025-12-16T11:00:54,The Last Case of John Morley Review,"You’ve almost certainly heard of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, and chances are you’ve also heard of Inspector Morse, Sam Spade and Nancy Drew. Or my personal favourite, Inspector Barnaby  – Tom, not John – though I’m not going to get picky if it means that more murders are committed in Midsomer soon. I’m looking at you ITV. But I digress. There’s one thing that all these names have in common. They’re all super sleuths. Outstanding fictional detectives with household names that crime-solved their ways into our hearts with their lovable quirks and magnificently calculating brain-boxes. And the latest investigator vying to add his name to the list? John Morley, a gritty 1940’s private detective, probing the facts of a case to end all cases in the aptly named video game, The Last Case of John Morley. But will Mr Morley’s name be entered into the fictional sleuth hall of fame? At the start of the game, we meet John Morley in a hospital bed recovering from a previous case that nearly killed him. Returning to his office, he meets with a new client, an old lady who offers him a big wad of cash to solve a cold case; the murder of her daughter two decades ago. And so off Morley pops to a creepy old manor house to do some investigating. There’s no mistaking that The Last Case of John Morley has a brilliant and intriguing story to tell. There were a few jump scares that, although heavily signposted, managed to go some way to construct a suspenseful horror atmosphere, and as the narrative unfolds the player will be treated to some enjoyably surprising plot twists. If you’re a fan of a good mystery storyline, you will be more than satisfied with how the plot unfolds. Sadly, the whole tale is – ironically – let down by the video game medium through which it has been told. For me, the game mechanics, low-quality visuals and character work all got in the way of the storytelling. Let’s begin with the game mechanics. As you guide John Morley through a variety of different rooms, you’ll be prompted to select certain highlighted items of evidence that will be followed by a sentence or two of dialogue from Morley.  The problem arises when the game stops you from progressing until you have selected every single item of evidence available in the room, right down to the last splatter of blood. You may think this a good thing. Surely, this means you’re unlikely to miss out on any evidence relevant to solving the case? Not quite. Despite appearances, The Last Case of John Morley isn’t actually a detective game. It’s more of an interactive walk-through of a mystery story. There are none of the typical game mechanics that you’d expect to find in a detective game – organising and linking evidence, deciphering clues, choosing where to go or who to interrogate next – instead, John Morley does everything for you. You’re just along for the ride. And to point and click. As you can imagine, this quickly becomes overly restrictive, time-consuming and worst of all, boring. Then there’s the clunky visuals. These are particularly grating in the sections where you talk to characters face-to-face. Interrogating witnesses is equal parts terrifying and painful to watch. Their wide eyes stare, unblinking, through the screen, their faces blank and unmoving except for their bottom lip that bobs up and down like a puppet in an attempt to match the words being said. How can you tell if a character is lying if they always have the same vacant look on their face? If you want the player to connect with the emotions of the story, facial expressions need to be the priority. Perhaps you’re hoping that the voice-over work might save the day. Inject a bit of energy and atmosphere into proceedings. Unfortunately, it doesn’t. The voiceover work is some of the worst I’ve heard. I felt I could have produced a less-wooden performance from my satnav. This is such a shame because the dialogue in the script is actually really great! The performances sap any atmosphere out of proceedings and will leave you wondering whether AI actors would actually be so bad after all. And the worst part? You can’t even skip ahead. There’s no reading the subtitles then hitting “next” to minimise your suffering. Plus, you have to ask every question available to you. You have to listen to it all. Every. Last. Wooden. Word. All in all, The Last Case of John Morley has a storyline that you’ll want to inhale in one sitting. If you could read it in a book. Not play it as a video game.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.488595,Laura Hill,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/the-last-case-of-john-morley-review/,a4e33a5f32c109822c119f8e66473878a1edf971,928,en,0.1,"You’ve almost certainly heard of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, and chances are you’ve also heard of Inspector Morse, Sam Spade and Nancy Drew.

2025-12-16T09:14:18,"Silksong free DLC revealed, with Hollow Knight Switch 2 Edition also in the works","Team Cherry is signing off 2025 and the long-awaited release of Hollow Knight: Silksong this year by announcing… more Silksong! The team is cooking up the first expansion for the series, in the form of Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow, which will be available as free DLC. Not only that, but there’s a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for the original Hollow Knight , which also has improvements for other version in the works. With over 7 million purchases of the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and many more on Game Pass, Team Cherry writes that “most importantly, we wanted to say a huge thank you to all the players who’ve braved Silksong’s distant and dangerous lands. “It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further.” So that’s what they’re doing with Sea of Sorrow, which continues Hornet’s adventures in a new nautical themed expansion, a free expansion at that. It will bring new areas, bosses, tools, and more to toy around with. But that’s not all, because the team is also working on an updated version of Hollow Knight for the Nintendo Switch 2 for release in 2026. This will bring high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and additional graphical effects that were not included in the base Switch release. All platforms will be updated alongside this to bring some new features and bug fixes, and PC players can test these right now with a public beta branch on both Steam and GOG. This includes proper 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support (great for Steam Deck players), and a list of fixes and improvements as follows: Added support for 21:9 & 16:10 resolutions. Game now pauses while in inventory menus. Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options>Controller>Advanced Settings) Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding. Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room. Reduced Grey Prince Zote’s stagger bounce height. Updated Sly’s Great Slash collider to closer match visual. Salubra’s Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul. Map panning is now smoother Various smaller fixes and tweaks.

2025-12-15T23:55:07,Wardrum is what would happen if you mixed Fire Emblem with Parappa the Rapper,"I love a good elevator pitch, and Wardrum, the latest from Team17 Digital and Mopeful Games, has an absolute doozy. “Fire Emblem meets Parappa the Rapper” sounds absolutely brilliant, but only if you can wrap your head around a world that mixes those two utterly different games together. What could it possible mean? Well, Wardrum is a Tactical Rhythm Roguelite – though, that alone would make it Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch – that’s taken a note out of games like Parappa the Rapper, or perhaps the Mario and Luigi games, so you have to perform your actions in time with the music to maximise your damage, or secure your defence. Whatever it turns out to be like, the idea of it alone already has me sold. The beat-heavy trailer gives you an impression of what kind of beats and tunes you’ll be banging along to, and there’s already some Patapon-like tones in there that have me even more excited. Wardrum is set in a harsh and unforgiving fantasy landscape, and you have to plan and execute your tactical moves in time with the primal pounding of a tribal wardrum for maximum impact. Off-beat magic has infected the lands, neighbouring settlements have fallen and it’s up to you and a band of five warriors to keep the beat. You’ll have to venture out into the harsh fantasy world and stop the source of this off-beat threat once and for all. We’ve seen a number of games marry turn-based combat with timed elements, not least one of this year’s biggest hits, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Given how successful that game has been, maybe the general public will be more open than ever to a cool, well-executed tactical game with rhythm-action elements. Your ongoing quest will take place across six distinctive biomes with randomised map paths, navigating through battles, sanctuaries and other events to go toe to toe against dangerous bosses. Alongside the big guys, there’s a great lineup of 35 menacing enemies that require careful tactical planning to overcome. If you’re a fan of Fire Emblem, Wardrum looks like it’ll give you a very different take on tactical action, and it’s one that I’m already looking forward to trying out.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.492067,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/wardrum-is-what-would-happen-if-you-mixed-fire-emblem-with-parappa-the-rapper/,31a6f508f64cdb0eb6de9b5a9d56435cc974bd31,930,en,0.1,"I love a good elevator pitch, and Wardrum, the latest from Team17 Digital and Mopeful Games, has an absolute doozy. “Fire Emblem meets Parappa the Rapper” sounds absolutely brillia",other,0.25
2025-12-15T21:52:00,"Bungie confirms a new Marathon release window, game changes and price","Bungie has released a new ViDoc for their upcoming extraction shooter Marathon , confirming a new release window for the game, changes that have been made since the delay , and setting a price. Marathon will now launch in March 2026 for PS5 and PC, and it comes with a $39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99 price tag. Since the game’s delay earlier this year, Bungie has been playtesting in private and gathering more feedback, making the following changes to the game: Proximity chat is now featured in the game Rook is a new solo scavenger character type Solo Runner queue Updates to visual fidelity across the board These are really key changes, given the success and popularity of Arc Raiders. Proximity chat that enables collaboration with other players ad hoc has greatly shaped the gaming community within that extraction shooter, and having a solo queue has enabled distinct playstyles. The Rook character shell is specifically designed to enable you to join matches in progress, coming in with less gear but more potential to quickly scavenge and get out. Also important is the change to the visuals, which will allow for dead runner bodies to remain in the world, adding a darker layer to the sci-fi visuals. All of this is good (and so too is a price point that matched Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders), but we’ll have to wait and see if this helps the game come out from under the long shadow cast by its aborted announcement earlier this year. The game’s public testing and the reaction to this went so badly that Sony and Bungie had to pull back to avoid another Concord -like disaster. Bungie has also been under pressure with Destiny 2, the company enduring rounds of layoffs last year, following the launch of Destiny 2: The Final Shape , and some underwhelming reactions to the Edge of Fate expansion this year, which they’ve finally admitted was a misstep and will work to rectify.

2025-12-15T19:13:55,Pax Autocratica enters Early Access February 2nd,"Multiverse has revealed that its mashup colony sim and roguelite first person shooter Pax Autocratica will launch into early access on February 2nd. A new trailer has been released to confirm the news of the release, showing elements of the colony building and the first person shooter action. You can get a glimpse of Pax Autocratica below. In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state. You might be wondering where the first person shooting comes into all of this. Well, you are not the only civisilation around. There are other regimes in the Tyris System and each one presents a danger. The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists. Multiverse made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying, “1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.” Pax Autocratica has so far only been confirmed for PC.

2025-12-15T18:30:36,Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven launches January 22nd,"Devolver Digital has confirmed that Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven, the new DLC content for the sheep based strategy game, will be launching on January 22nd. As part of the announcement, a new trailer has been released with a majority showing an animation that seems to set up events, while the latter part gives a look at some of the gameplay in small snippets. In Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven players are tasked with finding the souls of dead Lambs for Yngya, the God of Winter. With each soul, Yngya gets stronger and the challenges for the Cult can get more difficult. As well as appeasing Yngya, you need to survive the cold winter that has descended on the land. You will need to keep cult members fed and warm so they do not freeze, there are new traits and quests to discover, and you will be able to expand your base. There are also new structures such as the Exorcism Altar, and you can expand the base with new shops and a ranch. Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven will also have two new dungeons, and those are Ewefall and The Rot. Ewefall is the exterior snowy part of the mountain which is the domain of Marchosias, the leader of the Free Pack.

2025-12-15T16:18:14,Arc Raiders’ Flickering Flames event comes with a mean Cold Snap,"Embark has revealed what’s coming to Arc Raiders this week, as the game embraces the end of year festivities in one way, and the cooling weather in another. There’s a new Cold Snap map condition to endure, and Flickering Flames to warm you up when you get back to safety. Cold Snap is a new map condition from 16th December, as brutal cold and blizzard can roll in and force you to approach scavengine missions in a different way. Embark say, “The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.” And with the difficulties above, Speranza is also having to endure food scarcity and rolling blackouts by gathering in candle light and sharing what little they have. Flickering Flames is the name for this event, which runs from 16th December through 13th January. You’ve got two new major goals when heading above the surface, looking to gather the Candleberry Bush which sustains the city through the winter, and also light and heat sources to boost morale. Candleberries and light and heat special items will be rewarded with: Raider Tokens New items Rare utility items Weapons Cosmetics Merits And then, as a Christmas treat, the second free and permanent Raider Deck is coming to the game on 26th December. This is a string of items to unlock, Raider Tokens and cosmetics,, building up to the hockey-inspired outfit and hockey stick “tool” of The Goalie.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.505955,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/arc-raiders-flickering-flames-event-comes-with-a-mean-cold-snap/,9ef7839943cfcba91f71b3b07416208db3870f1a,936,en,0.1,"Embark has revealed what’s coming to Arc Raiders this week, as the game embraces the end of year festivities in one way, and the cooling weather in another.

2025-12-15T16:00:03,Sleep Awake Review – Enter Sandman,"As creative collaborations go, the combination of Spec Ops: The Line’s Cory Davis and Robin Finck from Nine Inch Nails is as enticing as it gets. When Sleep Awake was first announced, the names involved left me anticipating a thrilling and subversive narrative backed up by a thumping industrial soundtrack. The actual game we got certainly ticks those boxes to some degree, but is it another success story for Blumhouse Games after the excellent Fear The Spotlight? Developers Eyes Out state on their website that they “believe in a powerful synaesthesia emerging from music, narrative, and interactive experiences,” and this manifesto perfectly explains the nature of Sleep Awake. Mixing traditional first person exploration with surreal live action cutscenes, and with all the action being accompanied by a superbly varied and atmospheric score, Sleep Awake takes the ‘walking simulator’ and makes it far more cinematic in scope and feel. It feels strange that this title hasn’t been released on VR devices to be honest. Regardless, it is essential that you play this through decent headphones if you can. Sleep Awake takes place in a strange world that has been ravaged by the Hush, a mysterious presence that steals away anybody who falls asleep. The few remaining survivors of this nocturnal apocalypse must find new ways to stay awake by whatever means necessary, but different sects have very different ideas of how to do this. You play as Katja, a young girl who uses combinations of herbs to concoct eyedrops to stave off tiredness whilst other groups prefer pain and/or bodily mutilation to achieve the same goal. Your first actions in the game are to find the herbs around your flat in order to make such a tincture, a tutorial section that works well to immerse you into the game’s world. Once you have made the drops you set out to deliver them to Amma, and then the strangeness really begins. At times, Sleep Awake is visually stunning with neon drenched skylines and dingy, dilapidated buildings at ground level. Other areas feel a little more repetitive but there isn’t much backtracking so the game is always pushing you forward to see new things. Enemies are present but act as moving obstacles rather than antagonists with their presence mostly restricted to several scripted chase sequences and thankfully short stealth sections. The vibe here is very much that of a walking simulator with occasional horror and puzzles to mix things up. The narrative in Sleep Awake is mostly relayed through environmental storytelling (and Katja’s frequent monologues in response to said environment) but there are also microfiches to find that reveal some of the backstory and lore of the world. There are also spiritual echoes called void shadows left by some taken by the Hush. Katja is able to tap into these shadows and reveal the trapped memories within. Whilst it is never really explained  how she is able to do this, the latter parts of the game point to some kind of family connection to the Hush, a connection that is clearly foreshadowing for future entries in the Sleep Awake universe. This points to one of the most divisive aspects of the game – it feels very much like the prologue to a greater story and, as such, is quite a short experience. I took my time and found almost every collectable and still didn’t get to the five hour mark. Let me be clear here, I’m not arguing that games have to meet a minimum number of hours to be considered worthwhile (indeed I’ve given high scores to many shorter and more focused titles) but the story here feels like it stops just as it starts to get going. The pacing within those five hours is a little uneven as so much happens towards the end that the game before it feels more like an opening chapter. I hope that Blumhouse support Eyes Out to continue the story but recent experiences in the world of game development leave me apprehensive.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.507443,Steve C,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/sleep-awake-review-enter-sandman/,453c81ddb81e606511aff0f5592cfe591e2caa4a,937,en,0.1,"As creative collaborations go, the combination of Spec Ops: The Line’s Cory Davis and Robin Finck from Nine Inch Nails is as enticing as it gets.

2025-12-15T15:45:24,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 free upgrade for Switch 2, PS5 & Xbox Series X|S is out now!","Hot on the heels of Divinity’s announcement at The Game Awards (and some rumours swirling ), Larian Studio has announced that Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition is now available on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, with free upgrades for existing owners. Set in Larian’s original fantasy setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2 was an acclaimed sequel to the studio’s turn-based RPG revival through the 2010s – a revival that eventually led to the even more acclaimed and beloved Baldur’s Gate 3 ! While Larian hasn’t dug into the technical details, you can expect that this upgraded release will offer improved resolutions and frame rates compared to the game on original Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. There was already support for 4K on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, but native versions on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S should allow for 60fps.This isn’t a remake or remaster, just a fairly simple port. On PS5, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now simply a cross-buy PS5 and PS4 game – i t’s also on sale for £12.49 right now! On Xbox One and Series X|S the game is now cross-gen – it’s on sale for £14.52 currently. On Switch 2, however, you’ll want to head to the Nintendo eShop and search for the free upgrade pack if you own the game on original Switch. The RRP is £44.99 for the game on Switch 2, but you can currently buy the Switch 1 edition for £22.49 and then upgrade for free, so…. uh…. go and do that instead? While free in most locations, Japan has a nominal ¥100 fee on Switch and PlayStation. In our Divinity: Original Sin 2 review we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”",2025-12-17T11:45:54.508435,Stefan L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-free-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-xbox-series-xs-is-out-now/,75428940ba7dc0cf4bc60fbaa1f476b909b7d8b5,938,en,0.1,"Hot on the heels of Divinity’s announcement at The Game Awards (and some rumours swirling ), Larian Studio has announced that Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition is now a",other,0.25
2025-12-15T15:00:28,Game of the Year 2025 – Best Remake,"It seems just like yesterday we were handing out our Game of the Year 2024 awards, but time has passed and another year is close to wrapping up. Which means it is time for our Game of the Year 2025 Awards! We are starting this year’s awards with one that is the epitome of the saying “everything old is new again”, and that is the Best Remake Award! Which game has come back from years past to grab our attention again? What could be a better winner than Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake for this award? This package takes us back to the very beginning of Dragon Quest, the origin point of a franchise that has enamoured millions of fans around the world, and done it in such style with the use of the HD-2D engine bringing new life to two classics. It is not just the way Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake looks that make it our winner this year. Both games were essentially rebuilt and expanding, adding new stories, party members, changes to the battle system, as well as an orchestral soundtrack. Not only does this remake offer something new to newcomers, older fans of Dragon Quest get a new experience with the remake. Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake is so good in fact that the only negative thing we could find when reviewing it was that progression could be vague. Other than that, the total package offered and the improvements has made Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake our Best Remake of 2025. Yooka-Replaylee – Runner Up Back in 2017, Yooka-Laylee promised to bring back the 3D collectathon platformer in the vein of Banjo-Kazooie. It succeeded, in some ways, but the original release didn’t quite live up to being a bird and bear’s spiritual successor. Instead of letting things lie, Playtonic Games decided to remake the game and re-release it as Yooka-Replaylee . What we got was an experience where the potential of the original release was finally realised with major gameplay improvements and more content. Yooka-Replaylee is a remake that does what a good remake should, and that is vastly improve upon what came before. Quality of life changes has made Yooka and Laylee’s adventure much more friendly for players, which makes it appealing to young and old players alike. The Talos Principle Reawakened – Runner Up How do you improve upon one of the most critically acclaimed puzzle games of all time? Ten years ago The Talos Principle was released to huge acclaim, and this year Croteam re-released the game after upgrading it to Unreal Engine 5, and taking the opportunity to update other parts of the game as well. What we got is a game that retains all of the excellence the original had combining it with a fresh new look, the Road to Gehenna and the new chapter In the Beginning, which added a good few more hours’ worth of gameplay. Perhaps the biggest addition to The Talos Principle Reawakened is the Puzzle Editor, allowing the community to create and share their own challenges with others. That alone makes this remake bigger than the original, as it provides fans with a possible endless supply of content. And providing ways to keep a much loved game active for the long term should be applauded.

2025-12-15T13:00:31,Thief VR Review,"Thief is a series that I’ve always I loved as an idea, but lack the patience to play properly. They’re the kind of game where if you’re spotted by just one guard you are in a bit of trouble, and will likely be reloading a save if there are more than that. It’s the kind of hardcore stealth experience that encourages ghost runs whilst also hoovering up every last valuable you can find on the way. Thief VR isn’t that, really, but it is still pretty good. And it’s also incredibly immersive. Thief VR casts you as the wanted thief Magpie, completing jobs for your handler Cassandra. The voice acting for all the main parts is great, particularly Cassandra and returning classic Thief protagonist Garret, who quickly becomes a magical voice in your head. The story isn’t going to be the biggest draw here – it’s a touch predictable and some of the dialogue is poor – but it does its job well enough, giving you a variety of things to steal and a vague reason for doing it. What this game nails is how you move through its levels. You grab a window and slide it open, grab the ledge and climb through, crouch and then walk over to a chest and pull out your lockpicks. It might not sound like much, but this sequence of actions can vary wildly between VR games. Thief VR just manages to make all of this feel slick and intuitive. The locomotion here is unobtrusive enough that just climbing through a window, peaking through a door, listening to a nearby pair of guards chatting feels incredibly immersive and natural. The levels looks pretty good as well. They’re not the best visuals I’ve seen in VR, but certainly aren’t the worst either. I occasionally stopped to have a look at some of the views, which is a good sign. You will find some poor textures, especially if you stop and look at the foliage as I did exactly once, and the characters all look a bit odd. Even a main character like Cassandra feels a bit like a waxwork model come to life, though she specifically fares a little better than some characters in other games I could mention. Whilst it won’t blow your mind by any stretch of the imagination, the game looks good enough to be immersive. But then there are the immersion breakers, and they’re everywhere. Locomotion is great, but opening drawers is a nightmare. Grabbing a drawer, you open it towards you, let go and… it slams shut again because your hand, which you didn’t move, caught it slightly. You open it again and the loot inside is jittering about and jerking side to side slightly. You collect the loot and try to close the drawer, but it bounces open again despite you being incredibly careful. In the worst case scenario, the loot is clipping through the bottom of the drawer, causing the drawer to either be stuck frozen in space or randomly opening and closing slightly, whilst also stopping you from collecting the loot because it’s stuck inside the wood. Each drawer is usually part of a cabinet that has one to three more drawers on it. It’s difficult to feel like a thief when it looks a lot like you’ve never encountered drawers before and are acting like my nan trying to work a computer. This situation is a microcosm of Thief VR where smaller details break through the great work done elsewhere. Climbing up walls, you can actually grab empty space next to a handhold to keep climbing. If you use a horizontal rope to make your way over a gap, the angles that your in-game wrists stick out at are ridiculous. Sneak up behind a guard, bonk him on the head with your truncheon and he stops to draw his sword before falling to his knees. For everything Thief VR does right there is something else that dims your lantern of enjoyment, leaving you in moodily lit awkwardness. If you can ignore the constant immersion breakers there is a pretty good thief game here, but that’s home brand thief, not Thief the series. The light gem on your hand is binary now, visible or practically invisible, where being lit just means “You are standing in the light, fool!”, which makes getting close to enemies without being spotted rather easy. You quickly get a bow with all the requisite arrows – water, fire, bludgeoning, rope, and those boring pointy ones that don’t do anything special – and your trusty truncheon hangs from your hip so you can sneak up on a guard and bonk them on the head once or twice, depending on whether they’re wearing a helmet. The guard AI is, frankly, abysmal when it’s working, and then sometimes just breaks. A guard walked within a few feet of me while I was knocking out another guard and didn’t notice, but then another guard heard me doing the same one room over. You can hit guards in the legs to bring them down to their knees – handy to knock them out whilst crouching – but sometimes it doesn’t work and they still get their swords out before falling. You can turn the difficulty up, removing assists, but the AI is so poor it still isn’t the challenge it should be. Sometimes, when a guard spots you, he freezes in place, not approaching, attacking, or even speaking. Upgrading your skills and gear doesn’t rely on the money you earn from stealing, but rather on rewards from Cassandra for stealing a certain amount and snagging a relic. These are upgrades like moving quicker whilst crouched (which is absolutely essential, obviously), making less noise when sprinting or landing, or starting a mission with two water arrows. That’s a big one, since you can’t buy more water arrows and have to instead find them lying around in levels, which is just three layers of silliness. All that said, I have found that stealth in VR has made me far more patient than in non-VR games because I’m so much more immersed. I’m not staring at a screen waiting, I’m pressed up against the actual wall myself. The moments where you encounter a tolerable amount of quirks, meticulously sneak into a building, steal your prize, and get away without a sound are still very enjoyable. There are one or two good moments in the story as well, even if it isn’t overly impressive overall – I particularly enjoyed losing my equipment and having to reclaim it whilst escaping from a prison, which is an overused trope, but made it marginally more challenging and enjoyable.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.512404,Gareth Chadwick,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/thief-vr-review/,f62b909bb4a45acd8127202a5ebcd1458db8bfb7,940,en,0.1,"Thief is a series that I’ve always I loved as an idea, but lack the patience to play properly.

Well, OK, so this was actually intended to be a more timely Halloween update developer vedinad says, “but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than i initially planned. anyway hope you like it!” So that means there’s a new map, new character, new weapon, items, enemies and bosses and all of that on top of the bug fixes and new settings. Seems a pretty hefty update, which does actually tie in with the Christmas gift-giving spirit this time of year. Nice! Here’s the full patch notes for Megabonk Spooky Update: New Content New Map New Character New Weapon New Items New Enemies and Bosses New Achievements and challenges Game Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game Bugs Fixed a bug where Giant Fork’s Megacrit didn’t work Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp) Fixed a “bug” where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy. Settings New Game Setting: Advanced Settings – Will enable certain settings that most players don’t need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players. New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -> Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used [Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -> Shwo or hide the HUD [Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -> Skips the chest animation. Note: You won’t be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting. [Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -> Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1) [Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -> Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this) [Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -> Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen. Balancing Tried to fix the “caveman” bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn’t be able to spawn close to you or reach you Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -> 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won’t be OP Chunkers now start with one more projectile Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level. Calcium’s passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6% Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It’s to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you’re veeeryy late game. Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -> 16 Dragon’s Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -> 16, duration buff 1s -> 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -> 4 Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1% -> 0.75%, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2% -> 1.5% Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -> 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn’t make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.

2025-12-15T10:20:02,Edifier Hecate G2000 Pro Gaming Speaker Review,"As you set up your brand-new glowing, pulsating RGB-heavy PC, you’ll likely realise there’s something missing: RGB-heavy speakers to light up your ears with sound! While I’m not sure of the medical or auditory accuracy of that, Edifier seem committed to the cause, with the new version of the Hecate G2000 Pro their latest stereo speaker kit, decked out with some extremely bright neon lights. If you’re into RGB, they might just be the perfect addition to your setup. The Hecate G2000 Pro are, in line with the brand’s visual design language, shaped as a stretched-out hexagon, with our review unit coming with white speaker facades. Central to each of these is the speaker driver, its black surface contrasted by a silver centre emblazoned with the Hecate logo. The rear of each speaker unit is made from clear plastic, exposing the white and silver housing within, and they look smart and futuristic. They are definitely aimed at gamers though, and where you could easily see the Edifier QR65 in a variety of different houses, these feel targeted at someone who wants a particularly flashy gaming setup. There’s a range of support for different platforms, with the G2000 Pro certified for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S via USB-A, alongside Bluetooth connections, and you can also pump audio in via a 3.5mm connection, all of which means you can use them with pretty much any audio device out there. In the box, you’ll find the Hecate G2000 Pro, a power adaptor, as well as a USB-A cable and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable in the box too, so you won’t be searching around for things to complete your setup. The right-hand speaker features a control panel across the top edge, with four buttons giving you access to input selection, Bluetooth pairing, volume, EQ and lighting controls. This is, as with some of their previous speakers, the weakest element, as the input selection simply works its way through a series of clicks, rather than voicing what input they’re connected to, and at various points through our testing I became very confused about why I didn’t have any output from my PC, only to find that the input had changed. The G button runs you through the different EQ settings, with each represented amusingly by audio prompts, so a short musical trill means you’re in music mode, what sounds like a chugging engine is aimed at movies (I think it’s supposed to be a cinema reel turning), and a click and clunk of a gun reloading is for gaming. This all takes a little unnecessary parsing out, and I can’t help but think things would have been a lot clearer with a simple spoken instruction. Once you’re in the correct mode though, the next thing to consider is lighting. You can turn this off and on via the G button, and alter the brightness and setup via the control buttons, but for the sake of ease you’ll need to download the Hecate Gaming App. As apps go, this has to be amongst the most basic I’ve seen in recent years, and it’s disappointing to find that you can only choose between six colours, or a rainbow effect that scrolls through them. If you have an orange light setup – which is what I have – you can forget matching the Hecate G2000 Pro to it, which seems very very odd. The Hecate G2000 Pro redeem themselves somewhat by sounding much better than their app would suggest. There’s a heap of power here, and a pleasingly airy soundstage that adds depth and space to whatever you’re pumping through them. I’ve been checking out President’s King of Terrors EP – that’s definitely Charlie Simpson isn’t it? – and the mix of electronic and rock instrumentation sounded fantastic via the Music EQ setting, with plenty of detail and well controlled bass tones. If you don’t like how this EQ sounds, there’s no option of tweaking or changing it, so you’ll have to search out other EQ options, the availability of which will depend greatly on what platform you’ve got them attached to. Shifting over to gaming, I put the bespoke EQ through its paces with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and its suitably epic Japanese-infused soundtrack, and the G2000 Pro definitely helped to immerse me even further into Naoe and Yasuke’s adventures. Dialogue was clear and carried well above the delicate audio, while the interstitial sound effects helped to round out the world further. Bluetooth audio sounded solid, though the Hecate G2000 Pro is only capable of dealing with the standard SBC codec, so you’re not getting lossless playback or even AAC, and there was a difference in clarity between the USB connection from my PC and the lossy Bluetooth one. That’s not surprising, but I was disappointed to find there was no higher quality codec support when Edifier have put a lot of emphasis on this with their other recent products.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.518851,Dominic L,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/edifier-hecate-g2000-pro-gaming-speaker-review/,abfdbdb2aa9b672f073e3e0431fc9bba17f2b18d,942,en,0.1,"As you set up your brand-new glowing, pulsating RGB-heavy PC, you’ll likely realise there’s something missing: RGB-heavy speakers to light up your ears with sound!

2025-12-13T15:53:14,Something for the Weekend – 13/12/25,"I think I’m just about back to normal after staying up far too late for The Game Awards and then not being able to catch up on sleep the day after. How was that for you, though? Did any big game announcements catch your eye?

In the News This Week Obviously The Game Awards and the flurry of announcements lead a bumper crop of news this week, especially when sprinkling some Day of the Devs on top!

2025-12-13T12:52:25,Why are gamers hoping Highguard will be dead on arrival?,"Closing out this year’s ceremony, The Game Awards gave us our first look at Highguard , an upcoming PvP shooter launching early next year. However, in the time since its big reveal, online discourse surrounding Highguard has quickly turned sour, with the announcement trailer receiving a 10:1 dislike ratio and plastered with disparaging comments. But why has the backlash been so strong and is it at all justified? As far as final reveals go at The Game Awards, Highguard’s debut wasn’t the mic drop moment it was hyped up to be. The short two-and-a-half teaser, while flashy, did little to support the claims being made that this is a truly new breed of online shooter. Even as someone who is excited to get some hands-on time with Highguard – and one of the few people who enjoyed Concord – we had already seen more eye-popping reveals earlier in the show. Highguard didn’t fit the normal template we’ve become accustomed to. Fate of the Old Republic might have been a better closer, dropping a vague cinematic announcement despite being years off from release. Highguard may have received an almighty signal boost thanks to The Game Awards but how many will tune in to play a new hero shooter with MOBA elements in 2026? The biggest problem for new developer Wildlight Entertainment is the ongoing fatigue surrounding the subgenre which, at its peak, unceremoniously eliminated Sony’s big budget contender, Concord . It’s not all doom and gloom for online shooters, of course. Arc Raiders managed to pull it out of the bag for Embark Studios despite the PvP extraction subgenre also showing its age. As long as a game can meaningfully iterate on an existing formula – or appear different enough from its competitors – it has a fighting chance. That’s why some of the knee-jerk negativity surrounding Highguard seems premature. The presence of mounts suggests there will be large maps, with Wildlight labelling the game as a “raid shooter”, meaning that it won’t ascribe to traditional game modes as seen in Overwatch. As for the visuals, which have been called generic and uninspired by online commenters, we can’t help but feel sorry for the art team. Anything particularly toonish or stylised would immediately get called out as derivative and, while some of the character designs don’t scream out to me, I like Highguard’s gunslinging/fantasy vibe. Ultimately, we’ve yet to see the game in action, and we’re always willing to see what a new studio can come up with, especially one helmed by Titanfall and Apex legends veterans. The negative response to Highguard hints at a growing problem in the industry, where commentators are quick to form narratives about a game’s success without ever playing it for themselves. These are the same people who will be desperately watching Steam stats when Highguard launches, salivating at a chance to publish a “dead on arrival” takedown of the game they’ve already got saved in their drafts. Even if Highguard doesn’t live up to the scorching hype levels stoked by The Game Awards, we need to give developers a chance, even if they are iterating on concepts and ideas that feel done to death.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.526787,Jim Hargreaves,TheSixthAxis,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/13/why-are-gamers-hoping-highguard-will-be-dead-on-arrival/,ab60acb2efa2c23fa7ff668b1fa1968878fe404c,944,en,0.1,"Closing out this year’s ceremony, The Game Awards gave us our first look at Highguard , an upcoming PvP shooter launching early next year.

2025-12-13T00:57:19,Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is many years away from release,"Cast your mind back to the days of PlayStation 3 and Xbox One and there was big kerfuffle when certain companies were found to be making CG render trailers of what was meant to be gameplay, and the game usually turned out looking nothing like the renders. These days every game gets announced with a CG trailer and that means you don’t need to have finished the game, or in the case of Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic , maybe not even coded a single line. It turns out the new studio that is making the game was formed just this year and given AAA games take at least four or five years to make these days, you probably won’t be seeing Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic until the next decade.  That is if it ever gets made, Star Wars titles announced at events have a solid track of vanishing in development hell. Star Wars: 1313 was announced at E3 2012 and was cancelled a year later. Star Wars: Eclipse was announced by Quantic Dream in 2021 and we have not seen a single thing about the game since then. Then we have Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic – Remake which was revealed during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021 with Aspyr developing the title. Since then it seems there have been studio troubles and rumours suggest the entire game was scrapped and now Mad Head Games are on the case. Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was announced last night at The Game Awards 2025. “Being set in the past gives us an immense amount of open space to tell new original Star Wars stories, while staying true to the spirit of the galaxy we all love. There are, quite literally, infinite stories to tell. While we will always honor and celebrate the core saga, it’s crucial to explore new territory, meet new characters, and see new parts of the galaxy,” said VP and GM of Lucasfilm Games Douglas Reilly.

2025-12-16T14:00:52,Hotel Barcelona Explores Our Humanity in Fascinating Ways,"The world we live in now is daunting. We are constantly bombarded with headlines and advertisements that either grab your attention or make you want to look away in disgust. Video games help us by allowing us to escape into a worry-free environment where we can confront our problems head-on without any consequences or regret. However, sometimes we should be reminded of the impact of our emotions from playing video games, as I experienced with Hotel Barcelona. While the roguelike gameplay is formulaic through its design, I was intrigued by where the story takes themes like overcoming grief, how we deal with justice, and how we can accept ourselves for who we are. In the game, you play as Justine, a rookie federal marshal looking for a witch who was responsible for the death of her father. She is teamed up with a demonic killer named Dr. Carnival, who just so happens to be possessing Justine to take down other supernatural killers around the surrounding hotel. What I witnessed was a relationship that was strained yet unwavering as the two of them tried to reach an understanding about the mission at hand. Source: Steam. Between missions, Justine and Dr. Carnival argue and bicker. Here, you get to see why they have to work with one another as their ideologies begin to bubble up to the surface. You also see their opposing viewpoints on certain things, like how Dr. Carnival discusses his personal belief on murder as to whether it is justified based on the circumstances. It's conversations like these that give this simple hack-and-slash roguelike some substance, even if the structure of the game is formulaic with repetitive combat. Now, the bosses that you fight in Hotel Barcelona do have intriguing backstories that you learn once you defeat them in battle. Each one is influenced by recognizable horror genres like the baseball-wielding killer Jacob, whose backstory is that of Jason from Friday the 13th. Like the horror icon, Jacob seemingly fell into a lake near a campsite while trying to catch a flyball. Source: Steam There is also the media influencer Eve, who happens to be an alien lifeform who arrived on Earth, disguising themselves as a global fashion model that others find desirable because of their outward appearance. This goes with the Witch wanting to use others by her side because of the obsessions that they have. While Hotel Barcelona has an interesting concept - an undead killer and a capable federal marshal who wants to solve their father's death - I feel like the ideas and themes are much more compelling than the average player realizes. This is certainly something that both Swery65 and Suda51 have meant to tell in the game, even if the combat isn't exactly engaging for long stretches of time. Both creators are definitely game designers who are more concerned with wanting to convey style with imaginative flair than creating dynamic gameplay systems that will surprise and delight the masses. While Hotel Barcelona has combat that can be described as ""janky"" by some, I feel like it doesn't really matter for a game like this, as long as you are engaged with the narrative. There have been plenty of games that don't have high-caliber performances or transformative gameplay, but will influence video games for years to come. Sometimes a video game just needs themes and ideas that will make you think after you finish it. Source: Steam. I would say that Hotel Barcelona is a game worth playing, with engrossing ideas that will make you feel attached to the characters and the story being told. You just need to ignore the repetitive combat, unexceptional enemy design, and shallow roguelike structure. Sometimes, games are at their best when they present their ideas in such gripping fashion that you think about them for several days, if not even for a few weeks afterwards. That's the power of an irresistible theme.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.548115,CJ Wilson,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/hotel-barcelona-explores-our-humanity-in-fascinating-ways/,a77cd4e5b0ad7582e662993161821b2269045695,1016,en,0.1,The world we live in now is daunting.

2025-12-14T14:00:35,An Interview With the Developers of Winter Burrow,"Recently, I reviewed Winter Burrow , an adorable yet deeply real, cozy survival game. Benjamin Salqvist, the CEO and Creative Director at Pine Creek Games, kindly agreed to chat with me about its development! Here's what he had to say. SUPERJUMP Winter Burrow is a 2D isometric survival game where we play as a mouse trying to survive the harsh winter. What inspired the story behind the game? Benjamin For some people it would be a surprise that the zombie survival game 7 Days to Die has inspired the cozy Winter Burrow, but the idea to make a game that explores the cross section between a harsh outside and a warm safe inside come directly from an experience in the game of running around in a cold rainy world shrouded in fog, searching for the base, and while completely frozen finally seeing the warm light from the base through the fog and entering a room with a warm fireplace. I can't remember where the idea with woodland creatures came from, but it just seemed like an exciting twist to the survival genre, and that made me think of the book The Wind in the Willows, which was a huge inspiration, and from there things just popped in by themself. Like, when we decided to go with 2D isometric graphics, Don't Starve naturally popped up and we played that and realised that we wanted something where it was more straight forward to build on your progress instead of losing it all when you die, and that was what started the idea of a cozy more forgiving survival game, which I'm perfectly aware that some people think defies the genre, but we felt it had a potential and it turned out to be true. Source: Steam. SUPERJUMP Can you dive into the mechanics of the game a little? Aside from the usual food, shelter, and defense systems, what else can the mouse do? Benjamin Well, those three things are a big part of the game. But besides that, you can engage in the story of the different characters of the game, and through them, you will progress in not only the story but also the game itself. You can also furnish and decorate your home burrow to make it feel more like home to you. But besides that, the game is mostly about exploring the different woodland areas, knitting nice clothes, and baking warm pies. SUPERJUMP This is definitely an example of a cozy game despite the darker stories of some of the similar titles in the genre. Why did you choose this warm, comfortable tone? Are there darker elements to the game beneath the surface? Benjamin We believe that the contrast between the cozy elements and the darker elements of the game enhance each other, which points back to the initial inspiration, as a warm safe burrow just feels much more cozy when there is a freezing snowstorm outside, in the same way as it is cozier to cuddle up under a blanket on a rainy day than when it's warm and sunny outside. And yes, there are darker elements beneath the surface, but they are not that dark. You can find some unfortunate souls who didn't survive the winter, and some of the characters have some emotional stories to tell, but that is it. Oh, and then the spiders, they put some people off as well. 😄 Source: Steam. SUPERJUMP What was your favorite part of the development process for this game? What was the hardest part of development? Benjamin It's when everything comes together for the first time, and gameplay and visuals and audio are all there, and you play through this game and feel that you are in a different world, that's an awesome feeling after so much pre-production time. The hardest part was probably to find the right balance between cozy and survival. It hasn't really been done before, so we had to move forward on our own, doing trial and error. It's still something we are very aware of and still tweak a bit based on feedback from players. SUPERJUMP Just for fun, what do you think the cutest item or character in the game is? Benjamin I love the Forest Strawberry that the Mole hands you late in the game. It just looks too nice and delicious and has this surprising contrast to the earth tones and winter setting of the game. For characters, it would probably be either the Toad or the Squirrel. Source: Steam. SUPERJUMP Is there anything else you'd like to share with our readers? Benjamin There is actually much to learn about nature and biology by playing the game. The Toad is called Bufo, and the scientific name for the common toad is Bufo Bufo . Or when the aunt is called Betulina, which is part of the scientific name for Northern Birch Mouse ( Sicista betulina ). And then almost all of the plants and growths are from the real world, and their location is usually close to where they would normally grow; for example, the Shrimp Mushroom grows in the pine forest where they usually would. And there are plenty more examples in the game, but I won't spoil more here. 😄 Winter Burrow is available on PC (Steam & Microsoft Store), Switch, Xbox Series, Xbox One, and Xbox Game Pass. You can learn more about the game here .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.548611,Cat Webling,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/an-interview-with-the-developers-of-winter-burrow/,c82c6f470a0ad8c658b5842f80653a2cce66e570,1017,en,0.1,"Recently, I reviewed Winter Burrow , an adorable yet deeply real, cozy survival game.

2025-12-12T14:00:33,Hidden Gems of Game Design Vol 42,"Plenty of amazing games go unnoticed and are not played widely, for various reasons. Maybe it’s a diamond in the rough, or the marketing wasn’t there, or it could be a game ahead of its time. For this monthly series, I’ve asked my fellow writers at SUPERJUMP to pick a game they think is deserving of a chance in the spotlight. Please share your favorite hidden gems in the comments. Josh Bycer Kokoro Clover Season 1 (2022) Source: Steam. As a shocker, it may be surprising to hear that video games are often inspired by anime, and my pick for this month is a game that is meant to take you back to the days of waking up to watch your favorite Saturday morning series. Kokoro Clover Season 1 is an action game where you play a girl who has the power to summon elemental spirits to help her. She must use the power of friendship to save the world from evil. And with that, we’re off on a Saturday morning adventure as we explore the world, meet lots of friends, and get into fights. The aesthetics and style are some of the best parts of the game, complete with its own anime-inspired intro that would have fit right in watching cartoons in the '90s and end credits previewing the next episode. source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPa5i3fuk4 In line with the subject matter and cuteness, this is not a hard game. You begin with the power to do the monkey and become immune to all damage, with each stage usually having one boss fight and one short platforming level. Aesthetics and charm are the reasons to play; however, all the cuteness in the world can’t make you ignore some annoying technical issues. There are no volume sliders, and the game doesn’t work right in full screen. Still, this is a great family-friendly game for anyone looking to recapture the feeling of watching their favorite cartoon. At this moment, there is a season 2 planned and a mini-season available on Steam. Ben Rowan Rytmos (2023) Screenshot by author I came across Rytmos on Steam and grabbed it out of curiosity, drawn in by its unique style and my love for music and quirky puzzlers. Expecting something rhythm based, instead I found a puzzle game with a musical twist. This indie title by Copenhagen-based Floppy Club turned out to be a pleasant surprise, a relaxing line-drawing head-scratcher set across the faces of cube shaped planets. It wasn't what I expected, but after a few levels I was hooked. Each stage is the face of a floating cube or planet in space. The goal is simple enough: draw a single continuous line that loops from a starting point, passes through all the target cylinders, and returns to where it began. The line can only move straight until it hits an edge, and you can't reuse the same path or trap yourself. Early planets are gentle, but later ones had me thinking carefully about how to steer my line around the cube. Screenshot by author It never becomes punishing. Rytmos sits firmly on the relaxing side of puzzle gaming with a fairly low difficulty curve. I breezed through most levels in a try or two, although a few clever layouts took multiple attempts before that satisfying moment of realisation. There's no penalty for experimenting, and rotating the cube to try a different side keeps the mood calm and meditative. What really makes Rytmos shine is how each puzzle becomes a cute little musical journey. The game is arranged like a miniature universe of solar systems, each themed around a different musical style or culture. One moment I was wandering through the smooth melodies of Ethiopian jazz, the next I was nodding to the pulsing thump of German electronica. The soundtrack ranges from Indonesian gamelan to Japanese ambient, so it's full of global character. Screenshot by author Each solar system has its own colour palette and visual identity that matches the music, so every world feels fresh. As puzzles are solved, each line connection adds a note or beat to the background. By the time a cube is complete, you've built an entire track for that genre. The music here is a reward rather than a mechanic, but it's a wonderful one. Finishing a system unlocks an instrument from that culture and lets you play freely on a looped beat. Whether I was tapping on a kalimba, a synth or tweaking a low pass filter, recording a short riff to be saved on a virtual vinyl was a satisfying touch. Screenshot by author The presentation is clean, colourful and smooth, and the sound design is gorgeous. With good headphones the experience is super immersive and relaxing. Rytmos ended up being a zen-like adventure that left me feeling refreshed. If you're looking for a cozy puzzler that explores a wide range of auditory styles and musical history, this is a hidden gem worth adding to your playlist. Anonymous Grand Theft Auto (1997) source: IMDB From fan theories and reactions to release-date delays, not a week goes by without Grand Theft Auto VI making games-industry headlines. While the original from 1997 had frenzied car thievery worthy of its name, its top-down perspective and blocky graphics looked nothing like GTA 6’s near-photorealistic visuals. In the original GTA, you started as a small-time crook in Liberty City before moving to San Andreas and Vice City, locations explored extensively in later titles. They were based in New York City, San Francisco, and Miami, respectively. Instead of a central plot, Grand Theft Auto tasked you with getting points to open up new portions of the game. Points could be earned by clearing missions that usually involved stealing cars or transporting shipments, outside the occasional gunfight. The game’s four weapons (pistol, machine gun, rocket launcher, and flamethrower) were a far cry from the sequels’ massive arsenals. But that kept GTA’s focus on its driving. Despite its primitive visuals, running over pedestrians with a sleek sedan or turning cops into puddles of blood would remind you of its M rating. Driving was a chore, with iffy camera angles that wobbled during car chases putting a dent in your bonnet before the maps’ dead ends did. Liberty City’s bridges made this worse, forcing you to backtrack if you made a wrong turn. While that is a laundry pile of flaws, revisiting the original is an eye-opening experience. The franchise may have hit its stride after switching to a third-person perspective in Grand Theft Auto III, but its first game did have escalating cop chases, tussles with gangs, and epic getaways. It even had pedestrian routines, simulated traffic, and quick responses from ambulances, fire engines, and cops. Grand Theft Auto isn't exactly a hidden gem, but it remains a pilgrimage worth taking before GTA 6 creates ripples across the cultural discourse once more. Thanks for reading! Come back next month for another entry and more great hidden gems to check out.

2025-12-11T14:00:27,"Trust, Tension, and Touch: The Tactile Terror of Little Nightmares III","The third instalment in the celebrated horror puzzle-platformer series, Little Nightmares III , follows best friends Low and Alone as they navigate the shifting dangers of The Nowhere. While this piece focuses on gameplay—especially the haptics design—I’ll touch lightly on a few non-story spoilers from my time with Low. The Tactile Heart of Little Nightmares III Source: Little Nightmares Press Kit. Little Nightmares III is, above all else, a tactile game — one that insists you pay attention to the smallest physical details. From the opening moments, the controller stops functioning as a mere input device and becomes the medium through which Low’s body speaks. The haptics heighten this effect, stitching your tension to his with every subtle pulse and shiver. This begins with the simplest actions. Holding RT to grip a ladder while nudging the left stick upwards doesn’t feel like a standard command — it feels like bracing yourself, hauling weight rung by rung. Many games automatically secure you to ladders, smoothing away resistance. Little Nightmares III refuses that ease; It wants every grip to matter. I learned this immediately when I relaxed the trigger and tumbled off my first ladder. I had treated the game like any other, but it politely corrected me. This deliberate resistance isn’t clumsy design; it’s the point of the entire experience. Smooth, forgiving controls create confidence. These nuanced, sometimes stubborn mechanics create unease, and unease is the emotional core of Little Nightmares. Flipping a lever, turning a gear, edging along a collapsing platform: each action demands precision that mirrors the real-world gestures they mimic. Turn too far, and a mechanism overshoots. Misjudge a ledge and Low slips. These moments aren’t failures so much as beats in an ongoing conversation between you and the world, a negotiation of weight, pressure, and intent. The game asks your body to participate long before your mind has time to analyze. Through constant gripping, crouching, adjusting, and scrambling, you don’t just control Low—you inhabit him. It’s a quiet example of ludonarrative harmony, where mechanics carry the emotional story as surely as any cutscene. Dystopic, Delightful Design Source: Little Nightmares Press Kit. Ludonarrative refers to the relationship between gameplay (“ludo”) and story (“narrative”). When the two align, you get ludonarrative harmony; when they clash, dissonance. Little Nightmares III leans strongly toward harmony. Even before I understood the specifics of the plot — truthfully, I didn’t grasp the full narrative until later, and even then, only after reading more about the game —the feeling of the world was unmistakable. The mechanics and the atmosphere were telling the same story. This isn’t a horror game built on shock or gore, though it certainly offers a few grotesque images and the occasional combat encounter. Its real power lies in how it positions you. The game wants you to feel small and endangered in a world that dwarfs you. Every narrow squeeze, precise jump, or careful shuffle reinforces that imbalance. You’re not told Low is scared; his fear is performed through your cautious inputs, the slight hesitation before a drop, the careful adjustment before a jump. What surprised me most wasn’t any singular scare, but how ordinary actions carried so much weight. Because the controls require steady, deliberate motion, even simple interactions become sources of tension. A climb, a hop across a gap, even shifting a crate—each one is a quiet gamble between you, the controller, and the world’s indifference to Low’s survival. On paper, these interactions are simple. In play, they become stories. Turning a rusty crank feels agonizingly slow when you suspect something is watching. Edging along a narrow beam becomes a minor crisis when your thumb drifts a millimetre too far. The game amplifies these moments by refusing to tidy them up. It doesn’t auto-correct your footing or polish out mistakes. Source: Steam. One of the most difficult challenges in a particular boss sequence wasn’t combat or stealth—it was pressing jump at the correct time. Jumping, a foundational action in most platformers, becomes charged with uncertainty because you know a mistimed release might send Low peeling backwards into darkness. Each jump becomes a small spike of anxiety, giving weight to the action. After many ( many ) failed attempts, jumping became a source of fear, frustration, and even a bit of anger. That tension sharpens whenever danger creeps into the frame. Threats aren’t only visible or audible, they’re physical. In tense sequences, the controller thumps with a slow pulse that seems to settle in your chest. A distant footstep or slamming door reaches your palms a fraction of a second before you register it on-screen. The world doesn’t simply show you fear — it transmits that feeling to you. The controller’s heartbeat grows heavier, more insistent, as if Low's terror is vibrating straight into your hands. You begin to recognize those thumps the way you would musical cues in a horror film — not as a flourish, but as a warning. Something is approaching. Move carefully. Keep your grip. Don’t let go. And once the game has built this steady rhythm of stakes — this constant physical vigilance — it becomes impossible not to grow protective of Low. That heightened awareness, that embodied caution, lays the groundwork for connection. Tension becomes the first thread of attachment, one that naturally extends toward your companion. It makes the presence of Alone feel like more than a mechanic. It feels like relief, like someone sharing the weight you’ve been carrying in your own hands. Two-Character Tactility (Even in Single-Player) Source: Little Nightmares Press Kit. The tactile design doesn’t stay confined to Low—it extends, almost unexpectedly, to Alone. Even in single-player, where she is AI-controlled, the game frames your partnership through shared physical cooperation rather than exposition. You don’t bond through dialogue, you bond through motion. Many of Little Nightmares III’s puzzles rely on synchronized actions: pulling levers together, boosting each other to higher platforms, matching timing across a collapsing structure, coordinating jumps on a trapdoor. In these moments, the controller becomes a conduit for collaboration. You press, hold, and adjust your movements knowing that Alone must respond—and she does. Sometimes I moved to support Low; sometimes I moved with Alone. The boundary between those states blurred so effectively that Alone's presence felt physical, not just programmed. There’s a subtle but important difference between moving for Low and moving with Alone. The former is simple input; the latter begins to feel like choreography. Haul a lever, and she braces beside you. Leap for a distant edge and she catches the opposite side a heartbeat later. These exchanges create a kind of dual-tactile awareness. I feel my character, and I feel the presence of the other. That awareness deepens through Alone’s responsiveness. She positions herself exactly where—and when—you need her. When she clasps your hand and pulls you through a tightening doorway, you feel the jolt of shared momentum. When she darts ahead to finish off one of the game’s unsettling puppets (arguably the most disturbing enemy you’ll meet), you tense instinctively, trusting her to defend Low in the split second you cannot. When she steps beneath a ledge without prompting so you can reach safety, the sensation of collaboration is unmistakable. The game conveys something wordless but clear: you are not alone, even when you’re technically playing alone. Over time, these rhythms settle into your muscle memory. You begin to anticipate Alone’s movements the same way you anticipate Low's. The trust you build isn’t abstract or even story-driven — it’s embodied. It grows out of the same gripping, bracing, and balancing that have defined your entire journey. And once the game has woven that sense of shared physicality into its moment-to-moment play, the emotional connection feels natural; you've internalized the partnership between Low and Alone. Source: Steam. Conclusion What Little Nightmares III demonstrates, more than anything, is that tactile design can be emotional design. The haptics, the grip mechanics, the small negotiations of pressure and timing — these aren’t embellishments. They’re the means by which the player, the character, and the companion become intertwined. Alone doesn’t need dialogue to feel significant. The game’s physical vocabulary does the work for her: your grip, her answer; your hesitation, her support. It’s rare for a game to make trust something you feel rather than something you’re told. Rarer still for that trust to emerge from actions as tiny as holding a trigger or matching a partner’s step. But that’s Little Nightmares III’s quiet triumph. It demands your attention, it borrows your body, and in return, it offers a connection that feels earned, corporeal, and strangely tender amid the dark.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.553572,Amara Doshi,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/trust-tension-and-touch-the-tactile-terror-of-little-nightmares-iii/,758454204116f51a8ab469075e15f5f947c60fdc,1019,en,0.1,"The third instalment in the celebrated horror puzzle-platformer series, Little Nightmares III , follows best friends Low and Alone as they navigate the shifting dangers of The Nowh",other,0.25
2025-12-11T00:33:34,"Donald Trump, the Cannibal: Twenty-Seven Years of Grand Theft Auto Parodies","Rockstar Games is encouraging its fanbase to touch grass again, having delayed Grand Theft Auto VI’s release by another six months. This decision has caused outrage across the world from the cesspools of Reddit to the halls of Poland’s parliament, for some reason. However, the GTA series is no stranger to controversy, from its portrayal of drunk driving, to its potential for drug trading, to its parodies and satires of real-world celebrities. Politicians, lawyers and magnates are among those who have been skewered since the franchise launched, some still with us, others who have since fallen by the wayside. Donald Love Love gives Claude his first mission. Source: Author. There are hundreds of repulsive caricatures of Donald Trump that have appeared in media over the past few decades, showing up in works as varied as Back to the Future to Sin City to Netflix’s Green Eggs and Ham. However, among the most repugnant portrayals is Donald Love, real estate magnate, media entertainment mogul, and cannibal. Love is introduced in Grand Theft Auto III as one of mute protagonist Claude’s numerous bosses, hiring Claude first to stage a jailbreak to get his tai chi teacher out of prison. (His teacher, the Old Oriental Gentleman, had been arrested by immigration authorities.) Love then orders Claude to incite a gang war between Liberty City’s Yakuza and the Columbian Cartel, with the intent of driving down real estate prices, before disappearing from the story. Love recurs in the prequels Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. In the latter, he runs for mayor in the aftermath of Liberty City’s mayor’s assassination at the hands of protagonist Tony Cipriani. (Chipriani? Sipriani? Kipriani? The pronunciation is always unclear.) Love pays Cipriani lavish sums of cash to campaign for him, crush the opposition, and rig the election, before being publicly outed and forced to declare bankruptcy after losing the race. Love later pays Cipriani to destroy an entire city block for him to redevelop, before picking up a deal putting him back in the black. Along the way, Cipriani procures numerous corpses for Love to eat, among them a John Doe, a reporter for the Liberty Tree, and Love’s former mentor, Avery Carrington. Donald Love is a man of refined taste. Source: Author. Love’s failed campaign and bankruptcy are allusions to Trump’s various failed political campaigns and financial endeavors that plagued him throughout the '90s and '00s. His cannibalism is a reference to Trump’s many accusers saying he lacks respect for the dignity of the human body, though Trump has mainly been accused of sexual assault and harassment as opposed to eating human flesh. However, all three games depicting him came out before Trump’s 2016 campaign, making his portrayal hilarious (or harsh) in hindsight. The Statue of Happiness A face only an immigrant could love. Source: Author. The Statue of Happiness from Grand Theft Auto IV is the beaming green statue greeting immigrants as they arrive to Liberty City’s shores—before inevitably being funneled into the city’s prostitution rings, drug-smuggling operations, and Alderney State Penitentiary. Although the statue’s obvious parallel is the Statue of Liberty in New York City, the Statue of Happiness’s face bears a striking resemblance to a former first lady of the United States. Furthermore, a proto-influencer who appears in The Ballad of Gay Tony critically pans the statue, saying, “I could swear that disgusting strange smile on her face reminds me of someone, too. That's the face of a woman who needs some work done, or some action, or both! I mean, she is seriously living a lie, that one, and for what? If I was married to that cold slab of stone I'd be off with any fat bird who'd take me.” The statue’s face is an obvious reference to Hillary Clinton, whose husband did indeed go off with any lady who’d take him, among them Monica Lewinsky. Hillary Clinton, in the aftermath of the infamous San Andreas “Hot coffee” controversy (including a cut sex mini-game still present in the game’s files), threatened numerous legal actions against Rockstar Games. Among them she drafted legislation prohibiting the sale of M or AO-rated games to minors, with randomized audits of stores by the Federal Trades Commission an accompanying fine of $5,000 for selling such games to minors. The bill died in committee; nevertheless, Rockstar was not one to forgive and forget, and so used her as inspiration for an uncanny, clownish statue with a face leering at Liberty City and a backside pointed towards the Old World. While the Statue of Liberty carries a glowing torch in real life, the Statue of Happiness carries a coffee cup, a likely reference to the San Andreas “Hot coffee” scandal. Both statues have the date of American independence inscribed on their tablet, while the Statue of Happiness’s tablet additionally includes a poem reading: “Send us your brightest, your smartest, your most intelligent, “Yearning to breathe free and submit to our authority, “Watch us trick them into wiping rich people's asses, “While we convince them it's a land of opportunity."" Jock Cranley ""We've cared about you for too long! I'm giving you all the finger!"" - Jock Cranley Source: Author. Jock Cranley is a never-seen-in-gameplay former actor who had a prosperous acting career years before the events of Grand Theft Auto V; protagonist Trevor Philips is mistaken for Jock by sightseeing eccentrics Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill , likely due to them both having crazed attitudes. Cranley is also a wife-killer, having murdered his wife Jolene Cranley-Evans by throwing her off a cliff to make it look like an accident after she opposed his acting dreams. Jolene's ghost appears at midnight near where, if approached, she disappears, leaving a single bloody message: “JOCK.” Unlike fellow woman-killer Peter Dreyfuss, there is no way to bring Cranley to justice. Aside from being a wife murderer, Cranley is something much worse: A political candidate. As one of the main candidates in the San Andreas gubernatorial race, he has all the charm of Arnold Schwarzenegger (his primary inspiration) and the moral bankruptcy of Ronald Reagan. Cranley pledges to slash the state's education budget if elected and sell off all state parkland, and publicly admits to hating immigrants, gay people, law enforcement, old women, labor union members, and people with disabilities. He additionally smears his opponent, Sue Murry, to no end, portraying her as an eye-bleeding demon in his attack ads. Unlike the Governator, Cranley appears not to have won the election, as five years later he is a sports commentator for the Maze Bank Arena. Tom Goldberg No, Mr. Goldberg, Niko Bellic kills people. Source: Author. Tom Goldberg in Grand Theft Auto IV is a partner at the law firm of Goldberg, Ligner & Shyster, a hard-hitting pitbull bulldog of a social crusader, and probably a pedophile. Having uncovered dirt about corrupt police officer Francis McReary, McReary sends Niko Bellic to assassinate Goldberg during a job interview. At the interview, Goldberg is friendly with Niko even as Niko pulls out a firearm. From there, Goldberg says, “I’m all about the Second Amendment. Guns don’t kill people, video games do.” (Niko quickly gives him the third eye.) Goldberg is an obvious reference to Jack Thompson, a notoriously litigious lawyer whose targets over the years have included rap music, gay people, and video games. The quote, “Guns don’t kill people, video games do,” has variously been attributed to him among with many variants, though there is no evidence he ever said those exact words. Thompson took on Rockstar in numerous lawsuits throughout the 1990s and 2000s and was ultimately disbarred for his antics in 2008. Thompson furiously threatened Rockstar with further litigation when he learned a parody of himself was going to included in their next game; however he never filed a suit. Niko doesn’t need to kill Goldberg with just a handgun; Rockstar anticipated a wide variety of ways to kill him, such as with a baseball bat, a grenade, a Molotov cocktail, or a rocket launcher. If Niko uses a knife to slit Goldberg’s throat, he can even leave the building quietly without having to flee from the police. Lester’s Targets Yes Franklin, it is. Source: Author. One of Grand Theft Auto V’s most startling mission sequences, in retrospect, is a series of tasks given by hacktivist Lester Crest. Lester tasks protagonist Franklin Clinton with assassinating various corrupt CEOs, among them Brett Lowry, whose pharmaceutical company peddles harmful erectile dysfunction meds; tech mogul Jackson Skinner, who collects and sells his users’ data illegally; and tightfisted cheapskate Isaac Penny, an investor who plans to buy an automotive company and fire a quarter of the workforce to fatten the bottom line. It was jarring on a recent replay to find myself being paid to assassinate morally bankrupt CEOs, after a CEO himself was gunned down in my hometown in real life, allegedly due to his insurance corporation’s morally bankrupt practices. A Steam account purportedly belonging to Luigi Mangione , the accused shooter, does not list any Grand Theft Auto games in the library. He has, however, played some Undertale , so he is at least likely familiar with the concept of pacifism. Jay Norris Jay Norris, seconds from dying. His last words? ""Hello?"" Source: Author. If you’ve ever found yourself fuming over an unnecessary change to Instagram or Facebook’s user interface, or Meta’s support of hate speech, then the mission “Friend Request,” from Grand Theft Auto V is the mission for you. In it, Lester Crest tasks protagonist Michael de Santa with sabotaging the launch of LifeInvader’s new mobile phone. LifeInvader is Grand Theft Auto’s equivalent of Facebook, debuting in V. It bills itself as “The reason the world never gets anything done any more.” Throughout the game, various characters post their responses to the protagonists’ antics as they shoot their way across San Andreas. (Bleeter, the equivalent of Twitter, debuted in 2009’s The Ballad of Gay Tony. As Instagram was not as prevalent in 2013 as it is today, it has no in-universe equivalent.) LifeInvader’s CEO is Jay Norris, having founded Lifeinvader in his parents’ poolhouse in the Carraways (GTA’s equivalent of the Hamptons). Norris boasts about his company’s practices to thunderous applause: “We have put a billion people's private data in the public domain, and we have milked every penny we could in the process. And we have one of the youngest work forces in the world! An average age of only fourteen point four years. That's not just impressive. It's revolutionary!” Aside from selling its user data to corporations, LifeInvader and Norris are implied to be working with the IAA (the in-universe equivalent of the NSA and CIA) to spy on America’s public. With the eyes of a dead fish and the humanity of a slug, Norris is an obvious parody of Mark Zuckerberg, with some elements of Steve Jobs mixed in. The most disturbing part of the mission is the mission’s finale, where it is revealed how Michael sabotaged LifeInvader’s new phone prototype while infiltrating its offices. During Norris’s demonstration of the new phone, Michael calls the prototype, triggering the explosive he planted in the device for Lester and blowing Norris’s head off. Even Michael, the cold-hearted bank robber, is momentarily shocked. LifeInvader’s stock crashes after the assassination, and does not recover for the rest of the game. The Grand Theft Auto games are more than violence simulators; they also include biting satire of contemporary trends and public figures. Any number of fictionalized celebrities may appear in Grand Theft Auto VI, such as an HD variant of Donald Love as President of the United States; an electric car-touting mogul named Esau Stank with sixty-nine children; a podcaster named Andrew Lyle being brought up on Transylvanian-related underage sex charges who’s fled to the state of Leonida; or any number of celebrities.

2025-12-10T14:00:00,Pokémon Legends Z-A’s Real-Time Combat Is a Breath of Fresh Air,"Ever since its first games, one staple of the mainline Pokémon series has been its turn-based combat. Giving commands to the Pokémon from our team that was currently out in the field is a strategic task, and defeating adversaries depends at the very least on understanding weaknesses and core advantages of each move, especially when playing against other players. Pokémon Legends Z-A, however, introduces real-time combat to the mix, fundamentally transforming many of the mechanics. While other spin-offs, such as the Pokémon Rumble line, sometimes offered a more action-oriented experience, they were very different approaches with many fewer elements to factor in. As such, there’s a significant novelty to what Z-A adds to the pile. Moving in Real Time Screenshot from Nintendo Switch. Source: Author. Just as has been a staple of the main series so far, players can have a team of six Pokémon, each with four moves at most. In battle, only one of them is controlled at a time, giving players direct control over moves with a simple press of the button, as each move is linked to the corresponding position on the Joy-Con (A/B/X/Y). Drawing from some of the design choices of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, players control their avatar directly, and their partner works in tandem with them on the field. When facing wild Pokémon, they may attack the player directly, making it important to dodge out of harm’s way and be cognizant of your surroundings at all times. Though battling against the Pokémon that are owned by other humans is safer, your position matters, as it will impact your partner. The Pokémon follows the player around while no orders are given; this can be used to have some control over their positioning. It’s also possible to switch them with another or bring them back to the Pokéball and use this as a way to avoid a powerful move that could otherwise kill them. To attack, players must hold the ZL button to focus on a target first. Especially when facing groups of wild Pokémon, this lock-in mechanic becomes very important. When not using it, the player can use the items in their inventory, like Potions, to restore HP. Pokémon can also hold items, which wasn’t an option in Legends: Arceus. The Impact of the Cool Down System Screenshot from Nintendo Switch. Source: Author. Adapting the combat format to real-time actions also necessitated reformulating various aspects to make it work better. One such example is the limitations on using moves, which went from a point system to a cool-down timer. While the traditional games in the series present each move as having a limited pool of PP to use, Z-A makes it so that the Pokémon needs to recharge before using a move again. This change affects moves in two very distinct ways: they are now infinite and impossible to abuse continuously. Players don’t have to worry about spending all their uses anymore, as there’s no more “PP” to limit them, but the cool-down factor helps keep the experience balanced, as players can’t just hit the same move over and over until the enemy is gone. The enemy will likely have a move to make in between recharging, so players have to consider carefully what to do. This wait also helped give extra value to moves that aren’t focused on damage. When facing an enemy that has one specific dangerous attack, using Protect or Double Team at the right time can keep the player safe from harm for enough time to punish the enemy with attacks. Some well-known moves, like the aforementioned Double Team, now have different effects, taking into account what could be more useful in the real-time format. Especially for players who have mostly focused on having their Pokémon learn only damaging moves, the cooldown system makes it so that the player has more reasons to plan out the variety of the pool instead of just using the same move against the same Pokémon each turn. As a result, even basic stat-decreasing moves like Leer become more relevant, as it’s faster to use it than to strike twice with the same attack. Range and Status Conditions Screenshot from Nintendo Switch. Source: Author. Another aspect that changed significantly is the importance of the range of your attacks. Some moves depend on approaching the enemy before striking, while others can be done from afar. The scenery can also obstruct these attacks, either through objects working as literal walls or because differences in height make it hard to go after an enemy (like a Pokémon that’s flying away). Personally, I found long-range moves to be a little convoluted to pull. Instead of simply attacking from where they are (unless they were out of range), the Pokémon have to move to a spot closer to the player. This movement takes into account the player’s current position, but it can take a while to get used to it when using close-range attacks as well. Most status conditions have changed as well, with Sleep being changed to Drowsy and Confusion making behavior erratic rather than being a cause for occasional self-harm. Poison and Burn still work as usual by causing damage to the Pokémon over time, but a Paralyzed, Drowsy, or Frozen Pokémon will have their movement and attack speed affected, each in different ways. A Breath of Fresh Air Screenshot from Nintendo Switch. Source: Author. All of these changes are relevant ways that the game adapts itself to a new real-time format. Not only are they a matter of balancing, but they also help create a consistent system that’s a breath of fresh air for the series. While I’m very fond of the turn-based games and hope to see what the series brings to the table for them in the future as well, Pokémon Legends Z-A shows how much Game Freak can bring to the table when they have the chance to experiment with the format, and the series is in a much better place for having it.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.558531,Ivanir Ignacchitti,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/pokemon-legends-z-as-real-time-combat-is-a-breath-of-fresh-air/,9f76073161d98755e12b45b3a8c36382cecd6eee,1021,en,0.1,"Ever since its first games, one staple of the mainline Pokémon series has been its turn-based combat.

2025-12-08T14:00:26,And There Is No New Thing Under the Sun,"The villainess of Final Fantasy VIII wants to destroy time because the villain of Final Fantasy VIII is time itself. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. Ecclesiastes 1:9–11 What I mean by that is: Ultimecia, through some possessions during the past, is trying to transform Time, which is a line (or a lot of lines, a rhizome) into a dot, a point, because then all of the world’s suffering will end. The heroes of Final Fantasy VIII are controlled by destiny to stop her because destiny is nothing more than Time’s Holy Ghost. Its purpose is to make sure that everything will always fall into the right place. By her instrumentalized Logos, Ultimecia understands that time is what makes people suffer, because all idiosyncrasies are scrutinized through contrast and comparisons, and all pain is little more than immediate. Her people were persecuted, and at the same time, fate itself led her to become a villainess who would try to destroy time and would be stopped by a military group that only exists to stop her. This military group finds out that they have already known each other forever. Being just pawns of fate, playthings, metaphysical jokes, they were destined to strengthen lines that were previously decided as places from which they would hang, hold, but never let go. Transforming this line into a point, where everyone has access to every point in time simultaneously, each person can choose whichever moments they would live, in the order they want, passing through everything that was pre-established, but not in a linear fashion. Ultimecia doesn’t want to destroy destiny; she wants to destroy time to control destiny , a very congruent objective, because her own existence is not denied, just unfairly treated. To deny the denial of existence, you need to deny existence itself — and only then can true freedom be reached again. Final Fantasy VIII Remastered. Source: Author. The issue is that a ball of yarn is still composed of lines. Things had to happen until time compression existed. Something needs to occur within time so time can be destroyed (or affirmed). Determinism is kind of like a cuck, but it’s also conformed and comfortable in all of its victories, accepting things good and bad as only Real. It wants us, the inhabitants of its thread, to reach the same “clarity”: accept that things exist instead of lamenting decisions taken, mistakes made, or even celebrating when things work. Time is stoic in a teenager's way. It also doesn’t have a choice; therefore, nobody should have one. Time marches on regardless of us. We, however, are too creative to avoid suffering. We imagine other times, where yeses are nos, and nos are yeses, maybes are yeses or nos. We imagine that the mistakes we made apart from our words wouldn’t have happened, and we wish the mistakes others made had bigger consequences. We imagine that endings would have continued, that new beginnings would be derivative from old ones, that wills would be denied, wishes would be controlled, and censurings would be indulged. The point of all that imagining is that we don’t, won’t, didn’t have any answers. We know that for every question asked, we don’t just choose an answer — we choose to not choose every other answer. Time, in a way, allows infinity in its restriction: if it were freely accessible, it would be only reducible in the most varied ways. It is what it is, and what it was, and possibly what it will be too. Final Fantasy VIII Remastered. Source: Author. To play a video game is to time-travel. We go back in time when we mess things up. We talk to time travelers from the future, people who have already gone through our ordeals, whenever we search for things on the internet. We relive times we liked whenever we replay something, and we deny times we dislike, banishing them to the void whenever we abandon a game. All characters from all games are victims of our control; we are Time to them, and their programming is their fate. Final Fantasy VIII is a game that wants to Exist, and therefore uses its own determinism to destroy what makes it a game. Beating Ultimecia frees her from the shackles of fate. Now she can be whatever she wants; she has fulfilled her destiny, and her reward is liberty. She’s not a being chained to an attack cycle that can be easily negated by 99 Meltdowns in our menu. She can become something. Her destined cycle will be repeated every time someone plays the game until the end, and every time she will be freed to turn into whatever she wants. Meanwhile, all of the other characters will remain there in a perpetual interaction cycle amongst themselves, going to the same party while the credits roll, eating the same hot-dog, repeating the same dance, and looking out of the same window. Death gives Ultimecia her victory, and her liberation from fate by people who are just following theirs. It's the ultimate objective that she designed, beating time, controlling destiny, and controlling us, as well, since we are the beings who instrumentalize the characters to complete their tasks. Final Fantasy VIII was not the first to explore the idea of a Digital Nirvana (it’s something explored through the minds of any person who left their legacy digitally) but Ultimecia is maybe the first character to beat the suffering of being a prisoner to the cycle of lies that we call a narrative.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.560515,Guilherme Alves,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/and-there-is-no-new-thing-under-the-sun/,d052fa5f0df0316f937c9f5ca8ecb57255ebb23f,1022,en,0.1,"The villainess of Final Fantasy VIII wants to destroy time because the villain of Final Fantasy VIII is time itself.

2025-12-06T14:00:41,Indie Monthly: November 2025,"So another year draws to a close. Once again, Steam has set a record - with a month to go, VG Insights is showing slightly more releases than in 2024. Depending on how you categorize everything, we're going to see close to 20,000 releases this year, and I've only been able to show off the tiniest fraction of that. Even so, we've learned a lot about the world of indie games in 2025. Doing the research for this year's State of Indie was particularly enlightening, and if you haven't read that one yet, it's here and here . The short version, though? This year was promising, brutal, surprising, unfair, inspirational, and wide open - the same as it is just about every year. In any case, please enjoy my last four reviews for the year, as I will be taking December off. I could use the break. Source: Author. HANGRY HANGRY is a sci-fi ARPG with a focus on crafting. It's an action-heavy, story-light game that's all about eating, cooking, and evolving. Hangry is a hunter in a region of space where fine cuisine is the center of everything. Restaurateurs and food processors are the power brokers, and a rare cut of meat is the most valuable thing there is. Hangry would be the best at what he does, were it not for his habit of nibbling on the product. With the help of his boss Goutra, a chef and underworld caterer, he'll have to navigate the gastronomical politics of his world - and maybe come out stronger on the other side. The gameplay loop of HANGRY centers on visiting various planets, tracking rare animals, and taking them down while dealing with robotic game wardens. The combat is fairly standard for action RPGs - using combos of light and heavy attacks plus specials - but HANGRY also has a focus on stuns. Each enemy has a Poise meter that is depleted by rapid, precise attacks and the enemy is knocked senseless if their Poise falls below a certain threshold. Beyond its obvious tactical advantage, stunning an enemy gives the player a choice as to how to finish it off, with different finishers providing either short- or long-term benefits. A ravenous finisher - in which the protagonist partially devours the target - gives a large amount of experience, but destroys the meat and can ruin a quest if done recklessly. By contrast, a clean finisher yields a large number of ingredients that can be used in cooking later. The cooking minigame is a significant part of HANGRY. It's done at the end of mainline quests, but players are also free to cook for their own benefit using either found recipes or experimentation. Well-made dishes give experience, but can also grant permanent stat bonuses, making them key for more powerful builds. Overall, HANGRY is a solid choice for action fans, offering a satisfying combat system and lots of opportunities to develop a character. HANGRY is available for PC via Steam.

Taking on the role of a pizza delivery girl only known as ""B,"" the player has a very mundane task: deliver a pizza. There's nothing mundane about the delivery route, though. B's world is a bizarre, dreamlike place, one that's almost devoid of life. The only instructions come from a disembodied voice at the other end of a series of pay phones. It's a mystery as to who would have a pizza delivered across such a strange land, but the few people B encounters suggest that pizza might be more than mere food here. A Pizza Delivery leads the player across a series of surreal, often melancholic locations, each of which has a puzzle or two, and most have one lost soul eager for a chat. The puzzles and challenges are mostly intuitive, and there's little that will stop a dedicated player from finishing the story. Beyond the main plot, A Pizza Delivery truly revels in environmental storytelling, with lots of odds and ends pointing at events happening behind the scenes. The core story explores a few themes. The copy suggests that the story is about human connections, but a bigger element might be time. Most of the characters appear to be stuck in a timeless space, unable to process the past or find a new future. Memories are a key part of this, with some discussion about whether memory is a positive force or something that holds people back from moving on. Overall, A Pizza Delivery is a typical narrative adventure with some really nice visual imagery, and it should appeal to anyone who's into more surreal and symbolic storytelling. A Pizza Delivery is available for PC via Steam. A copy was provided for this review. Source: Author. Dark Quest 4 is a party-based TRPG dungeon crawler with some minor simulation elements. It features a distinctly old-school vibe that's bound to appeal to fans of tabletop and older PC RPGs. Dark Quest 4 is, both mechanically and aesthetically, modeled after a kick-in-the-door tabletop game. There is a minimal storyline, only enough to guide the player through a series of dungeon encounters. The player selects a party of three adventurers from a total of ten, eight available from the start, with two more in need of rescuing. For each section of the dungeon, the objective is to reach an end goal while collecting money for upgrades. Both combat and exploration are straightforward. The player advances through the dungeon one turn at a time, with the party members moving and acting independently. Once a member sights an enemy, the game shifts into combat mode. Each character on either side gets one action per round, with the order dictated by an initiative roll. All characters, be they PCs or NPCs, have a basic melee or ranged attack and (usually) one or more special abilities that can be used once per fight. Dark Quest 4 also features some light simulation elements. As much as you might want to pick one party and build the members into powerhouses, that's not really an option. Party members return from the dungeon beaten and exhausted, lowering their hit points until they've had a chance to rest. Between the low starting HP totals and minimal healing, tackling a dungeon at less than full health is not recommended, and a smart player will need to rotate party members to keep them all in fighting shape. It's probably not wise to put too much focus on individual party members anyway. The player can use looted money to buy skills and equipment for the PCs, but this isn't the kind of game where one can grind their way to success. End-game characters will be stronger than they were at the start, but not enormously so, and victory is more about strategy and risk management than raw numbers. Overall, Dark Quest 4 is a respectable choice for fans of old-school tabletop, but it won't have as much appeal to those who prefer more complex modern RPGs. Dark Quest 4 is available for PC via Steam, for PlayStation , Xbox, and Nintendo Switch . A copy was provided for this review. Source: Author. Berserk B.I.T.S Berserk B.I.T.S is an idler in the vein of Rusty's Retirement, meaning that it doesn't obscure the entire screen. It's a game designed very much with Mega Man fans in mind. As with other games in this category, Berserk B.I.T.S runs in a frame (or in this case, a series of frames) along the bottom of the screen, leaving the top two-thirds unobstructed. There is a range of options that allow the game to float on top of other windows, adjust the size relative to the screen, and move or hide individual frames. The game itself is an autoplaying RPG modeled heavily on the Mega Man Battle Network series. The player drops the BIT - the main character - in one of several areas in the explorer frame, where the character will fight through a dungeon with minimal to no direct input. A second frame houses the simulation element. The player can keep a certain number of supporting characters, including robots that periodically yield resources and programs that, as long as they are fed and cared for, allow the BIT to perform special attacks. Berserk B.I.T.S is more hands-on than other games in its genre. Most functions can be automated, and the game can eventually be fully idled, but it will take slightly longer to reach that point. And while the BIT will use special abilities as they are saved up, some difficult fights may require the player to manually choose skills to optimize their effectiveness. Unusually for these types of games, Berserk B.I.T.S does have a story. It isn't immediately apparent, but plot elements will begin to creep into the gameplay starting around an hour or two in. This is another element that calls upon a bit more attention than similar idle games. Overall, Berserk B.I.T.S is best for anyone who likes idlers, but wants a little more involvement in the action. Berserk B.I.T.S is available for PC via Steam. A copy was provided for this review. And with that, Indie Monthly is done for 2025!

2025-12-02T14:00:52,Rebuilding the Past in Winter Burrow,"With the cold part of the year quickly closing in and the holidays coming up, there's really no better time, in my opinion, to curl up with a cozy game and get lost in a world that's a lot smaller than yours. In Winter Burrow, the latest release from Pine Creek Games, this idea is pretty literal - it's hard to get much smaller than a mouse's world. Hope, Hardships, and the Meaning of Home In Winter Burrow, you play as a plucky little mouse who moves back to their childhood woodland home after the passing of their parents in the big city. They return to find the place worn down and slightly dilapidated, having been left in the care of an aunt who has had some difficulty maintaining it with her age and the harsh winter conditions. It's now your job to rebuild your home and protect the only family you have left. In the process, you meet your neighbors and help them resolve their own issues. The various animals of the woodlands have problems they can't solve alone - missing friends and family, misplaced resources, dangerous predators, and more become the focus of your interactions. Each character must learn to trust and confide in you to gain your help, and give you something in return; you all grow stronger and safer together. This game is delightfully precious. It had me tearing up in the intro; though we never get a name for our little mouse, I wanted to protect them immediately. The game's story explores the ideas of grief and hardship, but also love and community during difficult times. It's an exploration of interdependence and support, where even the harshest worlds can't keep you isolated or underfoot forever. I feel like that kind of hopeful commentary is especially poignant at the moment, and I'm happy to see the game tackling these concepts with sensitivity and kindness. Via Pine Creek Games. A Nostalgic Art Style What really drew me to this game in the first place was its aesthetic. Winter Burrow has a cartoon style that looks like a hand-drawn movie from the early '90s. My first thoughts were of The Secret of Nimh, An American Tail, and The Rescuers - the woodlands portrayed here could easily be a part of any of those stories. There's a bit more realism, though, that I deeply appreciate. The world feels grounded, fantastical, but following a sort of logic that mimics our world. I absolutely adore all of the deep, woodsy scenery (especially the reflective puddles! What a nice touch.) The character designs are equally wonderful, reminding me of series like Redwall and Watership Down. The animals look more realistic, but still wear adorable Victorian-English-style clothes. They fit so well into their little burrows and camps, looking quaint and charming while keeping some of the darkness that seeps from the background of the game's story. I especially love Bufo the Frog with their button-up dress at a mason's table. The music that accompanies your adventure is subtle, orchestral, and adventurous without taking over the scenes or taking you out of the semi-isolated experience. My favorite track is the one that plays as soon as you leave The Burrow; it feels foreboding, perfect for braving the wilds to rebuild and reclaim your home. Via Pine Creek Games. Interesting Mechanics and Gameplay Winter Burrow's mechanics are pretty standard fare for a survival game, with a few interesting additions that caught my attention in the trailers and have become some of my favorite aspects of play. The gameplay loop reminds me of Don't Starve. You have four attribute bars to manage: Health, Hunger, Warmth, and Breath. The first three are standard fare. Being attacked by a bug (the antagonists in the setting) will lower your health, but sleeping will renew it. Your hunger goes down naturally over time, but you can forage and cook food to refill it. Your warmth goes down over time when you're outside, especially at night, but can be refilled at any fire or in your home, and heat loss can be slowed by upgrading your clothing or eating certain foods. I found the addition of Breath interesting; it's a measure of exertion that, if it runs out, limits your ability to interact. For example, chopping wood or picking stone will deplete the bar, and once it's empty, your character pants and will not continue the action until it refills. Though the refill is quite fast, taking only a few seconds, it can be inconvenient if it happens mid-combat! I thought it was a clever way to remind the player that exerting energy in a freezing environment is a challenge, and you need to be clever with your action economy. I also love that the main mechanics of the game include knitting; I get to spin yarn and knit cute little outfits to keep my mouse warm! It's great! Their little needles are so cute in the menu animation. Aside from knitting, you can also cook a variety of sweet and savory treats and brew up teas for your mouse to enjoy, all made from the meats, berries, and nuts that you forage. The crafting system is simple and straightforward, with organized menus of raw materials and tools, furniture sorted by type, and various other extras that help you on your journey. I do have two small gripes about the mechanics. First, there is currently no map of the forest for you to reference, which can make quest completion difficult and often means you get a bit lost if you stray too far. This can be dangerous if you're not carrying a campfire kit, kindling, or food. There are plans to implement a map according to the development notes on Steam, so I have no worries about this as a long-term issue. Secondly, there is no way to sort your inventory, either on your person or at the Burrow. This is a bit frustrating and can make finding the materials you need or checking to see how much of certain things you have tedious and frustrating. Yet again, though, there is an inventory management system in the works, so I am content to be frustrated a little longer. Other than that, I deeply enjoy the loop of the game. It's satisfying to play for long stretches; you always feel like you have something to do without your list of quests feeling overwhelming. The open-world setup makes hopping between tasks easy and allows you to build your skills over time. If you get stuck on something, you can put it on the back burner until you have the experience or materials necessary to complete it without any consequences. I really appreciate the variety of characters and quests, and how they interact with each other to create a cohesive world. Via Pine Creek Games. Winter Burrow is Wonderful Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with Winter Burrow and the team at Pine Creek Games. They've managed to create something that soothes the cozy game itch perfectly, without feeling like it's just another farming sim slop piece in an extremely saturated genre. The unique and beautiful art and music, mixed with engaging NPCs and solid, simple mechanics, make for a relaxing, comforting experience that you're happy to dive into for hours at a time, fully immersing yourself in this lovely little world. I can't wait to see where Winter Burrow goes from here, and how the community - which is already growing - thrives as the game matures. I definitely believe that, in a too-fast, too-big real world full of over-our-heads problems, sometimes scaling it back to mouse-level can give us the clarity and comfort we need to make it through the darkest part of the year. While I was provided with a free press review key for Winter Burrow by the developers, my thoughts and opinions about the game are my own.

2025-11-30T14:00:34,The Stories Within Our Artifacts,"Being a collector can mean many things. Most associate physical media collecting with geeks surrounded by bookshelves of video games that will never get played. Others will hold five PlayStation games in their hands and feel just as much pride in their collection, however small it may be. We hold on to our discs and cartridges even today, as they hold the memories of our experiences. In some cases, an actual memory card holds the record of an actual beautiful memory associated with the game. Whether it's the game that had a best friend coming to your house every day over a blistering summer or the game that finally got your parent to enjoy your favorite hobby with you, only a physical copy will hold those memories. Displayed below are artifacts held dear by our SUPERJUMP writers, and the memories they contain. Nathan Kelly The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess on the Nintendo Wii. Source: Nathan Kelly. I present my copy of the Wii version of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. I remember my first experience with this game. I was at the house of one of my mom's friends as a kid, and I didn’t have too many people to hang out with at the time. I was just eating some party snacks or something, and upon entering the living room, they had a copy of Twilight Princess just sitting on their Wii. Immediately, I was sold by the foil art cover. Being a PlayStation kid, I had no idea what The Legend of Zelda even was at the time, but I had only ever seen two other boxes that looked nearly as good as this one: Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 2, my favorite games ever at the time. My family had a Wii that they had bought, hoping that it would get the kids up and moving (still a highlight of that console and something that the Switch has mostly left behind). I went to my dad and practically begged him for a copy of Twilight Princess, which he insisted that I would have to pay for myself. I used a collection of roughly 1,200 US nickels that a grandparent had given me at the time. I felt bad about this trade for a number of years. But as I grew older, I never gained an appreciation for coin collecting, so the only regret I still have over this is paying back my dad in a rather annoying currency. I was so excited to actually have the game in my hands as I eagerly popped it into my Wii. I played through the opening village and admittedly ran into a problem. Like many others at the time, I was too confused by the opening village area to actually trigger the events to go on the rest of the adventure. In my defense, you have to get a cat to follow you by fishing and then get it to chase you around; It was cryptic for a child. I put it down for a while, but eventually my dad came to me and mentioned how we went through such a hassle trading nickels for a game that I didn’t even play. This got me to actually sit down and play through the rest of the game, and I’m glad I did. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the greatest Nintendo action RPG I’ve ever played, and I doubt that I’ll ever trade it away. Mike Wilson Dream On Volume 18 on the Sega Dreamcast. Source: Mike Wilson. It can be incredibly challenging to name your favorite game when someone asks you to do so. In theory, this is something that could always be changing. If you’re a massive fan of the Zelda franchise, you know there will always be the next one coming, and it has a chance of supplanting your past favourite. But when someone asks about your most important game ever, well, that’s something else. We’re talking not just preferences, but something more meaningful and tangible, something that is part of your gaming history. Historically, I’m a Nintendo nerd. Raised on Hylian princesses, Italian plumbers, and Kongs called Donkey, I had an incredible upbringing in the gaming world. So it’s a huge surprise, even to me, that perhaps my most important game is, in fact, Virtua Tennis on the Dreamcast. I was Nintendo through and through. I always got to play on my friend’s Mega Drive, but at no point did I ever consider it superior to my SNES. Then SEGA threw a curveball and released the futuristic (for its time) Dreamcast. Incredible 3D graphics, amazing CD-quality sound, access to the internet, and still my favourite little thing, the VMU. Being the underfunded young man I was when I bought the Dreamcast, I wasn’t able to pick up many games. I obviously had to buy the Blue Blur in his first mainline 3D outing in Sonic Adventure, but outside of that, I didn’t have anything else. Virtua Tennis. Source: Moby Games. Thankfully, there was the Official Dreamcast Magazine (ODM) here in the UK, and for the first time as a gamer, I was able to play demo discs. As an owner of the N64, I was always jealous of other console users with their demo discs from magazines, and now here I was, doing it myself; incredibly exciting times for this Nintendo fanboy. ODM issue 17 gave us Dream On Volume 18, consisting of two videos of upcoming games and four demos for me to enjoy: Sega Extreme Sports, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX, Ducati World, and, most bizarrely, my most important game, a demo of Virtua Tennis. As with a lot of SEGA games at the time, it was a port of their arcade version from 1999, but it now allowed multiplayer madness in the home. I didn’t have a clue about this or the arcade version at the time, and I didn’t care; I was just excited to play something new that wasn’t Sonic. And play I did; I enjoyed choosing one of the then-famous players and seeing who I felt was more accommodating to my play style. I enjoyed playing a best-of-three sets with the computer, and I absolutely loved playing with and dominating my friends. Just to prove how incredible the VMU was, as you played the game, there would be a little matchstick equivalent of the game happening on the screen of the VMU. Who needed a massive TV with incredible graphics when you have a tiny pocket-sized one that does the same damned thing? Virtua Tennis. Source: Moby Games. This demo of Virtua Tennis was exciting, fluid, and just simply fun. It wasn't overly complicated and was so easy to just jump right into, even if you were a novice. This game kept me engaged with the Dreamcast; it kept the system alive while I saved up for an actual new game or waited for something for my birthday. It seems bizarre that this bite-sized demo, of all things, I consider to be my most important game, but I see it as something that truly opened up my gaming mind to things outside of just Nintendo. It taught me that even the simplest of things can be engaging and provide hours of smile-producing fun. To this day, I always make sure to get the latest system from each company so that I can play all games from across all the systems. Although Nintendo had my heart from the early days, SEGA stole it from them right at the end. Eventually, I was able to get Shenmue, and my word, did this really make the Dreamcast my most beloved console of all time. But whereas Shenmue made me fall in love with the Dreamcast, it was this small demo of Virtua Tennis that made me fall in love with gaming beyond Nintendo.

I was declared a traitor by my brother and cousins when I bought myself a PlayStation back in the early 2000s. We were a Nintendo family; how dare I turncoat for a competing console?! It wasn’t a desire to forsake Nintendo that drove me towards buying a PS1, for I would always love them. It was a desire to have something of my own . The Super Nintendo and N64 belonged to my older brother, and he would regularly exercise his dictatorship over their use. Being seven years younger, I could do little to stop him. I eventually saved up enough money from my paper route and made the leap. I bought a PS1, Crash Bandicoot, and Final Fantasy 7. I had never experienced a game like FF7 before, so ripe with deep narrative and heavy themes, somewhat beyond what my eleven-year-old brain could fully comprehend. There was a story here far beyond saving the princess/realm/universe, complete with characters whom I bonded with over dozens of hours. It felt like I had discovered a vital element that I was missing before. I needed more! I immediately became hooked on RPGs, especially Final Fantasy. I devoured FF8, then FF9. When I saw Final Fantasy Tactics in the store one day, I bought it without a second thought. Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. Source: Square Enix. And once again, a veil was lifted from my adolescent brain, revealing to me an incredibly detailed medieval fantasy world of political intrigue, class warfare, treachery, and sacrifice. Characters had their naivety laid bare, their values challenged and demonstrated through combat. Systems of government and economics were exposed and torn apart through sharp rhetoric. Again, I could not grasp the full depth of its arguments, but it felt profound even then, as if the lessons buried within were relevant to life and I could hopefully decode them someday. All of this was built upon the most foreign game design I had ever encountered. Every game I had picked up until then felt intuitive, even if I blasted through tutorials. With youthful hubris, I reckoned myself smart enough to figure this game out quickly. Boy, was I WRONG. Why were my attacks missing so often?!! Why couldn’t I move my character as far on this grid as the enemy could? Did that guy just destroy my armor? What the heck!!! I gave the protagonist the same birthday as me, but why in the world did that matter? I shelved FFT for a few months, frustrated after being confronted with my own naivety and defeated so soundly in Dorter Trade City time after time. But it had a hold on me, pulling at me to give it another shot. So I resolved to take the time to learn. Thus, a lifelong love of this game was born, and I learned a lesson about my own capacity. I hadn’t realized that a game could teach me more about myself. Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. Source: Square Enix. I got my best friend to try it out, and he enjoyed it just the same. In future sleepovers, I would bring my PS1 over and we would play FFT literally all night, trading the controller in 3-hour shifts. The person not playing would either catch up on sleep or help the other as a consulting tactician. I would go back to play FFT every few years and found that each time the story and its themes hit me in a new way. Even today, as I’m playing through the recently released Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, I’m taking screenshots of lines of dialogue that feel FAR too relevant to today’s political atmosphere and class inequality. When I think back, attempting to pinpoint what games were pivotal in stoking my love of storytelling and desire to write, FFT is chief among them. FF7 may have opened my eyes, but FFT opened my mind and continues to do so today. Young PJ would be happy to know that I finally understand everything that this wonderful game offers and all that it has given me. Jahanzeb Khan More than any of the latest, increasingly expensive gaming tech, Atari has been responsible for rekindling my love for video games and their rich history. The launch of the + Platform really opened the door for both lapsed gamers and newcomers to connect with Atari's history. Both the 2600+ and the 7800+ consoles are designed to play nearly all cartridges right out of the box. Not only the old cartridges that are out in the wild, but even modern homebrew releases from publishers like Atari Age. Atari themselves have even been commissioning and publishing new releases, not just reprinting their legacy software but even brand new ports, such as the recent 7800 port of Tiger-Heli. HERO on the Atari 2600. Photo by Jahanzeb Khan. For me, the + Platform really opened up a whole new world of gaming and game collecting, and being able to play these ancient cartridges on hardware that connects with ease is just one of the coolest gaming alternatives. One of my favourite things to do is to go out and hunt for Atari cartridges, and I've done this every chance I can get when exploring Melbourne or visiting any city in Australia. I'm often amazed to find some really good hauls in the most unlikely spots, and more often than not, I can get them at a pretty good price. If you're going to a retro game shop, chances are that the business owner will know what the games are worth, and so you want to head into pawn shops and thrift stores that are not gaming-specialised, where you are likely to find a random haul of old games that they'd rather get rid of quickly. Oh, and you can always count on your local Rotary Club op shop to give you the best possible deal on games! In my many hunting adventures, I've stumbled upon some really rare Atari games, especially when it comes to the North American releases that were released much later in the lifecycle of the original 2600 VCS console. One of my favourites is this copy of HERO, an adventure platformer that was truly ahead of its time. It was like Metroid before Metroid was even a thing. I was on a trip to Sydney and about to board the train to the airport to catch my return flight, when I suddenly had this weird hunch to check out a random pawn shop in Chinatown. I'm glad I listened to my sixth sense because the secondhand jewelry shop had a random assortment of cartridges tucked away in a corner. I think the owner was surprised that I was interested in buying these, and so I paid nearly nothing for them. My haul from there included the aforementioned HERO and lesser-known 2600 ports of Rampage and Double Dragon. HERO in particular is quite expensive and hard to find in Australia, and so it's the thrill of discovering these hidden gems in the wild (at a great price!) that makes Atari game hunting one of my favourite travel pastimes.

2025-11-28T14:00:33,Now Playing at SUPERJUMP: Issue 36,"We're back with a brand new Now Playing. Our team is playing a bit of everything this month, which isn't a surprise with our diverse roster of contributors who jump in each month. We have the latest FPS, celebrated indies, roguelikes, and AAA masterpieces. No matter what we're playing, we want to share with you and maybe send you down the path to try something new. Let us know in the comments what you're playing and what news has you excited for the future! Charlotte Huston Battlefield 6 I found myself rather intrigued by the prospects a new Battlefield game would potentially have to offer. I’ve always had a love for the FPS genre, and we haven’t really seen the genre’s flagship IPs shine in recent years the way they did in the late 2000s or early 2010s. Those who aren’t familiar with the FPS genre are likely confused about why Battlefield has captivated so many in its launch. It’s been a long time coming for a franchise such as Battlefield to return to glory, to deliver an experience that players truly want. I was hoping Battlefield 2042 could’ve been that game, but it unfortunately had its own fair share of issues while also losing the plot on what makes the Battlefield IP so lovable. Perhaps it sounds simpler than it actually is, but that stellar sandbox-y immersive gameplay fans want from Battlefield does not cater to taking notes from Call of Duty’s Operator format in the way 2042 attempted. Battlefield 6. Source: Steam. As much as the two franchises get compared, any FPS fan will tell you that the two games play quite differently. Whereas Call of Duty is known for very fast-paced arcadey gameplay, Battlefield prides itself on playing objectives alongside team cohesion. Now was the right time for Battlefield. This moment in time is the perfect instance for Battlefield to truly nail what their fans want, and they were successful in doing that. Interest in Call of Duty has reached an all-time low, with the franchise cannibalizing its own identity with out-of-place collaborations. The average FPS fan does not want to see animated characters running around in their games. They want a game that invokes the feeling of being grounded in reality; the “mil-sim” experience, if you will. When a game like Battlefield 6 releases in a state where it provides exactly what FPS fans are starved for, you get a game that blows up the way this one does. It’s beautiful to see, and it’s an absolute blast to play. I’ve always been a casual fan of Battlefield, so you won’t get a nuanced breakdown of what’s different in the gameplay from me. The game is enjoyable, and that’s all that matters. It feels wonderful to have a Battlefield game we can consider great once again. We should be rooting for Battlefield and even Call of Duty to be great. Call of Duty is feeling clear pressure, as evidenced by the Black Ops 7 beta. Activision is finally giving in and rectifying long-standing fan complaints about the series. When there’s steep competition in a genre, we get better games out of it. The winners here are the consumers, who have higher-quality games that they can enjoy. It’s what we want from AAA shooters, and I’m very happy to see Battlefield doing well for that reason. I’d happily recommend giving it a shot if you are looking to hop back into one of these types of games. Dead Cells. Source: Author. B. Cantrell Dead Cells OK, I’ll admit it: I’m obsessed with Dead Cells. I’ve bought it on almost every platform I own. The only major frustration for me is the lack of cross progression. With a game this deep, progress ends up scattered across devices, and my hard-earned unlocks stay trapped where they were earned. Cross-platform saves would be a godsend. Of course, the smart move is to stick with one version for the long haul, and for me, that’s on the Switch. Because, you see, Dead Cells is very much a long-haul game. By sheer hours alone, it sits near the top of my library, and even after six years of playing it still finds new ways to surprise me. By far, the main thing keeping me hooked is the razor-sharp combat. This is pure action, with every slash, arrow shot, and firebomb feeling visceral. I just love the way busted-up baddies burst into smatterings of crunchy pixel-art confetti - it never gets old. Kills matter too, because enemies drop glowing orbs, which are the currency for permanent upgrades, so you’re incentivised to fight hard and clear every room (unless you're attempting a speed run, of course). Biomes are procedurally generated, and you choose different routes each time, so layouts, mobs, and secrets keep shifting. The roster of levels is huge, too, from toxic sewers and sunset ramparts to haunted shipwrecks and gloomy castles with vampires; there's always something new to see. Dead Cells. Source: Author. Have I gushed about the combat enough? No? Well, here's some more. Enemy encounters are fast and fluid, playing out like a Doom-esque dance of two-dimensional combat chess. You weave sword strikes, projectiles, and tossed grenades while dodging and sliding around hazards. On higher difficulties, it becomes a high-stakes ballet. When it clicks, it feels incredible. But when things fall apart, you usually know why, which makes heading back in for just 'one more run' an easy choice. The epic boss fights really seal the deal, too. Every few biomes, things build up to a frantic test of everything you’ve learned on the run so far. One mistake can end it all and send you back to the start, which makes endgame victories feel like glorious fist-pumping wins. Another aspect I love: beating the final boss is only the beginning. Boss Cells (rewarded after completing a successful run) let you raise the difficulty for bigger rewards. Each Boss Cell added throws down tougher enemies and new hazards, but also higher-tier loot. That moment I realised that finishing my first run was only a warm-up blew my mind. Years later, I’m still discovering new weapons and hidden rooms I’ve never seen. Dead Cells feels fantastic to play and offers depth and replayability in equal measure. For me, it's easily one of the best action roguelites ever made. Keeper. Source: Steam. CJ Wilson Keeper Keeper had my interest based on my experience playing many of Double Fine’s previous games, like Psychonauts, Costume Quest, and Stacking. It’s very much a narrative game with some straightforward puzzles to solve. The gameplay largely revolves around you controlling a sentient lighthouse while also moving a bird who opens doors or turns levers to progress to the next level. While there is no spoken dialogue, the game makes you care about the friendship between the lighthouse and the bird as they make their way towards a mountain. The visuals feature some gorgeous landscapes with psychedelic effects that make Keeper stand out from the games I normally play. As something you can play on Xbox Game Pass, I highly recommend you play it if a short, calming narrative experience interests you. Ryse: Son of Rome This is an underrated game that I have played several times now, but I just finished it yet again on my Series X on Legendary difficulty. It’s always fun to replay a game that you enjoyed before, and I just wanted to get more achievements after playing some newer releases this year. Dispatch I finished playing Dispatch earlier this week, and I was pleasantly surprised by the writing and gameplay. I laughed out loud many times as I went through each episode. I appreciated the management sim elements of choosing which hero would work best for a given scenario and seeing the synergies formed among the heroes you create. Certain emotional narrative moments will definitely stick with me for a long time, along with the tough choices I made along the way. I definitely would want to replay it to see what the other choices would look like and see if there are any meaningful changes within the story. Dispatch is certainly a game that I see being one of my favorites for this year. Hollow Knight: Silksong. Source: Steam. PJ Walerysiak Hollow Knight: Silksong Silksong delivers on every expectation I held in my heart and mind. The combat is far more varied and feels more difficult than its predecessor. Its hauntingly beautiful soundtrack enhances both story and environment. And speaking of the story, the narrative threads are woven more tightly throughout every location, every interaction, every item. Yet it doesn’t forcefully drill into your head with its storytelling. It all feels delicately connected yet reactive to your influence. You can see the web and touch the web, even change the web. In short, I’m consistently admiring Silksong’s narrative design; in a word, I’d describe it as thoughtful. I love how small interactions over time can develop the environment or NPCs, as well as a player’s fondness and understanding of them. It is remarkable how those relationships have the potential to be radically altered in a single moment. I particularly enjoy playing Hornet’s Needolin for every NPC after exhausting their standard dialogue. Each sings a unique song, with words they would not share otherwise. Their tune, their message, gives you an intimate glimpse into their culture and soul: Sometimes it’s funny, and sometimes it’s profoundly sad. Yet it is always an enriching and thoughtful coda from Team Cherry. The Outer Worlds 2. Source: Steam. Fallout: New Vegas & The Outer Worlds 2 I’ve been on an Obsidian kick lately. I’m lumping these two games together since I’m not particularly far in either at the moment. This has been a good year for Obsidian. Avowed is an excellent experience, and one I’ll miss since I cancelled my Game Pass subscription – though I’m eagerly waiting for a Steam sale. In the meantime, I decided to buy New Vegas on PC and play through it for the first time since 2010. Then I just couldn’t help myself and bought The Outer Worlds 2 as well. It’s great fun so far, making me consistently chuckle at its hilarious writing. It feels very cool to see that Obsidian has kept its core DNA active and alive over the decades. New Vegas encourages an immersive role-playing experience, constantly offering ways to utilize your chosen skill choices through gameplay mechanics or dialogue. It wants you to commit to a character choice, rather than being a Jack-of-all-trades. The Outer Worlds 2 follows suit, jamming every conversation with skill-related options and presenting various ways to utilize your abilities (as long as they’re leveled up appropriately). Both games wind up feeling very rewarding while simultaneously instilling in you a yearning to build an entirely different character next time. Between these two games, I feel spoiled. The writing in each is great. Their stories have me captivated and entertained. Both do a good job of signposting where you need to go to progress the story, but neither ever tells you how you should do it. You have the agency to choose, which is what a good immersive RPG is all about. Possessor(s). Source: Steam. Bryan Finck Ghost of Yotei My main gaming endeavour over the last month has been the fantastic sequel from Sony's first-party studio, Sucker Punch. I'm not quite done with it yet due to the fractured nature of my available playtime, but I'm guessing that the end is near. I've loved the fresh story, enhanced and expanded combat, and the multiple relationships that heroine Atsu develops with the various NPCs in and around Ezo. I think it might be padded out a bit too much, but I've rarely felt that any of the activities are dull or repetitive. The visuals are absolutely stunning, a true testament to the power of the PS5, and I'm constantly staring at the horizon and the incredible level of detail in every corner of the world. Make sure you don't miss this one! Possessor(s) I reviewed the new side-scrolling Metroidvania from developer Heart Machine Games over at Seasoned Gaming, and really enjoyed my time with it. Combat and traversal are quite enjoyable, with a wide variety of tools available to aid your destructive tendencies and keep things fresh even after many hours. There is ample reason to chase 100% completion, plumbing the world for all its secrets and goodies. The story made me want to keep playing, and there were plenty of late nights spent just wanting to see what was in the next area because the game simply looks fantastic.

2025-11-26T14:00:56,Thoughts on Silent Hill F,"Silent Hill F is not only the first brand new survival horror game in the franchise in a long time, but also the series' first spin-off, bringing the action to new locales and situations. We leave the horrors of America for a trip to 1960s Japan. While the game presents a fresh take on the series, its gameplay feels like it's being pulled between two horrors. Cursed All Over The story follows Hinako, a teenage girl in a rural mountain town. One day, a fog rolls in that seems to cause everyone to disappear, and the town is now full of strange monsters out to get her. She not only needs to navigate the town with the remaining survivors, but a strange man haunts her nightmares. The story is great, and the game avoids retreading the themes and plot of prior games in the series. Hinako is portrayed as a tomboy and someone who does not like that women are seen as nothing more than a traditional housewife to a man. This upsets her father, who views her as less than her older, married sister. The girls of the village treat her as an outsider and a freak because she doesn't act like the other girls, and because her best childhood friend is a boy. The impact of misogyny and how it can be inflicted by both men and women is on display here. While the story may be different, you're still going to wander around seemingly normal environments, getting into fights and puzzle-solving. Silent Hill F, however, does things a bit differently with both. Spooky Soulslike? The combat system here feels like an attempt to mirror the more personal and methodical fighting of a Soulslike. You'll pick up weapons from the environment in the everyday world, while the nightmare world has stock weapons. The everyday weapons have durability and can break after being overused, but tool kits can be found to enact repairs. Inventory management is a big deal, as you start with limited inventory slots and will want to fill them up with the various recovery items that heal or provide other bonuses. You can find inventory upgrades that are definitely worth seeking. Combat plays a far larger role here than in previous entries, which does distract from the exploration. Source: Author. Sanity is a new resource that works with the advanced techniques for fighting. You have a light and heavy attack, which both drain stamina on use. By holding down the focus button, you'll consume sanity to either charge for a strong attack or attempt to counter the enemy when they flash to perform a stunning blow. Sanity can also drain if you are hit by certain attacks, and running out means you take increased damage. You can sell certain items for ""faith"" at the local shrines/save points that can be used to upgrade your stats and equip Omamoris that provide passive boosts. The enemy design here is great despite the presence of just a few main types. Each one moves and behaves differently, with a lot of idle animations and weird posturing to make it hard to read them. These are not your basic mannequin monsters from the previous games, and that extends to the newly designed boss fights that are far more lively than previous ones. I'll talk about this further down, but the combat feels less about survival horror and more like a slower take on a Soulslike. Brain Scratching Scares For those fearing that a new Silent Hill wouldn't have fiendishly difficult puzzles, I can put those fears to rest. The puzzle design returns to the roots of the series and survival horror, as you must use knowledge both in and outside of the game if you want to solve them. I played on the highest puzzle difficulty, and it was certainly a challenge. Some of the puzzles require you to understand logic or information without giving you the reference points or material you need, which can lead to frustration. For the very first and last puzzles, I had to look up the solutions, and even knowing it, I had no idea how the clues were supposed to reference the answer. That represents a breakdown in puzzle design – if the clues still don't make sense after you solved it, then the puzzle and/or clues weren't good to begin with. It's like asking someone to solve a puzzle related to John and Jane's favorite colors, but the game never tells you who John and Jane are and expects you to know who the game developer's friends are as a reference. This feels like a return to the player-unfriendly puzzle design that dominated the adventure genre starting in the 80s. The one upside is that the puzzles come paired with an excellent journal system, not only keeping track of the characters and monsters, but also providing a collection of all found hints and their relation to each puzzle. This is something I would love to see standardized among adventure games. However, this does come at a cost; there are far fewer puzzles compared to previous entries, and a greater focus on combat, which takes me to my main issues with the game. While the game purports to be survival horror, there are a lot of action game and Soulslike design features, including unblockable grabs. Source: Author. All the Action and Survival Horror Combat has never been the focus of a Silent Hill game, and has functionally been a bit janky at best. This is the first game to have a fully built combat engine; however, ""combat engine"" and ""survival horror"" don't really work together. The aforementioned Soulslike style, on paper, seems like it would work for a survival horror game – Hinako has very long wind-up and recovery animations, so every attack has to be planned out. However, you also have a dodge with I-frames and a punish attack. The game is heavily focused on stunning enemies to deliver more damage, which heavy strikes, focus strikes, and your punish can achieve, and the game is really going to make you use them. This is by far the most combat-intensive Silent Hill game I've seen yet. The horror of being in a town beset by a curse starts to fade after your umpteenth fight as you rip apart your enemies. What I really didn't like from a horror standpoint is that the game wants you to avoid combat and gives you the option to sneak by enemies in spots...and then it locks you into arenas to fight your way out. At one point, the game practically gives you a devil trigger and asks you to rip and tear until it is done. Regarding enemy design, I understand the subtext of featuring an enemy that is about the horror of birth in a game about a girl struggling with misogyny. That said, having an enemy that can infinitely respawn other enemies, in a required arena, in a survival horror game, starts to get annoying, not scary. When you are in those high-action segments, you are still using the very slow, very stilted combat system. While you can upgrade your stamina and sanity, along with the help of the Omamoris, they don't suddenly make the combat faster or provide a new dynamic, such as the auto locks featured in the Callisto Protocol. Sometimes, the enemies just refuse to use any counter-able attack, and you'll need to rely on hopefully getting the stagger off, or you will be attacked easily. There are some Omamori that are really good, but they are tied to the random draw, proving the real psychological horror is gacha. The very fact that there are repeated arena fights in a Silent Hill game makes it tempting for me to give this game an F just on that alone. Even with different endings, you're still going to be hacking and slashing through the game's combat portions. Source: Author. Not So Final Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that all this was designed around playing the game a minimum of 3 times, with a total of 5 endings. This is the only horror game I could think of that actually adds new challenges and puzzles on repeated playthroughs of the main quest, but it's all built on the same annoying puzzle design and repetitive combat. I do like that the world is different, leading to more information and additional content, but you must go through the entire game again to begin seeing this. The best parts of this game are when you get to wander around looking for clues and investigating, and you can do far more of that on your second playthrough and beyond. Besides having upgraded stats to decrease the difficulty, just having more inventory space to hold and experiment with the additional items also makes things easier. An item I neglected on my first run that would have helped tremendously is the one that gives you infinite stamina for a few minutes. However, asking the player to repeat the majority of what they just did so that the story makes sense doesn't really work in my opinion. Either the game needs to feel like a different experience, such as Madhouse mode from Resident Evil 7, offer a brand new experience like the Route A/ Route B setup in Resident Evil 2, or just let the player tear through everything they've already done to get to the new stuff. A Loud Failure For me, Silent Hill F fails when it comes to puzzle and combat; as a survival or action horror game, it just doesn't work. I wonder if the developers saw the success of Resident Evil 7 and its successors, and felt that the solution to bring back Silent Hill was just to add more combat and action. The story and monster designs are great, but focusing so much on combat, even to the game's difficult final boss, feels like a bit of a betrayal of the series. It's hard to be introspective and learn more about yourself and society when you're busy dodging multi-hit combos from all sides while trying to find the punish tell. (Note: This review was written with the 1.0 version of Silent Hill F. Following the release, the game has had a balance patch that has reduced the difficulty and the amount of encounters, but I have not had a chance to replay it to see the exact changes).

2025-11-24T14:00:31,"WordPlayer: It Takes a War Is a Sad, Loving Ode to Your Friend List","It Takes A War - the new game from Thomas Mackinnon, developer of The Corridor - opens in a way that few single-player games do: by pretending to check your Internet connection and microphone before dropping you into the first round of a fake, Counter-Strike-inspired deathmatch game. As you run through the TDM_FILTH map, gunning down the enemy team with a small variety of generic weapons, the rest of your team is filled out with a squad of players who all clearly know each other and have a history of playing games together. You're the lone rando, and you're told your microphone privileges will only activate once you've played a match through to completion. In other words, you can't join in on the conversation, but you're going to have to listen to it. What feels like it's going to be a quick game soon turns into something else entirely: a seemingly never-ending, increasingly existential experience, one that you're going to have to ride out with these strangers. Source: Steam I'm going to do that annoying rhetorical thing where I admit that I have to really talk around It Takes A War somewhat in this article. I'm not going to say you should go into the game completely blind - I would like you to stick around to read this piece, after all. This isn't a game predicated on a massive twist so much as it does a bunch of fun and interesting stuff across its 45-odd minute runtime. I can say that the game gets weird in ways that I liked, that I'm comfortable recommending it to anyone who likes interesting narrative experiments, and leave it at that. What I can say, without spoiling any of that weirdness, is that It Takes A War is a single-player game about playing games with your friends. Perhaps more pointedly, it's about your friend list - that list of people on your system that you, ostensibly, could jump into a game with at any time. If you're anything like me, you've accumulated a lot of people on your friend lists across multiple consoles over the years. It could be that you have a dedicated group of people you play with often. Perhaps you'll go online one day and see an old friend playing the same game you wanted to jump in on, and you'll join their game, giving them a little thrill as they see (and perhaps shoot at) a familiar face. Maybe, like me, you really enjoy seeing what other people are playing, but don't often jump into games with them anymore. The story in It Takes A War is about a group of friends who play together, and a conflict that has arisen within the group. Is this friendship, which has become so built upon these games, an equal friendship? Does it extend beyond the game they're all playing together? The game - which is somewhere between a shooter, an art piece, and a very light horror experience - explores these questions with your teammates before turning the question right back on you. Source: Steam The way it represents that conflict is interesting, and I won't spoil it here; suffice to say that it tapped into something I was already feeling - a sort of melancholy for the increasingly quiet online spaces of my life, the ones I still pop my head in on without engaging as directly as I used to. I'm in my late 30s now, and it's been a long time since I last got seriously invested in an online team-based game. Back in the Xbox 360 days, I would play online with friends regularly, jumping in at various points throughout any given week to see what the folks on my friend list - a mix of real-life and online pals - were playing. We jumped between different games regularly, but tended to concentrate on shooters - lots of Call of Duty, lots of Halo, and a dabble in Gears of War.  The one that sticks out the most in my mind is Battlefield: Bad Company 2, a game that I would reliably play with these friends a few times a week over a period of at least several months - possibly as long as a year. Now and then, I'll look through my friend list on each system. On every list, there are people who have simply disappeared, both from my friend list and, by extension, my life. The Xbox friend list is the worst offender for what I think are probably obvious reasons, but all my other friend lists also contain people who simply stopped logging in one day. Many of them are people I met on gaming forums that no longer exist, or social media that I no longer post to, or through my work as a writer, where I've seen so many people exit. I see their names and remember that we were once people who played together, as younger adults. I think about the parts of my life that have changed since we played together, and I wonder about the ways their lives have changed, too. Screenshot taken by author Recently, I made my Steam activity private for work reasons I won't get into here. It means that whenever I log in and play a game - including It Takes A War - no one can see that I'm doing it, and to anyone who monitors their friend list and sees my name, it'll look like I have not played any games on Steam in a few months. To people whose only remaining connection to me was their Steam friend list, it might look like I'm disappearing, too. They can't see that I am playing this game and thinking about them. It Takes A War understands this melancholy. The shooter you're playing is pointedly out of date, the sort of game that you might have enjoyed with less irony 20-odd years ago over a crappy Internet connection - a throwback to a different time. It's the kind of game I more actively seek out now; a short, single-player, narrative-driven experience that gives me something to think about and then lets me move on. It's somewhat ironic that it has left me thinking about the past so much. To all the old friends who made those Xbox 360 shooters so fun to play online, and to all the folks on my PlayStation, Nintendo, and Steam lists who simply stopped logging in one day - hello, I hope you're still out there, and I hope you're well.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.577380,James O’Connor,SUPERJUMP,https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/wordplayer-it-takes-a-war-is-a-sad-loving-ode-to-your-friend-list/,a2c84839b1ead540ef6d22694996663871aaf85e,1029,en,0.1,"It Takes A War - the new game from Thomas Mackinnon, developer of The Corridor - opens in a way that few single-player games do: by pretending to check your Internet connection and",other,0.25

2025-09-25T21:32:58,Doug Bowser Retiring as Nintendo of America’s President and COO,"Nintendo of American just announced via press release that Doug Bowser will retire from his President and Chief Operating Officer on December 31, 2025. Bowser has worked for Nintendo since 2015, beginning as the Vice President of Sales. In 2016, he was promoted to Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Then in 2019, he moved into his current role, replacing Reggie Fils-Aimé. “One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong,” said Bowser. “Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers. Bowser will be succeeded by the current NOA Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing, and Consumer Experience, Devon Pritchard, who is “a 19-year veteran of the video game industry and a long-standing member of the NOA leadership team.” It is also worth noting that Prichard will become the first female NOA President following Minoru Arakawa, Tatsumi Kimishima, Fils-Aimé, and Bowser. “Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.” “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role,” said Pritchard. “Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.” In addition, NOA also announced that the current Managing Executive Officer at Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NCL) will continue in his role, but he will also be joining NOA as the new Chief Executive Officer. Further, they stated that “Pritchard will also join the NOA Board of Directors and become an NCL Executive Officer.” [Source: Press release from Nintendo of America]",2025-12-17T11:45:54.594740,Steve Cullum,NintendoFuse,https://nintendofuse.com/doug-bowser-retiring-as-nintendo-of-americas-president-and-coo/,ba31a3876d65f38dbf1442ee9ac727da17e8a3f7,1033,en,0.1,"Nintendo of American just announced via press release that Doug Bowser will retire from his President and Chief Operating Officer on December 31, 2025.

2025-06-06T14:34:45,REVIEW – Cabernet,"When you think of vampires, typically you might envision dark and menacing, bloodthirsty creatures living in some castle somewhere in the Carpathian Mountains, terrorizing the local villagers.  Or perhaps you think of a group of teenage vampires feeding on the eclectic folks in a coastal Californian town in the 80’s.  However, in Cabernet, you’ll find something completely different – a newly sired vampire, trained as a doctor in her previous life, caring for the residents of her town, all while having to balance her urges, with the need to feed. Cabernet takes place in a 19 th century Eastern European inspired world, in the form of a 2D narrative RPG.  Players will be tasked with guiding Liza, a young vampire struggling with her morality and the supernatural world she unwittingly was forced into. You are introduced to Liza in the most morbid of ways, at her funeral.  As you listen to her family members speak fondly of her, the dialogue will pause for you to choose which narrative options appeal most to you about her character.  These choices matter, as they impact Liza’s stats, of which, there are 4 – Music & Arts, Literature & Poetry, Science & Logic, and finally, History & Politics.  These stats directly impact the actions you can take during conversations with the townsfolk.  And these interactions are the “meat” of the game.  As a narrative RPG, you are tasked with a list of objectives, all of which require that you interact with the townsfolk.  As you progress through the story, you will uncover a hidden world of political intrigue, sinister secrets, class conflict, and corruption that spans both the living and the dead.  As the story progresses, you’ll also find out how you became a vampire and for what reason you were turned. As you begin the game, you’ll wake up locked in a dark, dank room somewhere deep underground.  After you escape, you’ll make your way up a few flights of stairs only to find yourself in a fancy ballroom of sorts.  This turns out to be the home of Countess Orlova, who has ruled your new home for 400 years.  The inhabitants of this home of both human and supernatural.  You will immediately find yourself speaking to all the inhabitants, eventually being introduced to your handler who helps you get accustomed to your powers.  Speaking of powers, you will be able to turn into a bat and fly around quickly, turn invisible to avoid detection, and hypnotize your fellow townsfolk to feed on their blood.  There is a simple morality system in place which balances between Humanity and Nihilism.  The choices you make will impact these two categories, and you will find that some narrative choices are locked behind either Humanity or Nihilism, so you need the number indicated in the conversation choice or higher to choose the desired action. Timing is critical, as you must make haste to the safe confines of your coffin before sunrise or else you will suffer death by painful fires.  I tried it once; I would not recommend it! Although, there is no permadeath, you just load at your last save point.  There is a helpful “clock” of sorts that indicates the time and how close you are to the sunrise.  Time moves at a consistent pace, except for when you choose certain actions, such as reading a book, which improves stats.  I found myself at times, reading books for all my actions before having to sleep for the day.  The process is quick enough though that it never gets too tedious.  Speaking of stats, each evening when you wake up, you are always in your nightclothes.  Before you can leave the room, you must choose an outfit from your wardrobe.  Certain outfits give stat bonuses when worn, so you must put thought into what you wear so that it benefits your conversations with the townsfolk. There are only a couple issues I should mention – I ran into a couple weird visual bugs, with a character model who had died (I failed the optional objective) and a model of his body was laying down in two different rooms at the same time.  This wasn’t a game breaking, but it was odd.  The only big complaint I have is with the menu UI.  This was clearly designed for a keyboard and mouse, so playing on the Nintendo Switch was frustrating on a consistent basis. Overall, I really enjoyed playing Cabernet, and uncovering the hidden plots, the story of Liza, and even getting to know the townsfolk. I would recommend taking a bite out of Cabernet.  It will satiate your appetite for a good narrative rpg, trust me.

2025-06-04T16:00:00,Interview with Stephan Berendsen on Boulder Dash’s 40th Anniversary,"Boulder Dash is celebrating 40 years and celebrating with an anniversary version of the game. I recently sat down with Stephan Berendsen, the CEO of BBG Entertainment, to talk about this classic, its lasting history, and what they are planning for the future. What’s it feel like to work on such a classic series to celebrate 40 years? Boulder Dash has always been one of the most important video games for me. I played it as kid for hours and days on my old home computer. And when I was asked in 2017 by the rights holder, who wanted to retire, if I would like to take over this brand and develop it further, I jumped at the chance – Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary is what I always imagined it to be. The classic content and brand new, contemporary content on all relevant platforms. We always want to take Boulder Dash further and create a game for both the old Boulder Dash fans and the new young generation What new things did you want to bring to the series to leave your mark? We pursued two goals: Firstly, we wanted to bring the first three parts Boulder Dash I , II and III to life as faithfully as possible on current machines. Secondly, we wanted to spice up the classic gameplay with contemporary visuals and suitable new ideas such as growing walls, slime, an enemy generator, eggs and other things. Any challenges or concerns you’ve personally faced when working on an established intellectual property (IP) vs. a new one? Die-hard Boulder Dash fans are extremely picky when it comes to remakes of the old originals. Not only does everything have to look exactly the same, but everything also has to play exactly the same – the speed, the scrolling, the physics. To achieve this, we worked closely with the world’s greatest Boulder Dash experts including Peter Liepa, the developer of the original game. Why should gamers be excited for this new release? Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary is certainly the most comprehensive game in the series of all time. The first three games in the original Commodore and Atari look, hundreds of brand new levels in a new look, and all tested and approved by the best Boulder Dash players worldwide and with music by Chris Hülsbeck. No fan should miss out on this – we think. What would be your dream IP to work on? Could be any one, and if it’s Boulder Dash , let the world know your dream came true! Well, I am fan of classic games – and to release a new version of Manic Miner or Jet Set Willy would be something. What’s next for each of you? We have plenty of new products in our pipeline, that are well known. One game is even featuring Rockford, our beloved Boulder-Dash -Hero. We are also working on several ports from popular hits from the 80s. Stay tuned! Thanks again to Stephen Berendsen for making the time for this interview, and happy 40th anniversary to Boulder Dash ! Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary Edition will launch on July 10, 2025. Find out more about the game and links to each of the online storefronts at the link below.

2025-04-25T16:00:00,REVIEW – Sheildwall,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to fight in the Roman army? To witness battles from long ago and watch the rise of the Roman empire? Shieldwall is a 3D indie game based on historic Roman battles. In the game, your objective is to capture and secure enemy flags. You will raise a Roman army of different units to help fight and defend. These units will consist of spearmen, defenders, legionaries, and militia. Throughout the game, you will collect money which will help you upgrade your army, respawn time, money income, and flag capture speed. You will also acquire signs and standard points which upgrade things like money and health. Every army will gain regular points which show who has the upper hand in the battle. You will have a map to guide you to enemy flags and show you what enemy owns what flag. The gameplay is very basic; capture enemy flags, defend your flags, and defeat the other armies. These armies will sometimes have back-ups as well to make the game more challenging. At the beginning of every level, you will start back at square one and will have to upgrade to build a better army. Over and over again you will fight to gain victories for the Roman army. You may choose from two difficulties: easy and normal. Easy will only give you a bronze badge if you beat it but normal gives you silver or gold. The graphics in this game are very basic but change at every level to match the battle you’re playing. I came across a couple of glitches such as spears freezing and enemies freezing. Other than that, the gameplay is quite smooth and not bad for a game like itself. You will come across multiple armies in levels, some having spears, others swords, and sometimes a mix of things. These armies vary in color and will have different outfits and shields. The graphics may be basic but it still gives the game a nice touch and feeling of the actual battles. The game also adds background information to the battles which enhances the game and helps you learn about the battles. Overall, Sheildwall is a neat little 3D indie game. I enjoyed it, and I think it is great for someone who is into Roman history and resource management. In the end, this game is basic but fun.

2025-04-17T16:27:35,Mario Kart World Brings an Open World and More to Nintendo Switch 2 This June,"Start your engines — Nintendo has just dropped a turbo-charged info bomb with the Mario Kart World Direct , revealing everything we need to know about the most ambitious installment in the franchise’s history. Mario Kart World is racing onto the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch on June 5, 2025 , and it’s unlike anything the series has seen before. An Interconnected World is Your New Racetrack For the first time ever, Mario Kart goes open world — not just open course . Instead of simply selecting isolated tracks, Mario Kart World is built around an interconnected environment where courses are connected by roads, deserts, oceans, and cities. You can drive from one region to another, with weather, terrain, and even time of day changing dynamically around you. In Grand Prix mode, this world integration becomes part of the challenge. Imagine racing through Mario Bros. Circuit, then physically driving from there to Crown City for the next leg. No warp screens — just roads and rival racers between you and the next cup. More Players, More Modes, More Mayhem The series staples are back and bigger than ever — but with massive upgrades. Up to 24 players can now join races, whether in Grand Prix, the new Knockout Tour mode, or Battle Mode. Knockout Tour is a high-stakes, multi-checkpoint race where failing to reach the next checkpoint means elimination. Think Mario Kart meets battle royale. Free Roam lets you and friends cruise the open world, discover hidden coins, take on missions via P Switches, snap photos, and just vibe. Battle Mode returns with Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, now with more chaos and carnage than ever. And yes, Time Trials and VS Race return as well, with new twists like real-time ghost data and rule customization, including team-based setups and track-to-track sprints. New Tech: Charge Jumps, Rewinds, Wall-Riding, and More Mario Kart World introduces a slew of slick new mechanics: Charge Jump lets racers leap over obstacles, grind rails, or even ride along walls for secret shortcuts. Rewind allows players to reset their kart’s position after a mistake — a solo-only feature that can help recover without breaking the flow. Smart Steering, tilt controls, and auto-acceleration options are all still available for accessibility and family fun. Characters, Items, and Surprises Galore In addition to series regulars like Mario, Peach, and Bowser, the roster now includes unexpected choices like Goomba, Spike, and even Cow. The item lineup is just as wild: Coin Shells bump rivals and spawn speed-boosting coins. Kamek’s Magic creates havoc by unleashing a magical attack with various results. Ice Flower , Hammer , Mega Mushroom , and Feather all make their return from previous games with exciting effects. Dash Food from in-game drive-thrus grants speed boosts and unlocks character outfits — because fashion matters at 150cc. Play Together, Anywhere — With Faces and Voices Too Whether you’re racing couch co-op (up to four on one Switch 2), wirelessly connecting eight players locally, or hopping into massive online races with 24 global participants, Mario Kart World is built to bring people together. The new GameChat feature allows voice chat through the system’s built-in mic (no app needed), and will be free to use until March 31, 2026. Got the Switch 2 Camera ? You’ll see players’ faces next to their karts — up to four on the same system, or dozens online. It’s a fun twist that makes each race feel more personal. Launching alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, Mario Kart World isn’t just another sequel — it’s a reinvention. With expansive environments, massive multiplayer options, and more ways to play than ever before, it’s poised to become the definitive Mario Kart experience. Whether you’re out for glory in Grand Prix, exploring secrets in Free Roam, or just trying to squash your friends with a Mega Mushroom, there’s only one rule: never let off the gas.

2025-04-12T16:39:56,"Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Orders Might Begin on May 8, 2025","During the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2, 2025, Nintendo stated that pre-orders would begin on April 9. However, just a couple days later, we found out pre-orders would be delayed due to the newly announced tariffs. At that point, while the release date had not changed from June 5, 2025, we didn’t know exactly when we would be able to order our new consoles. There is one bit of interesting information we found on the Nintendo website , though: “The first batch of invitations will go out starting May 8, 2025, with additional batches of invitation emails sent periodically until purchasing on My Nintendo Store is opened to everyone.” This might not be brand new information, but it has led many to believe that’s when the new pre-order date will be. Until then, we will continue to wait with anticipation for an official pre-order date and to get our hands on Nintendo’s newest console.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.628964,Steve Cullum,NintendoFuse,https://nintendofuse.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-might-begin-on-may-8-2025/,1bcf49620858ef93fbf2906dd374ddd6c4f8af82,1043,en,0.1,"During the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2, 2025, Nintendo stated that pre-orders would begin on April 9.

2025-04-08T23:24:39,Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in NYC,"On Sunday, April 6th, I was fortunate enough to attend the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in New York City. All in all, it was a fantastic experience where I not only got to get a first look at the Switch 2 and all it’s new accessories, but got to play some of the games that were showcased in the previous Direct and following Treehouses. It was a fairly cool afternoon while I patiently waited in line with a friend of mine who also was attending the event. Upon checking in, we were given a badge and wristband with the Switch 2 branding on it and proceeded to wait in another line before the event actually started for us. Once we were let in, we were able to get our first hands on look at the Switch 2 Console and got to see the game boxes, console boxes, accessories, etc… behind a glass case while a sizzle reel played on a huge screen showcasing the games and features of the system. While I wasn’t able to turn the system on, I was able to test out the Joycons and the system itself and I can safely say, they really improved on the system in a lot of different ways. As someone who’s owned the original Switch, a Switch Lite, and OLED, the Switch 2 definitely felt more of a premium improvement. The bigger Joycons definitely felt better in the hand and the bigger sticks and buttons were a pleasant improvement. Speaking of sticks, while it has not bee confirmed that the Switch 2 doesn’t use hall-effect analog sticks, the ones on the new Joycons and Pro-Controller, definitely felt amazing. They glide in a buttery smooth way with the perfect amount of resistance in my opinion. Nintendo definitely went back to the drawing board in order to make it feel brand new and hopefully the longevity will follow suit as well. The magnetic attachment mechanism felt super sturdy and worked really well. On previous Switches, I always felt a little bit of a wobble with the Joycon attachment, with this, it was barely negligible. I was also able to put the controllers in upside-down without any worry of them getting stuck which I know has happened to others with the original. When it came to the system itself, the weight and size were great. It felt very good in hands and when I got to see the screen while playing some games that I will talk about later, it was stunning even for an LCD. I feel that it looked even better than the one on the Steamdeck. Colors were vivid and sharp. The one thing I didn’t necessarily care for on the system was the kickstand. While a great improvement over the original Switch, I personally preferred the more rigid one on the OLED models. It definitely felt sturdy, but the U-shape design made me feel a little bit worried for anyone who was young or more accident prone. It won’t end up being an issue for me, just my own observation. After a small chat about how the experience was to be conducted, we were ushered into a room filled with TVs and Switch 2’s playing Mario Kart World. We were allowed to play a few races against another attendee on both the TV and handheld and both were fantastic experiences. This was also the first time I got to use the new pro controller. Like the new Joycons, the analog sticks felt amazing along with the build quality of the controller itself. It did have a cable attached to it, so I couldn’t fully assess the weight, but it still felt good in the hands and while I’m not a fan of bottom bumper buttons, they felt nice and I’ll probably get used to them in the long run. The races I participated in were incredibly fun. Everything felt really face paced and an intense match following through. The frame rate and graphics were absolutely stunning. I had free reign to pick characters and karts as I pleased and the new grinding and wall riding mechanics were really satisfying and fun to use. It seems that they may have reworked the drifting a bit, so that may take a bit getting used to for serious racers, but all around an amazing time. Everything worked flawlessly switching between tv and handheld and was overall a fantastic time. After those races, we were taken to another room for a 24 racer knockout match, the new mode they implemented into the game. After picking my character and kart, I was allowed to mess around in free roam mode while everyone else picked their racers, which I loved in comparison to just sitting at a waiting screen. Once everyone picked theirs, we were able to pick one of a handful of prix to go through. As the race started, it was immediately a fun and hectic bout of 24 racers bumping and crashing into one another to try and take an early lead. I can definitely say it felt like one of the most intense races of my Mario Kart career. With so many racers in the beginning, it was very easy to get completely bombarded with items dropping from 3rd place the 16th in a matter of seconds. As the race went on it was amazing to see the slew of items, characters, and potential paths you can take in the game. It was a constant feeling of stress and glee passing racers as you approach one of the cutoff points in the match. One thing I would like to note is, while this experience was optimized via some form of LAN or Wifi connection, I noted barely any form of input lag and the races themselves went with no noticeable issues. Next up, I had about an hour and twenty minutes to try out some of the other games they were offering. I started with Drag X Drive since it was immediately available and I can say it was an interesting experience. I understood what they were going for with it, but personally it didn’t seem very appealing for me. My friend and I both felt a bit of strain in our arms during and after playing and the idea of needing a table in front of you was a bit off-putting to play. This was also our first experience with the mouse controls which worked very well. I think if I was to play this on a couch with my contolers at my sides like an actual wheel chair, it may have been a more enjoyable experience, but other than that it was definitely a creative game to use mouse controls with. After that I played through a slew of 3rd party and previous gen games. The Gamecube games looked and played amazingly. I was able to play a few rounds of Soul Calibur II, the best one in my opinion, and some of Wind Waker. I watched some people play Hogwarts Legacy which was running really well. Cyberpunk was surprisingly vivid and I didn’t see any issues with it. Same goes for Street Fighter 6. I didn’t get to play Civ or Hades II, but they looked great. The next games I played were upgraded and new games for the Switch 2. I played some of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. Both of which were stunning and played fluidly. Coming from the original Switch versions, you can definitely see the improvements visually and technically. It really felt how it should have been. I was able to play some of the Kirby expansion which was a lot of fun as well. I couldn’t really see a big difference in the graphic quality, but that was most likely due to the art style and me not having played it in quite some time. I got to play a bit of the Switch 2 Welcome Tour game and while I feel like it should have been a pack in game, it was a cool, intuitive way to show the features of the system itself. I was able to play a quick HD Rumble 2 and motion control game involving maracas which worked very well and definitely improved on the original HD Rumble. I also got to test out one where you tried to find the highest sensitivity of the rumble. The last mini game I got to try out was one to show the 4K output. It was a version of the original Super Mario Bros. where you played on a pixel accurate version on a 4K tv. With that being said you essential play a very tiny version of 1-1 that built the entire level as you went to the right, filling in pixel by pixel. By the end of the level, it didn’t even fill up the length of the screen. It was a cheeky and fun way to show it off. Next up was the Mario Party expansion where my friend and I competed against 2 other players in the new expansion with the camera. Here we really got to see and test out the camera they will be selling on launch. The camera has a fairly wide angle sensor easily fitting the 4 of us within frame. The mini-games we played involved us stacking Goombas on our heads by moving around, hitting a coin block as fast as you can, and basically a flailing/ screaming match. They worked fairly well, but the quality due to the AI background removal and games themselves felt like something I’d play at one of those dine-and-play arcades. The last quick play game I did was Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. While I was playing in performance mode, it looked visually stunning and very fluid. They really kept the Metroid Prime essence in the game and it was a blast to play. I pretty much went through the first level they showed in the Treehouse, but it was a lot of fun. I was able to play with 3 different control schemes. Mouse mode, was great and very intuitive, even though it took me a few moments to get used to it since I’m not much of a PC shooter player. Motion control mode was a lot of fun as well and worked really well, and the same goes for the standard analog stick controls. Playing through the game, attacking the space pirate enemies and a short boss battle, was all around fantastic and a definitely day one purchase for me when it releases. After my time was up, it was now time to go to another room to play some Donkey Kong: Bananza. This game looked and felt amazing. It definitely gave me the same vibe as Mario: Odyssey along with a sprinkle of BotW. I was able to run around the areas shown in the Treehouse and was free to roam around and complete challenges, collecting bananas and gold. I will say they really make a cathartic experience breaking nearly everything around you, I can definitely see myself spending a few hours after a long day at work just breaking things. The mechanics worked well, and it was very fun to break, throw, and surf a bunch of objects I found. I was even lucky enough to see my dear Cranky Kong which the attendant said, not many were able to find. It definitely seems like with the Universal park and this, DK is definitely making a comeback. At the end of the event, attendees were given a really cool Switch 2 branded bookbag, which was pretty awesome. It was an amazing experience and seeing Nintendo fans both children and adults alike faces light up with joy while playing the games really hit home what it means to be a part of the gaming industry as a whole. I loved the entire experience and once the pricing issues get sorted out, I will definitely be throwing my wallet at Nintendo to add the Switch 2 to my gaming library.",2025-12-17T11:45:54.629460,Jared Krinsky,NintendoFuse,https://nintendofuse.com/nintendo-switch-2-experience-in-nyc/,d8c7ea6f1f50c194a76c9e2d2185aff1ba429f47,1044,en,0.1,"On Sunday, April 6th, I was fortunate enough to attend the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in New York City.

2025-03-27T15:40:30,"Nintendo Today, Virtual Game Cards, Metroid Prime 4, and More","Just ahead of the upcoming Nintendo Direct for Nintendo Switch 2 on April 2, 2025, we were treated to a Nintendo Direct focused on the current Switch. Most of the 37-minute video was focused on providing a lot of new info for upcoming games like Metroid Prime 4 and very little info for newly announced games like Tamodachi Life: Living the Dream , but we also learned about a new feature coming to Switch and a new smartphone app for Nintendo calendar and news. Metroid Prime 4 Beyond will drop Samus on a mysterious planet called Vieweros, where there is a colossal tree in the center. As she scans relics and fights enemy aliens, she is granted psychic abilities that allow her to operate magnetisms, open doors, and control the trajectory of her beams. Someone mysterious also calls her “Chosen One.” We were told there will be threads intertwining beyond space and time, and we saw either a new suit/form in red and purple–or maybe it was a new character–at the end of this segment. After a firmware update in late April 2025, the new Virtual Game Card feature will allow players to assign games to a specific system. For example, if you have two Nintendo Switch systems, you can assign a Zelda game to your home Switch and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to your Switch Lite for when you travel. You can use up to 2 systems at a time, though. Additionally, you can also loan games to one family member at a time for up to two weeks–just as long as you are on the same Nintendo family account. This essentially lets players move and loan their digital games just like they can with their physical games. The final announcement of this Nintendo Direct moved the attention to smart devices. Later today, March 27, 2025, Nintendo will launch a new app called Nintendo Today as a way to communicate even more directly with the fans. This calendar and news app will be updated daily with Nintendo game events and news about existing and upcoming games and systems–including information about Nintendo Switch 2 after the Nintendo Direct on April 2. It will also allow for Nintendo-themed calendar widgets that you can use on your smart device home screen.

2025-03-06T15:57:17,REVIEW – Big Helmet Heroes,"If you’re old enough, like me, you remember the times spent playing co-op games with your friends in their parents’ living room, den, etc. I can still remember our gaming sessions going long into the night while we ate pizza, drank 2 liters of soda, and competitively battled each other in Goldeneye, Time Splitters, Turok, and other games of that ilk. But alas, time moves on. As the years have gone by, the way in which we play has evolved. People grow up, move out of their parents’ houses, and move away, but the desire to play together remained. To fill that couch co-op void, people turned to online gaming, and from my perspective, it seems to be the way many people prefer to play games with each other, from the comfort of their own home, able to play with people across the globe. However, I am not in that majority, and I enjoy single player games and good couch co-ops when they can be found. Sure, there have been some good couch co-ops released over the years, and some that weren’t so good. For those of us who crave a satisfying co-op in 2025, I have good news for you, and it comes in three words. BIG. Helmet. Heroes. Big Helmet Heroes is a 3D, beat ‘em up action game developed by Exalted Studios. You or you and a friend play as 1 of 2 BIG helmeted heroes as you fight your way through hordes of goblins and other dastardly villains over the course of 20 levels, as you attempt to rescue the princess. I couldn’t help but grin with childlike glee as I booted up the game and watched the intro. It was funny, goofy, and above all, entertaining. This feeling stayed with me as I went through the tutorial and subsequent levels. The titular heroes are cute and cartoony and indeed sport some big helmets. Even the enemies have a cute and childlike appeal to them, even as they try to smash, swat, blow you up, etc. The aesthetics remind me of when I would play with action figures as a kid, just taking all these toys and pretending they were battling. Speaking of battling, when you land a certain amount of successful attacks (combo), I believe around 15 hits, a group of big knights pop up from the bottom of the screen and cheer you on. It’s such a neat extra effect, but it makes me smile every time. It reminds me of when I would play Mortal Kombat on my Super Nintendo and there would be that guy that would pop out from the side and shout “Toasty!”. The graphics and art style are a visual treat for your eyes. The soundtrack and sound effects are upbeat, fun to listen to, and add to the overall ambience, making for a more immersive experience. Alright, so let’s move onto gameplay. You fight across several stages of varying design, engaging in simple combat with enemies of varying design, all on your way to rescue the princess. There are 3 forms of attack – melee, ranged, and special – plus the option to do a dodge roll to avoid attacks. Your primary form of attack is melee and is a simple one button attack which you can spam, and after a few repeated attacks, your melee weapon will launch away from you for a short, brief ranged attack. Next up are ranged attacks. You will find ranged weapons scattered throughout each level hidden in destructible objects, such as hay bales, barrels, and crates. Aside from the standard crossbow and a couple of others, most of the ranged weapons/special melee weapons are off the wall and so much fun to use. Ah, how much fun have I had smashing baddies with an electrified bug zapper or bludgeoning a goblin with an electric guitar. It is quite satisfying to watch the bad guys shake and convulse after hitting them with the fly swatter – fun times! You can freeze enemies with a freeze ray (Mr. Freeze from Batman anyone?) or shoot poison at your targets. Clearly, I’ve been enjoying my time playing. Now, onto special attacks. As you defeat enemies, your special attack meter gradually fills, and occasionally you’ll collect a power-up that refills a good chunk of your special meter. Once that is filled, you can unleash your special attack. Each hero has a unique special attack. One hero grows huge and stomps all over the enemies, while another creates a sandstorm which turns the enemies into sand versions of themselves, which you can hit, and they just fall apart. There are many more to play around with and you will have ample opportunities to do so. You also earn gifts that float down from the sky via crates and parachutes. The way to earn these surprising, yet welcome gifts is by collecting flowers. These flowers are collected either by defeating enemies or (pause for dramatic effect…) petting sheep. That’s right! You pet/interact with sheep and get rewarded with flowers. So be sure to pet those sheep. One last point I want to mention – explore the levels as much you can. There are small “side-missions” that are never explained really but explore enough and you will find them. They are small challenges, but they add a little extra to the overall experience. Big Helmet Heroes is a fun, entertaining beat ‘em up couch co-op game that can be played solo or with a friend. The cartoony aesthetics, on point audio and entertaining gameplay are sure to put a smile on your face. I know it did for me, and I recommend you check it out.

2025-02-10T16:00:00,REVIEW – Dead Cells,"Fight, upgrade, explore, die. Will you make it? Can you possibly escape the inescapable? Or will you fall to the hand of monsters set on destroying you? Dead Cells is a 2D platformer made by Evil Empire and Motion Twin. In this roguelike Metroidvania, you are the Beheaded, a prisoner who wakes up and has to escape an island partially infected with a disease known as the Malaise. As you make your great escape, you come across monsters and bosses. The game gets more difficult the further you progress, but finally, you’re at the end… Or so you thought. Instead, you’re in the middle of fighting the final boss, but then you die. Over and over again, you die–each time going back to the beginning. So your goal is to upgrade, defend, and make your way to the end without dying at all. There are multiple areas to explore, featuring a beautiful world of ever-changing scenery. The visuals are smooth and flawless and the background adds a nice touch of scenery that compliments the levels. The monsters and characters are animated very well. Each level and monster has its own unique colors which adds a nice touch to the whole game. You will come across some enemies that are animated differently than others but might have the same function maybe with a spin. The maps are randomly generated, but the scenery doesn’t change. The controls are very simplistic and easy to use and I quickly got the hang of them. You have four slots: two for weapons and two for traps. You will use your simple x and y buttons and triggers for these. Overall, Dead Cells runs very smoothly. You can release traps and fight with both melee and long-ranged weapons. As I stated earlier, the enemies and bosses will get harder the further you progress, but this certainly feels more satisfying when you beat them! You also come across mini-bosses, or Elites. Fighting them will sometimes give you Runes, which grant you special abilities, but more on that later. You can also upgrade your weapons and health with power scrolls and buy new weapons. Every level, you will encounter different enemy types and more of them. This game is great for those who like beating up enemies and fighting, as every hit is an achievement. You won’t be able to rely solely on offensive moves to progress, though- you’ll have to perfect dodging as well. Failing to dodge will be frustrating for sure, but that’s nothing compared to the feeling of triumph when you make a successful dodge, then counter to strike that enemy down! You can use Cells that you get from enemies to upgrade and purchase items and mutations from the Cell Keeper. Mutations are special abilities that can help you in the game and can be acquired in the area between levels. You may also choose to acquire Aspects in the game before the run starts. These also give you special abilities but will prevent you from getting Boss Cells. The Boss Cells are special cells that you get every time you beat the game. To help you in combat, you’ll find amulets which have special effects. Like stomping on the ground to make fire spring up. Lastly, you will come across Runes, which allow you to do things like teleport and break through the ground. All of these great abilities help you to beat the game and make it easier. Once you finally beat the game and go back to the beginning, you have the option to go through the game again or go on to the Giant DLC, where, you’ll fight the giant you see at the beginning. You may also purchase other DLCs, which provide even more areas to explore and bosses to defeat. But if you choose to go through the main game again, you’ll get Boss Cells from the last boss, which will make the game harder and open special doors. All of these options really help if you want a change of scenery. In the end, I give Dead Cells a solid 5 out of 5. This is such a great indie game, especially for fans of roguelikes. It does contain some language and gore, though, so it is for older audiences. It is truly a great game and I highly recommend it. With beautiful scenery, all the fighting, and pushing yourself to make it to the end, Dead Cells is worth playing. It is full of exciting fights, secrets, and many, many deaths, all of which make it an awesome game and a must-buy.

2024-08-23T17:46:07,"Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Ending on November 28, 2024","While Animal Crossing has been quite popular almost since the original Animal Forest game on N64 in Japan, the most loved versions have been on Nintendo’s handheld consoles . So in 2017, Nintendo wanted to capitalize on an even bigger user base, bringing the beloved cozy sim to mobile devices in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp . Rather than the role you typically play as a participant in the world, Pocket Camp makes you the camp manager, as you are told by Isabelle. So your goal is to build creative campsites, collect furniture and other items, and celebrate special events with over 100 animal friends. While the game had a high number of downloads initially, even hitting a large spike in 2020 during the height of Animal Crossing: New Horizons for Nintendo Switch, its popularity has decreased over the last couple of years. The last update for the game came one month ago, when they updated it with summer items and events, increased the maximum animal friendship level, added a new Isles of Style to Gulliver’s Ship, and added adjustments to the on-screen display and design elements. This might be the last update, however, because Nintendo just announced services will be ending soon. The online service for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp will end on Nov. 28, 2024 at 7:00 AM PT. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who has supported the title since service began. We will continue distributing in-game events and adding items until the service ends. -Nintendo PR If you have any Leaf Tickets in the game, Nintendo has stated, “Leaf Ticket sales will cease on November 26th, 2024 at 10:00 PM (PST). You will be able to redeem Leaf Tickets until end of the service on November 28th, 2024 at 7:00 AM (PST).” Pocket Camp also had a subscription service called Pocket Camp Club, which will also end on November 29. If you want to gain access to the subscription service, you must do so before October 28, at which time there is scheduled maintenance that will remove the subscription option and the automatic renewal of said subscription. In some more unfortunate news, Nintendo stated , “If your membership is set to end after the maintenance period listed above, you will not be refunded even if you cancel membership on your own.” To compensate you, though, you will receive an in-game badge that signifies the plan you were once a member of. This badge also allows you to continue playing the game with those benefits until service ends on November 29, even if your subscription was set to end between October 28 and November 29. (See image below for more details). ・The Pocket Camp Journal and monthly benefits (i.e. Leaf Tickets and fortune cookies) are excluded. ・A Free Trial membership of the Happy Helper Plan will not generate a badge. -Nintendo If you played Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp , are you going to miss it?

Nintendo also stated, “Players can carry their progress forward to the full version of the game if purchased,” after it launches on August 29. In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it—much like the victims of Emio, the Smiling man—a killer of urban legend. Playing as an assistant private investigator, you are tasked with helping police solve this crime, which is reminiscent of a series of unsolved murders from 18 years ago. Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat? Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man urban legend, or the origin of it? As part of the continuing adventures of the Utsugi Detective Agency, for the first time in the Famicom Detective Club series, play as familiar character Ayumi Tachibana during select portions of the story.

2025-12-02T15:27:00,Helldivers Movie Lands Fast & Furious Director Justin Lin,"Helldivers is preparing to launch a dropship to a theater near you via an upcoming film adaptation, and it just landed a big-time director. Justin Lin, best known for directing several installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, will helm the project. Per The Hollywood Reporter , the Helldivers movie comes from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with Justin Lin’s Perfect Storm Entertainment helping produce. Lin’s credits include directing most of the installments in the Fast & Furious series, starting with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and continuing with Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), F9 (2021), and Fast X (2023). According to THR ’s sources, Lin is not a gamer and is leveraging this in his pitch to “find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.” The script for Helldivers is penned by Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the It and Annabelle franchises, as well as The Nun . Dauberman also wrote this year’s Until Dawn , so Helldivers will be his second video game adaptation. <img alt=""Game Informer News"" loading=""lazy"" width=""800"" height=""450"" src=""https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2025/07/03/70488f70/helldivers2-xbox.jpg.webp"">






  Helldivers 2 Given that Helldivers is essentially a video game version of the cult classic film Starship Troopers , turning it into a movie does feel like the snake eating its tail. Helldivers centers on soldiers hailing from Super Earth, an uber-patriotic managed democracy, who defend the planet in an intergalactic war against alien bugs, as well as killer robots and other threats.

2025-12-01T22:30:00,Paramount Announces A New 'Sonic Universe' Film For Holiday 2028,"Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel. Per Deadline , all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively. Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4 , scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it’s not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion. Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ Knuckles series?  Let us know what you think in the comments.

Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA. “Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I’m rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!” Grivel’s LinkedIn post announcing the news reads . “A very special team and project to me,” the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji. (Thanks to GamesRadar , which noticed this post before we did. ) According to his LinkedIn profile, Grivel worked at Ubisoft from 2011 to 2022, spending most of his time at the Toronto offices as a senior or lead game designer, with credits on projects like Assassin’s Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, 6, and Primal, and most importantly, Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting. Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it’s unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it’s a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here’s hoping we’ll see a more concrete update sometime soon.

2025-11-27T19:00:00,Dragon Quest Reimagined Producer On Remaking A Classic: 'We Rebuilt Everything From The Ground Up',"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the latest game to grace the cover of <em>Game Informer</em>, and to learn more about this game for the cover story, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to play two hours of the game and interview the team behind it, too. With this being the second remake of Dragon Quest VII, following the 2016 Nintendo 3DS remake, I was curious about where you even start with a project like this.&nbsp; So I asked producer Takeshi Ichikawa and director Masato Yagi about their thought processes behind developing the game, which elements are sacred ground in Dragon Quest VII, if there’s any pressure involved, and more. Here’s what I learned. <img alt=""Game Informer News"" loading=""lazy"" width=""800"" height=""450"" src=""https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2025/11/06/bd3be134/maribel_close.jpg.webp""> “To be honest, I did feel some pressure, but for the most part, I felt the same as Ichikawa here,” Yagi tells me. “I was excited with the idea of bringing these new changes.” Ichikawa, on the other hand, didn’t feel much pressure. “I was certainly excited with the prospect of bringing these changes,” he tells me. “When we first kicked off the project, we had in mind three main components that we really wanted to reimagine for this version; the first one being the visuals, the second one being the scenario or the story, and the third one being the battle. […] It is one of the most popular installments in the series, but our goal was to offer a reimagined experience to players all around the world. But again, I didn’t really necessarily feel pressure.” When I ask where the team started with Reimagined, Ichikawa explains it’s a remake focused on showcasing what makes Dragon Quest VII so great to modern audiences. That means keeping the story intact, although lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi explained to me in a different interview how the team streamlined the main scenario; you can read about that here . <img alt=""Game Informer News"" loading=""lazy"" width=""800"" height=""450"" src=""https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2025/11/06/5a50328f/puzzle.jpg.webp""> “I really thought that the story of the original was essential to keep,” Ichikawa says. “When you look at [all of the] mainline installments, Dragon Quest VII’s story is quite unique and not really like the others. These characters […] go through a lot of struggles, and it is, overall, kind of a bit darker. That [darkness] is the one thing that I wanted to retain for sure in the remake.” Yagi agrees with Ichikawa, telling me in a series full of lighthearted stories with a more loving tone, Dragon Quest VII is darker. He remembers asking, “Is this actually a Dragon Quest story?” while playing the original game on PlayStation. Retaining this tone was important for Reimagined, he adds, lightly dipping into spoiler territory to discuss Prince Kiefer, a party member of the game. I won’t spoil anything here, but if you’re familiar with the game, Kiefer makes a crucial decision in the story, and though in the initial stages of development the team pondered keeping it (and other narrative moments) in the game, it remained. “That’s definitely one thing that we were debating if we should keep or not, but in the end, we decided it’s just too essential for the story,” Yagi says. “There are a lot of areas where we debated to keep or not keep, but in the end, for the most part, we decided to keep [things in place]. But it’s not keeping them as is. We did end up making some little adjustments and arrangements here and there.” <img alt=""Game Informer News"" loading=""lazy"" width=""800"" height=""450"" src=""https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2025/11/06/83061014/combat_4.jpg.webp""> Speaking more broadly, Yagi says the team behind Reimagined “really wanted to make the overall game experience more immersive for our players [and that’s why we streamlined the story. It’s also why we made some adjustments to the combat.” Closing out our conversation on the philosophy behind this remake, Ichikawa tells me, “Reimagined” implies everything is new. He says, “We really built everything from the ground up. We rebuilt everything, aside from the scenario, from scratch. In order to convey that sentiment, we felt that ‘Reimagined’ would be the most adequate title instead of ‘Remake.'” Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.

If you're familiar with the history of this specific Dragon Quest entry, then you likely already know Reimagined is the second time Square Enix has remade Dragon Quest VII.&nbsp; It released the original Dragon Quest VII in 2000 on PlayStation in Japan and a year later as Dragon Warrior VII in the U.S. Square Enix remade it for the Nintendo 3DS, launching Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past in 2013 in Japan before releasing it in the West in 2016.

2025-11-25T19:20:00,Bungie Shares Deep Dive On Star Wars-Inspired Destiny 2: Renegades,"Bungie today offered a deep dive look at the new Destiny 2: Renegades release, which is scheduled to arrive for players next week, on December 2. The new major release for the game is an unusual one, as it’s rooted in a partnership with Star Wars. A quick look through the early visuals of the game don’t leave much room for doubt on that, as there are lots of things that look like lightsabers, stormtroopers, and villainous Sith. But as today’s vidoc makes clear, Bungie is trying to thread a more nuanced line with this release that it first appears. While plenty of features may look like Star Wars, the team is going to great pains to make sure it remains a true and canon Destiny experience. Those aren’t lightsabers but rather Praxic Blades. Those aren’t stormtroopers but instead members of the surging Barant Imperium. And that’s not a Sith – it’s a dangerous new big bad named Dredgen Bael. <img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/no_compression/public/2025/11/25/00211438/destiny_2_renegades_vidoc_making_of_a_renegade_6-20_screenshot.jpg.webp"" alt=""Game Informer News"" class=""image-style-no-compression""> Whether the developer can pull off keeping those distinctions or not will be a matter to decide once we can play the game, but the early descriptions and footage offer good reason to be excited. The storyline appears to focus strongly on Drifter as a central character, acting as a conduit into some of the criminal underworld of the solar system. With his scoundrel demeanor, Drifter pretty clearly nods a bit toward characters like Han Solo in the Star Wars fiction. We also get to know a character that has been mentioned in the past in written lore entries for Destiny. Aunor Mahal is about as close as the game is likely to have to a Jedi, with her Praxic Blade that she is using to fight against Dredgen Bael. Players will pledge to a faction and build up reputation as they fight across the Lawless Frontier, an explorable space with a dedicated social hub in the form of Tharsis Outpost. Factions include the anarchist Eliksni biker gang called The Pikers, the group of sentient Vex call the Tharsis Reformation, and the rogue Cabal called Totality Division. You’ll run jobs for these factions like smuggling, bounty hunts, and sabotage-focused missions. <img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/no_compression/public/2025/11/25/a1c9ad76/destiny_2_renegades_vidoc_making_of_a_renegade_9-0_screenshot.jpg.webp"" alt=""Game Informer News"" class=""image-style-no-compression""> While Aunor is shown in some pretty slick lightsaber-esque battles, NPCs aren’t the only people getting fun new Star Wars-themed toys to play with. Players will also be able to wield Praxic Blades, and will even be able to try out different fighting styles, very much like a Jedi. With the exotic primary, kinetic Praxic Blade, you can deflect attacks, melee attack enemies, and even throw. And, just to set clear expectations, Bungie has shared that the Praxic Blade won’t be unique to this content drop; it will continue to be a relevant weapon in future expansions to the game. Renegades also introduces new Blasters inspired by Star Wars, including several distinct variants, from dynamic blasters that hit harder with brute force, to more fast-firing balanced blasters. Blasters overheat and must cool down, rather than have a traditional magazine reload. We also learned about a special solar exotic crossbow called Heirloom, inspired by Chewbacca’s weapon in the movies. Players will also be able to pick up different “renegade abilities,” that seem in some way to tie together with the faction you work for. Across all the new content Bungie showed off today, one of the features that stood out the most was the music. By drawing direct inspiration from the Star Wars scores, arguably some of the most extensively varied and beloved of all film music, the new Destiny themes that were part of this preview presentation were, quite simply, riveting. The Renegades experience may be worth returning to play if only to hear more of that great music in action. There’s plenty more to learn in the complete rundown. Check out the full vidoc below to get a comprehensive look at what Bungie is cooking up. Destiny 2 continues its march into the future with Renegades on December 2.

But as part of this trip, I interviewed Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii for 90 minutes about all kinds of topics, including the aforementioned competition between his franchise and Final Fantasy.

Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves. “In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you’re not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games. So I thought that was a really interesting and stark difference between Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, but I didn’t necessarily see them as a rival back then.” Horii says in Dragon Quest, protagonists don’t “just start talking on their own.” “Final Fantasy, again, [the protagonists] just talk a lot,” he continues. “I do like Final Fantasy, though. When I first saw Final Fantasy X, I recall feeling this was the ultimate perfection of Final Fantasy.” Great taste, Horii.

2025-11-25T16:01:00,FX Announces Far Cry Anthology Series Coming To Hulu From Alien: Earth And It's Always Sunny Creators,"FX is developing an anthology TV series adapting Ubisoft’s Far Cry franchise. The upcoming show will stream on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally. According to a press release, the series will “retain Far Cry’s signature standalone storytelling format” and each season will take place in a new setting and star a different cast. Far Cry is being helmed by executive producers Noah Hawley, creator of FX’s Fargo and Alien: Earth , and Rob Mac (formerly McElhenney after a legal name change this summer), creator of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia . Mac, who also co-wrote and stars in the FX docuseries Welcome to Wrexham and Apple TV’s Mythic Quest, will join the cast of Far Cry in the starring role. “What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley in a press release. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.” “Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” said Rob Mac in a press release. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.” <img alt=""Game Informer News"" loading=""lazy"" width=""800"" height=""450"" src=""https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2021/10/05/077364c5/fc6_ambush.jpg.webp"">






  Far Cry 6 Far Cry ’s executive producer credits also include names from various production companies, such as Emilia Serrano (26 Keys), Nick Frenkel (3 Arts), Jackie Cohn (More Better), and John Campisi. Ubisoft Film & Television executives Gerard Guillemot, John Campisi, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill are also involved. FX’s Far Cry has no premiere date or announced cast besides Rob Mac. Whether it’s the 2010 Prince of Persia film or the 2016 Assassin’s Creed film, Ubisoft has never been shy about bringing its franchises to the big and small screens. Far Cry already has a TV show to its name in the form of 2023’s Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix , an adaptation of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. There is also the terrible 2008 Uwe Boll Far Cry film, but perhaps that is best forgotten. Other recent Ubisoft adaptations include a live-action Assassin’s Creed series currently in development by Netflix, and the animated show Splinter Cell: Deathwatch , which premiered on Netflix in October, is nominated for a Best Adaptation trophy for this year’s Game Awards .

2025-12-13T14:06:17,How to Get Agris Ultimate Skill in Anime Final Quest,"Agris (Igris from the Solo Leveling anime) is one of the strongest ultimate skills in AFQ. However, obtaining it isn’t easy if you’re F2P. In the guide below, we will explain how to get the Agris ultimate skill in Anime Final Quest for free , including the requirements, what the ultimate skill does, the paid cosmetics, and other important information. How to Get Agris in Anime Final Quest for Free Image by Gamepur To get the Agris ultimate skill in Anime Final Quest , talk to Fiji’s Quest NPC in the main lobby, next to the Agris statue. While talking, choose the “ How do I obtain him? ” dialogue option, and the Agris quest screen will open. You’ll need to be Level 5+ to start the questline, which you can reach just by completing the first dungeon. Once you’ve completed the questline and claimed all the rewards , you’ll receive the Agris ultimate skill in your inventory . Anime Final Quest Codes : Use these AFQ codes to get free rerolls and other currency/resources! Complete Agris Quest List Image by Gamepur Here is the list of all the Agris sub-quests , their requirements , rewards , and how to complete them , to make tracking the questline easier. The whole questline should be doable within 20 dungeon clears , which is the hardest requirement of all. Quest Reward Notes on How to Complete Complete 20 Dungeons 4 Weapon Lucky Spins N/A Kill 500 Enemies 10K Gold N/A Kill Golem Boss in Hard Mode 3 Times 3 Normal Gear Spins Do dungeons on Hard difficulty. Complete 3 Nightmare Dungeons 3 Runes Do dungeons on Nightmare difficulty.

You can find the bundle in the in-game shop. What Does the Agris Sword Cosmetic Do? The Agris sword cosmetic gives you +75 Health and +20% Crit Chance . Note that this is only a cosmetic , and not an actual weapon . It will only replace your weapon’s looks and give you bonus stats. The base skills of your weapon will stay the same. Anime Final Quest Agris FAQ How long does the Agris event last? The Agris quests last until December 19th , and you can obtain the ultimate skill for free until then. The Agris limited bundle will last longer, until December 26th , and you can obtain both the cosmetic and the ultimate skill until then with Robux. Is the Agris Robux bundle worth it? The +75 HP and +20% Crit Chance are nice buffs from the Agris sword, but they aren’t as OP as those of other cosmetics. Therefore, it’s not really worth buying the bundle , unless you really need the other things besides the weapon cosmetic. How to craft the Strongest Cape? You can craft the Strongest Cape by clicking on Crafting on the left-side menu. You’ll need 1x Golem’s Heart (drops from 1st dungeon), 4x Monkey Hair (drops from 2nd dungeon), and 5x Goblin Armor Piece (drops from 1st dungeon). That covers all you need to know about the Agris event in Anime Final Quest and how to get its rewards.

YES Best Harpoon & Speargun Progression in Spear Fishing In the list below is the optimal progression of harpoon and speargun purchases in Spear Fishing. Generally, you’ll want to spend as few gems as possible , as their supply is somewhat limited , and that’s why it’s not recommended to buy every speargun . For harpoons, though, you can buy most of them, but some have subpar stats compared to how much they cost. Basic Harpoon (100 DMG) : This is the harpoon that you start with. Cost : Free Refined Harpoon (250 DMG) : This is the harpoon that you buy during the tutorial. It’s decent for fishing in the Beginner River. Cost : 300 Coins Sea King Trident (1,200 DMG) : Join the Fishgig Game Roblox group and claim this trident. It has decent stats and will carry you through the early game, allowing you to skip both the Steel Harpoon and the Alloy Harpoon. Cost : Free Abyss Trident (2,600 DMG) : This is a decent harpoon for farming in the Rushing Stream and unlocking album entries. Farm various fish to get as many gems as possible (min 300) for your next purchase. Cost : 15,000 Coins Basic Speargun (38,000 DMG) : This is the cheapest speargun, and it is almost as good as the 1M coins harpoon. Getting this one will speed up your progress immensely. Cost: 300 Gems Pirate Spear (75,000 DMG) : Farm up 5M coins with the Basic Speargun, and then buy the Pirate Spear. It’s the best harpoon in Spear Fishing and the one you can use throughout the end-game farming. Cost : 5,000,000 Coins Golden Speargun (468,000 DMG) : The Golden Speargun is the best weapon in Spear Fishing, and you’ll want to save up for it as you grind later on. Make sure to get all codes and the daily/quest rewards to get as many gems as possible. Cost: 3,000 Gems Spear Fishing Progression Tips & Tricks Don’t Buy Bait With Gems : You’ll need gems for spearguns, and that’s why it’s really not worth it to spend them on bait. Farm Rare Fish : Rare fish glow blue and have the best cost/HP ratio early on, making them relatively easy to farm, while giving you a lot of coins whenever you sell them. Don’t Farm Epic Fish : These have a somewhat higher sell price than rare fish, but also much more HP. They are rarely worth farming. Focus on Mutated Fish : Fish with mutations give you much more coins, and that’s why it’s always better to focus on them. However, they do have more HP. Fill the Album and Get Gems for a Speargun : As soon as you get the Basic Speargun, you’ll start speedrunning through the game. The best way to get gems to buy them is to fill the album. Farm Legendary Fish Later : Legendary fish have a lot less HP than Mythic fish and a fairly decent sell price. Farm only them until you get one of the end-game harpoons/spearguns. Spear Fishing Harpoon & Speargun FAQ How to get guns in Spear Fishing? You can buy guns/spearguns at the GunShop Uzi NPC , and they usually cost gems . Some spearguns, like the Carbon Speargun, can be obtained via events and daily logins. What is the best weapon in Spear Fishing?

2025-12-12T23:07:06,Routine Review – A Stirring Space Horror,"After originally being unveiled at Gamescom thirteen years ago, Routine’s long, drawn-out gestation period has been well-documented. It’s rare for that kind of creative turmoil to result in something of substance, but they do say pressure makes diamonds, and Routine is just that; it’s a diamond in the rough. At the eleventh hour, in what has been a full year for video games, Lunar Software has delivered a terrifying, isolated tour of a derelict lunar base which confidently riffs on the same blend of survival horror and analogue retro-tech that made Alien Isolation so intoxicating, while plunging players into a world that commands their attention. After the moon dust settles and Routine’s story comes to a close, I can’t say I immediately took anything away from it. Quite the opposite, I left me rattled, perplexed, and desperately seeking Google. While it uses diary and audio logs to colour in between the narrative lines to give an account of things past and present, its allegorical meaning, once ruminated on, will be what sticks with you. I appreciate Routine’s approach to storytelling so much, and its last act and ending—a truly bold closing statement—feels plucked from the Alex Garland playbook, as it explores chaotic nature and rebirth. Like so many of the last decade’s horror titles, Routine loves to let players decay, primarily mentally, within small stretches that feel desperate, unwinnable, and claustrophobic. Armed with nothing but a Cosmonaut Assistance Tool, primarily designed to be a work multitool, players wander the minimalist station’s corridors, rife with dread, fearing that a swift end, in the form of a hostile robot, waits around each corner. Violent as they are once they accost you, it’s how they torment you otherwise that I’ll long remember, whether it’s their plodding, patrolling footsteps echoing through the base’s otherwise desolate halls, or their distinctly inhuman whirring that accompanies their area scan function. Their design and function are so inherently scary, I still found myself slowing to a crawl despite their other technical faults. What I mean by that is the intelligence isn’t quite that switched on, and their patrols appeared random, which led to plenty of tedious moments where, when waiting for a robot to return to its patrol and leave, it’d simply park itself conveniently outside of the room you’re in, leading to an inevitable conflict. The biggest problem here is how many bouts of waiting can undercut the tension that, up until that point, had been hard-earned. If you aren’t a big scaredy cat like me, these patrol bots are simple to avoid, although I do wish the game borrowed from its contemporaries and included more options for hiding. You’ll make do by ducking into a vent or by waiting it out beneath a desk, but a few more options might have helped the stealthier side of Routine feel less controlled. Routine places such a premium on observation and really digging into every careful detail of a scene that its brand of puzzle-solving is bound to be a bit too obtuse for some people. The whole game is rather unguided, cutting the apron strings to encourage and reward players who are happy not to have their hands held throughout. It’s a large part of what I think people’s mileage with Routine will vary so greatly, because no task in the game is a simple fix; it has the potential to be a three-hour game, and it also has the potential to be a twelve-hour game. The gameplay’s great hook is the aforementioned Cosmonaut Assistance Tool, or the C.A.T. for short. It’s a modular tool that looks like a cross between a barcode scanner and a camcorder; its analogue appeal is undeniable, but its greatest strength lies in its tactile nature. I can’t overstate how pivotal the tool’s functions are to the game’s brand of panicked horror. Its every mode, including the backlight, has a real-world function that neatly ties into its use case within the context of Routine’s riddles, and each of these functions, which can be seen when looking at the side of the unit, must be toggled individually by the player. Right down to the degauss button, the C.A.T. is a special, soon-to-be-iconic, quasi-weapon that will immediately and unmistakably be linked, like a crowbar to Half-Life, to Routine forever. Of the qualms I have with the C.A.T., at least one is acceptable. The thing chews through batteries, and for some unexplainable reason, we’re never able to pocket a spare. Considering it’s an essential and unavoidable means to progress, having to sift through countertops for a mislaid battery can be a bother. With that said, they are plentiful in most areas, and it’s an easy way for the team to ratchet up the tension through simple withholding. The one thing I couldn’t quite reconcile is the character’s inability to address the C.A.T. without standing bolt upright. For a game that respects stealth so much, even going as far as to implement a tremendous lean mechanic, this choice feels like a bit of a misfire. I can’t speak to how Routine performs on console as yet, but I did experience some impossibly long load times playing on my ASUS ROG Ally. More specific to the game itself, I did manage to get caught in a level’s geometry more than once, often courtesy of a robot tossing me aside into a wall, which caused me to get lodged in it. This often led to cheap deaths and the loss of decent chunks of progress. The only thing scarier than the Type-05 robots themselves is the game’s less-than-generous checkpointing. Another thing I do hate is the inability to pause; there’s no justifiable reason to deny a player’s option to seek a brief reprieve. With art design philosophies that speak to the game’s narrative roots within the seventies, Routine beautifully encapsulates the retro, lo-fi aesthetic that has, for fifty years, defined this particular era of horror. Hundreds of thousands of kilometres from Earth, untouched by half a century of progress, Routine’s lunar base is a time capsule, fixed in time and space. Its liminal spaces would seem completely harmless were it not for the robots and other nightmares manning the halls. It’s a nitpick, but I do think the enemy design is excellent ; however, it’s often hindered by wonky animation. I couldn’t possibly fault the sound design, though. It’s as near to perfect as possible and demands the use of a good set of headphones. There’s a certain nostalgia that’s attached to the chirping and grinding of the station’s dated terminals; it scratches the part of my brain that fondly recalls slow but so reliable dial-up modems and CRT monitors. As I’ve waxed on already, the robots are nerve-shredding in their presentation, but it’s what follows them that’ll truly haunt you. Like Jerry Goldsmith’s score for Alien, N.J. Apostol’s score harnesses flightful wind instruments and brandishes them with ominous intent, creating a soundscape that feels most unearthly. Once you settle into its rhythm and experience its world and story on its terms, Routine is a genuinely gripping, slow-burning kind of horror game that we don’t see enough of. With no support of any kind, it throws you into its harsh world unaided, and if you’re able to tread water long enough to come to terms with what it is, you’ll enjoy the swim. With that said, if you’re not wired in and absorbing everything, its puzzles can be a tad obtuse, which, along with minor problems with the A.I. and the controls, might turn people off before the game is able to get its hooks in. The PC version of this game was played for the purpose of this review. A digital review code was provided by the publisher. Conclusion Routine is a tense, atmospheric adventure through an unforgiving lunar base where everything is out to kill you. It has its imperfections, but, in the face of the narrative and puzzle craft that beckons you through every minute of Routine, they seem infinitesimally small. Positives Great mystery that warrants keen exploration and attention to detail The C.A.T. is a bloody cool tool that helps in building tension through tactile use Sound design is top tier Negatives The game's stealth can be undercut by the finicky C.A.T. controls The enemy A.I. can lead to monotonous waits that break immersion and force the horror to dissipate a bit There's no excuse for not including a pause function 8 – The post Routine Review – A Stirring Space Horror appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.869029,Brodie Gibbons,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/pc-reviews/2025/12/13/routine-review-a-stirring-space-horror/,8e641d9bd4ef58524cf8975708de159323b29e0a,1317,en,0.1,"After originally being unveiled at Gamescom thirteen years ago, Routine’s long, drawn-out gestation period has been well-documented.

2025-12-12T00:26:52,Everything Announced At The Game Awards 2025,"Following on from last years event , The Game Awards 2025 wasted no time in getting to the good stuff. From mysterious statues erected in the desert to cheeky and errant tweets, there were a lot of games being shown at Geoff Keighley’s annual wrap-up. Plenty was announced, but a huge shoutout to all of the incredible games that were nominated too. Donkey Kong Bananza , Hades II , Hollow Knight: Silksong , Kingdom Come: Deliverance II , Death Stranding 2 and, of course, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which garnered the most nominations that any game ever has in The Game Awards history. The article below updates live, so refresh it to get the latest as it’s been announced this morning. ALL OF THE GAME AWARDS 2025 ANNOUNCEMENTS A NEW TRAILER FOR RESIDENT EVIL REQUIEM FINALLY REVEALED LEON AND HE’S READY TO ROUNDHOUSE The new trailer introduces Leon, who looks to have more action heavy areas when compared to Grace. The game is still on track for a released at the end of February 2026. REMEDY JUMPED ON STAGE TO ANNOUNCE THEIR NEXT GAME AND ITS A SEQUEL TO CONTROL It’s called Control Resonant and looks to have a whole bunch of changes from the last Control, including taking things out of the Bureau. You play as Jesse’s brother this time, and he looks to be searching for Jesse. It’s out in 2026. THE NEW TOMB RAIDER GAME WAS FINALLY ANNOUNCED The game is called Tomb Raider Catalyst and will take Lara across the globe in another adventure. It’s not quite clear whether this will be in the current Survivor timeline or something entirely new. It’s out in 2027 for PC, Xbox and PlayStation. A REMAKE OF THE FIRST TOMB RAIDER WAS ALSO ANNOUNCED The game is called Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, and it’s out in 2026. The game is a “retelling” of the original game, and is being made by Flying Wild Hog (who previously made the Shadow Warrior games). THE BURNOUT DEVS (KIND OF) ARE WORKING ON A STAR WARS PODRACER GAME The trailer didn’t show much gameplay, at least not in the opening moments as I type this, but it does look pretty solid. It’s called Star Wars: Galactic Racer. THE PRE-SHOW OPENED WITH A LOOK AT A GAME WHERE YOU HERD SHEEP As you’d expect, you play as a dog who is shepherding sheep through what I can only assume is a post-apocalyptic world. It’s out on PS5 and PC in 2027. THE SOULSLIKE GENRE ISN’T DYING ANYTIME SOON WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT It’s called Decrepit and it’s looking very….ominous. Platforms weren’t announced but you can wishlist it on Steam and get ready for a playtest right now. AUDIOMECH GIVES POWER TO MUSIC IN A COOL NEW WAY The game has you channelling your music into different weapons in what I can only assume is a hectic action game. CAPCOM KICKED OFF THEIR NIGHT WITH ANOTHER PRAGMATA TRAILER You control a robot astronaut person and a child robot thing to hack enemies and defeat them with many a weapon. It’s super unique looking and it’s out in April. BRADLEY THE BADGER IS THE BLOODBORNE FOLLOW-UP YOU WANTED (KIND OF) [NOT REALLY] Bringing back 3D platformers in a big way, Bradley The Badger looks to take Bradley to all kinds of locales, including a cheekily named BadgerBorne level. It’s made by one of the directors who worked on the Mario + Rabbids games and even stars Evan Peters. Wow. SOME EX CAPCOM PEEPS HAVE REVEALED THEIR NEW GAME AND IT’S A BANGER It’s a psychedelic action game that is super intriguing, made by people who previously worked at Capcom on Devil May Cry, Resident Evil and Dragon’s Dogma. It has been revealed for PS5 and PC so far and it’s called STUPID NEVER DIES. A BRAND NEW STAR WARS GAME WAS REVEALED AND IT’S FROM A VETERAN STAR WARS DEV TOO It’s directed by Casey Hudson, who directed the Mass Effect games and some of the Knights of the Old Republic games. It’s a single-player action RPG. LARIAN REVEALED THEIR NEXT GAME AND IT’S A RETURN TO THEIR ROOTS The trailer didn’t show any distinct gameplay, but does show off a great amount to help build the world that this new game will take place in. It’s called DIVINITY and it’ll be even bigger and deeper than Baldur’s Gate III. KEIGHLEY GOT JJ ABRAMS ON STAGE TO SHOW OFF A GAME HE HELPED WORK ON The game is described as a combat sandbox in a world that’s written and designed by JJ Abrams amongst many others. There is a playtest coming soon and it’s a multiplayer game, so your mileage may vary. It’s called 4 LOOP and it’s out on PS5 and PC at some point. COVEN OF THE CHICKEN FOOT SOUNDS AS INTERESTING AS YOU THINK The game is a super stylised single-player adventure that has you playing as Gert to build a bond with a creature. The team has worked with Naughty Dog on game previously, so some good talent here. THE AMNESIA AND SOMA DEVS REVEALED THEIR NEW GAME Ewan reckons a Skarsgard is voicing somebody in this one, I’m not so sure (edit: he was right). There were also lots of rats and NPCs, which I’m not sure about either. It’s called Ontos and it’s out in 2026 for all platforms (except Switch, sorry) WE GOT ANOTHER TRAILER FOR EXODUS BUT IT’S FURTHER AWAY THAN I THOUGHT The game is looking super Mass Effect-y and will be hitting consoles in early 2027. WE’RE GETTING ANOTHER DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS GAME BUT HOPEFULLY THIS ONE IS GOOD Honestly nothing can be as bad as that last Dark Alliance game, so I’m on board. The trailer is largely CG but Tricia Helfer is involved and it’s out in 2027. It’s called WARLOCK and it’s a third person, single player adventure game. THE YAKUZA CREATIVES ARE DOING THEIR OWN TAKE ON THE YAKUZA GAMES It’s called Gang of Dragon and it’s bound to scratch the itch of those looking for more Like A Dragon goodness. THE ENTIRETY OF THE STREET FIGHTER FILM CAST TURNED UP ON STAGE TO GIVE US OUR FIRST LOOK AT THE FILM It looks dumb as fuck but I am here for it. THE NEW LEGO BATMAN TRAILER SHOWED OFF SOME MORE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS The game looks fun and pays strong tribute to the franchises’ legacy with a whole bunch of playable characters – it’s releasing on May 29th 2026. THE NEXT DIABLO IV EXPANSION CONTINUES THE STORY OF MEPHISTO It’s called LORD OF HATRED and if you pre-order it today you can play as the new Paladin right now. Dynamic. FOREST 3 LOOKS TO TAKE THINGS IN AN INTERESTING NEW DIRECTION While I’m not completely sure if this is true or not, this looks to be a new game that takes the concept of The Forest and Sons of the Forest into space. LENNY KRAVITZ WAS REVEALED TO BE PLAYING A BAD GUY IN THE NEW BOND GAME The character’s name is Bawma, and he looks to be a self described “pirate king”. The game is still on track for release in March 2026. ORBITALS IS A NEW TWO PLAYER CO-OP GAME EXCLUSIVE TO SWITCH 2 The game is exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2 and described as a 3D co-op adventure with a cel-shaded 80s anime style look. THE NEW LORD OF THE FALLEN TRAILER LOOKS PRETTY JUICY The game looks to be a step up from the first Lords of the Fallen in every way. It’s still on track for a release in 2026. THE NEW SAROS TRAILER SNEAKILY PUSHED THE GAME BACK A MONTH The new trailer shows off some of the other characters that Rahul Kohli’s will interact with in Saros, but also pushed the game back around a month to April. It’s a PlayStation 5 exclusive. THE ASCENT DEVELOPERS NEW GAME LOOKS TO BE SUPER CYBERPUNKY AGAIN BUT THAT’S OK The game is a brand new title from the team who brought us The Ascent. It’s looking just as cyberpunky as The Ascent did, but hopefully does enough differently to stand out. It’s an open-world FPS RPG, so we’re off to the right start. DAVID HARBOUR JUMPED UP ON STAGE TO REVEAL HE IS IN THE NEW WARHAMMER GAME Perhaps this is misleading – it’s a Total War game from Creative Assembly set in the world of Warhammer 40,000. And David Harbour is in it. Stream West End Girl by Lily Allen on Spotify if you haven’t already. xoxo BANDAI NAMCO ANNOUNCED A NEW ACE COMBAT GAME FINALLY It’s out in 2026 and its called ACE COMBAT 8 which is a cool title for an eighth game in a series. THE LATEST PHANTOM BLADE ZERO TRAILER LOOKS HECTIC AS FUCK While it’s easy to think this is a soulslike, this one is apparently more akin to Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry. It’s a long time coming and you’ll have to wait even longer as it’s due out on 9th September 2026. CAPCOM JUMPED BACK ON STAGE TO REVEAL A NEW MEGA MAN IS IN THE WORKS The game returns to the classic 2D style of the many games that have come before it. It’s called Mega Man: Dual Override and it’s out in 2027. HIGHGUARD CLOSED THE SHOW AND IS A NEW SHOOTER FROM SOME EX-APEX LEGENDS DEVS It looks very fantasy tinged and while it’s not for me it at least looks to be doing something differently. It’s out next month, which is nice.

2025-12-10T03:07:33,Magic: The Gathering’s Avatar: The Last Airbender Collection Is Here,"Thanks to Wizards of the Coast, we got our hands on Magic: The Gathering’s latest element bending collaboration set, Avatar: The Last Airbender, to check out all the sweet goodies TCG, Magic and Avatar fans can all get their dopamine hits from. Avatar: The Last Airbender is without a doubt one of pop culture’s most fan-favoured franchises, and when partnered up with one of the biggest TCGs in the four nations, it makes for one fiery card set for collectors and players to sink their teeth into. The new set boasts some amazingly illustrated cards, like Aang – Master of Elements, United Front, and the Field Notes Cards (which are some of my personal favourites), not to mention the variety of Source Material Cards that bring scenes straight from the tv series to our glorious cardboard. New Keyword Actions are also new to this set for players, which very much encompasses the way of the Avatar, with Firebending, Earthbend, Waterbend and Airbend all becoming key components of the games core mechanics. In terms of what we got to check out from the new Avatar: The Last Airbender collection, we received some Play Booster Packs, a Bundle, a Commander’s Bundle as well as some Jumpstart Boosters and Collector Booster Packs. As someone who has dived deeply into the TCG world in the last 18 months (my wallet is no longer speaking to me), but not so much into the world of Magic: The Gathering, the Avatar collection was definitely one to peak my interest when first announced. Now getting my hands on them, I can definitely say from a newcomer’s (and Avatar fan’s) point of view, that these cards are stunning and what I feel like is a great entry point into Magic. Not only this, but opening these cards and bundles is like reliving your first watch through of the TV series – getting eyes on characters and moments reimagined for Magic: The Gathering. Whether you’re a collector and/or player, it’s an enjoyable experience reconnecting with Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko, Uppa and the entire Avatar gang, in a way fans haven’t experienced before. The Standard Bundle we received came with 9 Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Boosters, 5 Traditional Foil and 5 Full-Art Appa Lands, a Alt-Art Traditional Foil Momo Promo, a Card Box and an Oversized Spindown Life Counter. This bundle is a great first step in your journey to mastering the elements. The Art cards are stunning in their foily goodness, with the icing on the cake being the Oversized Life Counter, sporting a little Aang head in replacement of the number 1, as well as the card box itself – showcasing a gorgeous illustration of Fire Lord Ozai heating things up on one side of the box, with the other side portraying Aang in his Avatar state harnessing all four elements. And of course, with the 9 play boosters ready to rip into, you will have the ability to boast 126 cards straight out of the box (plus the Land and Promo cards). The Commander Bundle leans a little more towards those who want to do more than just collect. This bundle includes 9 Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Boosters, 5 Traditional Foil and 5 Full-Art Avatar’s Journey Lands, 2 of 10 Avatar: The Last Airbender Commander’s Fun Cards, Special MTG Avatar versions of Sol Ring, Arcane Signet and Swiftfoot Boots, as well as an Avatar Click Wheel and Card Box. Again, what I love about these bundles is the variety of inclusions you get in a box – all practical to the game. The Commander Bundle I think is one of the best choices for players and collectors, as – obviously – it gives players the cards they need to construct their Commander decks, but for collectors it also brings to life so much Avatar goodness – from the artwork on the Card Box of the Avatar Gang riding Uppa, to the themed clicked wheel, not to mention the full art and foiled cards included in this bundle. It’s definitely one I’d suggest putting at the top of your list if you were still thinking which MTG Avatar product to get. As an Avatar fan, it’s great to see such collaborations like this come to the TCG world. I for one am now hellbent on collecting all the field note cards from this set – I just absolutely love their design and their aesthetic is just on point for Avatar (shown in the photo at the top of this article with ‘Ran and Shaw’ and ‘The Lion-Turtle’ cards). And I think that’s what make this collection work the most – there’s something for everything here, collector, player or just simply an Avatar fan looking for some more ways to connect to the universe. So whether you’re more partial to Airbending over Earthbending, or a passionate Waterbending ready to take on the Fire Nation, Magic: The Gathering’s Avatar: The Last Airbender collection is worth the look at. If you’re a collector then grabbing a few Play or Collector Boosters are a great way to kick off your journey – with the bundles a sure fire way to snag some great cards. For those wanting a little more action with gameplay, you can’t go wrong with the bundles (especially the Commander’s Bundle), and those just starting out, the Jumpstart Booster Packs are the best way to dabble in the world of Magic for the first time. So pack your bags, hitch a ride on Uppa and enjoy the fun that is Magic: The Gathering’s Avatar: The Last Airbender.

2025-12-09T22:47:49,Tekken’s Katsuhiro Harada Is Leaving Bandai Namco,"It looks like it’s the final round for Tekken’s Chief Producer and Game Director, with Katsuhiro Harada announcing on X (formerly Twitter) that he will be stepping down from his role at Bandai Namco, and departing the company. In his post on the 8th of December 2025, coincidentally the last day of Tekken’s 30th Anniversary, Harada announced; “I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.” Harada has been a mainstay of the Tekken series since its early days, cutting his teeth in Namco’s arcade business and voicing the characters of Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu, before stepping into the directors’ seat for Tekken 3. From here, he continued to help the franchise grow and expand, reaching a General Manager position within Bandai Namco while overseeing the Tekken project. “Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.” Tekken’s latest instalment – Tekken 8 – was the first mainline game not to receive an arcade release prior to launch, due to COVID-19 and the changing landscape of the arcade scene in Japan. Tekken 8 managed to surpass 3 million copies faster than its predecessor Tekken 7. Hilariously, Harada’s extensive engagement with the Tekken community on X (formerly Twitter) led to his famous catch phrase “Don’t ask me for shit!” when hounded by fans for not including features or characters in Tekken. While initially borne out of frustration with the fans for being rude, this became incorporated into his appearances, including wearing a shirt during Tekken Talk, and quoting it at The Game Awards when receiving an award for Tekken 8. Harada will still appear as a special guest at the TWT World Finals in 2026. It will definitely be interesting to see where the franchise goes next without a stalwart such as Harada at the helm.

2025-12-08T16:59:40,Skate Story Review – Heart Of Glass,"As a tortured soul, a demon made of nothing but glass and pain, you cut a deal with the Devil: hop on your board, skate through the Emptylands to the Moon, and eat it. It’s a seemingly impossible task, but your skater’s appetite is vast. In terms of set-ups, it doesn’t get more intriguing than Skate Story. Sam Eng’s hellish opus presents the punishing side of street-level skating, where a thirty-something-year-old like me would quite literally shatter like glass upon meeting the pavement. It’s gritty, grounded, and, despite its stunning looks, is perhaps the most honest attempt at the world’s first mainstream “extreme” sport. It might take place within a prismatic playground of kickers, ledges, and rails, but Skate Story manages to ground and spotlight the art of street skateboarding in ways that its contemporaries don’t. In the eyes of hell’s watchful guard, skateboarding is a banned and sinful act, and with no bowls or pipes to be found throughout the layered depths the Devil calls home, vert is nowhere to be found. As such, the game’s primary focus is flips, grinds, and manual work. From a control perspective, Skate Story lands in a mechanic middle ground between Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and Skate; it exhibits the realistic, dangerous side of skateboarding through tests of timing rather than exercises of finicky stick flicking. While skating in Skate Story, you queue up tricks through different combinations of the shoulder buttons, or by setting your feet nearer the front of the deck in a nollie stance. Once queued, a dot begins to snake around a small, windy track for you to perfectly time your skater’s pop. The dot’s cycle speed and position differ based on both how fast you’re moving at the time and the trick itself. The better the timing, the higher the pop is, and I appreciate the developer’s decision not to overcomplicate the game’s controls, or even punish poor timing outright, as Skate Story seems to be as much a synesthaesia experience as it is a skateboarding game. It’s a marriage of beautifully confounding scenes of opaque glass, blooming soul light, cloud and ash, and a thumping, ethereal soundscape courtesy of Blood Cultures. Not since artists, including M.O.O.N. and Scattle, filled the airwaves in Hotline Miami with their pounding electronica has a soundtrack suited a game so well. Blood Cultures brings a lo-fi, psychedelic warmth that perfectly pairs with Skate Story, like a pinot noir to a delicate filet mignon. It’s through their respective indie, experimental approaches that the two complement each other so well. The cut-and-paste, cobbled-together in a wardrobe pop sounds are the perfect backdrop for Skate Story. It’s a wonderful meeting place of reverb and revert. Skate Story is a significantly strange game. It’s abstract, it waxes philosophical as it spouts about heady concepts, and even its level recaps take an almost poetic form. The game’s oddness becomes obvious the second you follow a rabbit through a portal, a clear allusion to Alice’s descent to Wonderland. One second you’re talking with a forgetful frog, you’re then taking lessons from a disembodied statuesque head, all before literally chasing the Devil’s escaped pyjamas. This offbeat nature permeates the objective and level structure, which can feel a bit stop-start as it leaps between what are effectively open parks and quasi-time trial gauntlets where you’re tasked with speeding through gates. One focuses more on the minutiae of footwork and making the board sing, while the other feels like a Red Bull stunt, paying owed dues to the sport’s dangerous side. It’s because it hops so casually between these, while peppering in boss encounters, that the game’s pacing is a tad off-kilter. And in an effort to be this experiential, almost cosmic skateboarding video game, Skate Story’s difficulty never quite matches its thematic and narrative urgency. Each stage might greet you with new things for your trick bag, whether it’s reverts, manuals, or more advanced flip tricks, but you’ll be able to get by on the same old crusty combos you perfected near the start. Absent was the same sense of diminishing returns that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater has, which urges the player to switch up their trick set. It’s because of this that Skate Story feels like a casual rise and grind more than it does a punishing video game about wheeling and dealing with the Devil himself. Unlike its contemporaries, which present from a more traditional from behind vantage point, Skate Story’s low field of vision, which almost mimics a fish-eye lens, albeit without the barrel distortion. Not only does this serve to emulate the iconic photography style seen in skating magazines like Thrasher, but it also thrusts the player in amongst the action and keeps them firmly there. The game’s aforementioned art direction and how it complements the Blood Cultures soundtrack will be quite clearly the game’s big selling point. Although the game’s cold, concrete playground, caked with ash, is something to behold, I do love the skater’s design most of all. Other than the mock Vans on their feet, their appearance as an otherwise featureless glass avatar cuts a striking image. Not only are there a bunch of other decks to collect in-game, including a couple of Devolver-centric ones, which speaks to me as a stan, but there’s also a small customisation suite that comes with your skateboard specifically. You can swap out decks or mix-and-match trucks to combat wear and tear, and cover imperfections with stickers you find throughout the world. It’s minimal, but it’s a nice touch that’s got me eager for a sticker pack merch drop. Skate Story is beautiful, provocative, and arguably the most realistic skateboarding game I’ve played, despite its glassy exterior. With hazards aplenty in the underworld, even the most basic tricks have the potential to usher the skater into a world of hurt. With simple controls that value flair over challenge, however, Skate Story’s trials aren’t quite as trying as its story might suggest. It’s the skateboarder’s equivalent of going well and truly through the looking glass. The PC version of this game was played for the purpose of this review. A digital review code was provided by the publisher. Conclusion Skate Story is a spectacular collision of glass and the most grounded skateboarding I’ve felt in-game. It’s an interesting observation of perseverance in the face of brittle fragility that’s undercut by a need to make its journey palatable, and its stubborn hesitance to push the player closer to their breaking point. As an experiential trip, Skate Story remains a must-play. Positives Great mechanic middle ground between Skate's finicky stick controls and the Tony Hawk arcade style A glorious collision of sound and sight as Blood Cultures delivers an A-grade soundtrack I love the focus and attention given to simple, street level skating Negatives In an effort to be experiential, it fails to challenge the player Mission and objective pacing feels stop-start 8 – The post Skate Story Review – Heart Of Glass appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.930037,Brodie Gibbons,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/pc-reviews/2025/12/09/skate-story-review-heart-of-glass/,0b6e3d98e112961c77e13fc5e5163769bd545eba,1339,en,0.1,"As a tortured soul, a demon made of nothing but glass and pain, you cut a deal with the Devil: hop on your board, skate through the Emptylands to the Moon, and eat it.

2025-12-02T14:59:21,Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Review – Primed For Excellence,"As every day passed and every trailer released, you’d be forgiven for being concerned about Metroid Prime 4. Firstly, it’s been almost two decades since the last game, and the genre that Metroid has inspired has since become quite saturated. It didn’t help that all the pre-release media for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond shows it in a different light than we’ve come to expect from Metroid. Thankfully, now that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is here, I’m happy to report that this is the Metroid Prime follow-up that fans have been clamouring for since the original game released . Such a statement, however, is not without its caveats. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond opens with a bang, in a similar fashion to Metroid Prime 3. Samus joins the Galactic Federation against the invading forces of Sylux, a bounty hunter from the previous games who has an odd control of the Metroids. During their face-off, an artefact is activated, transporting everything in the base (and parts of the base itself) to Viewros. A previously undiscovered planet, Viewros was once inhabited by an alien race called the Lamorn. Helping Samus, thinking her to be “the chosen one”, the Lamorn send Samus after keys that’ll help her return to her world. While you don’t need to play previous games in the series to appreciate what’s happening in Beyond, I’ll just come out and say it. The plot in Beyond is largely disappointing. While there are two key storylines here that slowly unravel themselves to the player – one about Sylux, and the other about the Lamorn – almost all of the details are drip-fed to you in a way that remains intriguing. It’s unfortunate, then, that none of these threads come together satisfyingly. While there are more details elaborated upon in the full completion endings, the base experience is too vague to be of value and will leave most players with questions. Thankfully, the gameplay remains as strong as ever. Metroid Prime 4 does little to evolve the formula established by the original trilogy almost two decades ago. While this is usually construed as a negative, it is not – it’s a testament to the uniqueness of the Prime games that this formula can exist so many years on and still be compelling. While other Metroidvanias exist, none hit on the same level as the Prime games. Beyond follows that tradition. It is a much more honed realisation of all the potential of both Metroid Prime 2 and Metroid Prime 3, exploring (marginal) new ground while keeping things familiar to the core of the franchise. Such a core is the same as in previous Metroid games. Samus is thrown into a weird, alien world to explore, defeating enemies and bosses and collecting power-ups that often let her delve even deeper. It’s an experience typical of this genre, and is both familiar and comforting. Fans will no doubt revel in developer Retro’s willingness to stick to what works. At the same time, series newcomers will find novelty in this semi-open-world experience that has been largely unexplored, both literally and figuratively, for so long. But not everything in Metroid Prime 4 is entirely familiar. The most dramatic difference is the introduction of Vi-O-La, a cybernetic bike built by the Lamorn that Samus can use for both traversal and combat. You will mostly use Vi-O-La to travel large distances across the Sol Valley, a vast desert that connects the game’s five areas. It can also be utilised in these areas at specific times, but is mostly used in Sol Valley. Overall, the implementation of Vi-O-La is pretty well done, and while the game’s marketing has insisted that its gameplay is grounded in heroically geared action, it’s the opposite. Sol Valley and its implementation will be among the most contentious aspects of Metroid Prime 4. It’s a barren open world, peppered with only a handful of points of interest, occupying a space similar to that of open worlds like the Great Sea from Zelda’s Wind Waker. There are structures to explore, power-ups to unearth and even shrines with optional power-ups to uncover. It’s nothing too exhaustive nor overbearing, and is an approach I much prefer to Ubisoft’s overwhelming open-world approach . The Sol Valley is built in a way that’s just distracting enough – I almost always spent more time exploring in the valley when travelling instead of just moving from one point to another. But what will go much unnoticed, especially by those who don’t play it, is the way that the Sol Valley feeds into that sense of isolation that Metroid players absolutely clamour for. It’s a locale that feels huge and expansive, making you feel tiny as you explore this alien planet. The quiet, eerie music that plays while you explore it fits perfectly with this notion. Yes, there is some combat in the desert, but it feels more like a clever, light distraction that takes the edge off the tedium of backtracking. And while backtracking makes up a majority of Metroid Prime 4, it’s nowhere near as egregious as in the previous games and contributes to the world’s great sense of interconnectedness. Every location you visit in Beyond is visited at least twice during the main story, though there are more times in which you can visit as you unlock new abilities. There is a mandatory fetch quest at the end, as is customary with all the Prime games, but this one isn’t as obnoxious as those presented in Prime 2. It doesn’t bring the story or the pacing to a screeching halt, and you can start working on it fairly early on if you’re an astute explorer. THE CHEAPEST PRICE: $89 WITH FREE SHIPPING FROM AMAZON Each of the locations you explore will be familiar to series fans – though Beyond does its best to twist them in a way to make them feel unique enough. There is a good mix of the loud and heroic tones of the earlier Metroid games and the quieter and more atmospheric tones you commonly associate with the series. There are definitely some areas that are stronger than others – the Ice Belt is easily a massive highlight for me, but I can never turn down an opportunity to explore an abandoned lab and be subjected to a deep lore dump. The other, more contentious aspect of Metroid Prime 4 is easily the presence of the soldiers who accompany Samus on her journey. Each of these characters will usually introduce themselves to Samus at the beginning of each area before backing off and letting Samus do her thing. There are some times during the story where they accompany Samus in the more action-heavy setpieces, but they generally do not bother you for more than fifteen minutes. That sense of isolation that people crave from Metroid is still here in Beyond, striking a strong balance between the style of 2 and 3, but not resembling either entirely. On the topic of collectibles, Samus’ new abilities and powers are unfortunately not all that new. For the most part, the introduction of “Psychic” abilities in Viewros offers new spins on already existing skills for Samus. It’s an interesting approach that, like the rest of Beyond, doesn’t quite reinvent the wheel, but instead reinterprets it. The result is something marginally fresh – and while the Psychic abilities are mainly used for exploration, you can mix them with combat abilities to gain the upper hand if you so wish (though admittedly I never felt the need to do so). Though the bosses you encounter in Beyond are some of the strongest in the series. Like the rest of the game, each of them could’ve been lifted from the previous games, offering slight new twists that require you to use Samus’ powers effectively. Many of these battles form the most difficult and memorable moments of the game, but the count does feel a little low, and I’d have loved to fight more of them. Still, this is definitely a quality-over-quantity situation, especially compared to Prime 2 and 3, but it’s worth mentioning. That’s not to say that Beyond will short-change you. Anything but. The whole adventure will take most players between twelve and fifteen hours to complete, though you can easily stretch that out to more if you want to explore and find everything. There is a hard mode unlocked after finishing the game once, as well as unlockable artwork tied to certain items and scan percentages. But while these are nice additions, the more interesting backstory for the game is locked behind completing the game 100% (or an amiibo), which is relatively disappointing. There is also no way to go back and explore the world once you finish, which was normal for the old games but feels like a misstep today. Though there are no missteps in Beyond’s presentation, which is simply first-class. One of the best-looking games that Nintendo has published, Beyond is truly a looker. Much has already been said about the display options, but it’s encouraging to report that both run admirably on the Switch 2 hardware. But this dedication to presentation isn’t just technical – it has a strong artistic aspect too. Bringing together this strong technical prowess with even stronger artistic design helps to create a world that feels alive. There is truly nothing like exploring an alien world in a Metroid Prime game, and Beyond delivers on that in droves. I can’t tell you how many times these little moments, like walking through a snowy tundra and seeing frost and condensation gather on Samus’ cannon, helped immerse me in a world that felt alive and breathing. It’s a level of fidelity that we’re not used to seeing from Nintendo, and one that really sets Beyond apart from their other games. Combine this with a soundtrack that sounds like it’s lifted from the previous games, and you’ve got a genuine and authentic Metroid Prime experience in Beyond. And that’s really the simplest takeaway I can make from Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. It feels like an authentic Metroid Prime experience in every way, without sacrificing the identity of the games that helped forge its legacy so many years ago. While there are some missteps, particularly with its story that goes almost nowhere, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is well beyond what any fan could have hoped for, and a step in the right direction for the Metroid series. Conclusion Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn't a reinvention, but instead a pleasant reminder of all the things that made Metroid Prime back over the last few decades. It's a satisfying return to the formula that made Prime so strong many years ago - including some great boss encounters, rewarding and satisfying exploration and presentation that is quite frankly Nintendo's best. While the story doesn't quite land, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is a stellar sc-fi adventure for Samus and more than worthy of the Prime name. Positives Incredible presentation and atmosphere Satisfying exploration and backtracking Simple but clever twists on existing abilities Negatives Unsatisfying storyline and resolution Boss counts feels a bit low 9 THE CHEAPEST PRICE $89 FROM AMAZON – The post Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Review – Primed For Excellence appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.947397,James Berich,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-reviews/2025/12/03/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-primed-for-excellence/,c9445c5e7291311c01d78600e4798478a99b8fa2,1343,en,0.1,"As every day passed and every trailer released, you’d be forgiven for being concerned about Metroid Prime 4.

2025-12-01T23:52:30,New Grand Theft Auto 6 Animations Have Seemingly Appeared Online,"A Reddit user has spotted a showreel from an animator who has worked for Rockstar Games for some times, and within the showreel is seemingly animations for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6. The video has now been taken offline, but is featured below (or here) and shows off two scenes that are seemingly from Grand Theft Auto 6. The first shows a character taking a bike from a rental stand and then returning the bike to the stand in great detail. This one is pretty significant as in addition to seeing the animation, it seemingly confirms rental bikes in Grand Theft Auto 6. The second video shows a female character (seemingly protagonist Lucia) getting off a pickup truck and working her way around it in great detail, which again, shows off some seemingly impressive animations. Otherwise in the showreel are cuts from Red Dead Redemption 2, Max Payne 3 as well as Grand Theft Auto 5. Grand Theft Auto 6 is set to release on November 19th, 2026 after being delayed with Rockstar citing that it would need “additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve” The post New Grand Theft Auto 6 Animations Have Seemingly Appeared Online appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.957812,Shannon Grixti,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2025/12/02/new-grand-theft-auto-6-animations-have-seemingly-appeared-online/,e2c0a61ba250b2c4bc7229ae584fc8a1f00899d2,1344,en,0.1,"A Reddit user has spotted a showreel from an animator who has worked for Rockstar Games for some times, and within the showreel is seemingly animations for the upcoming Grand Theft",other,0.25

2025-11-21T00:29:29,Everything Announced At The November 2025 Xbox Partner Preview,"This morning’s Xbox Partner Preview showcased a breadth of third-party partnerships, from small content drops, ports, stealth releases, and world premiere announcements. The 30-minute showcase featured titles from IO Interactive, THQ Nordic, and Poncle. Along with a few surprise “and it’s out today” drops for Xbox Game Pass, it was reiterated throughout that all of the titles shown would support Play Anywhere, which is certain to be a boon for anyone running a handheld PC, Xbox ROG Ally X, or not. Here’s a rundown of everything shown off during today’s Xbox Partner Preview. Bond’s Got A Flash New Set of Wheels For 007 First Light James Bond is synonymous with the latest in cutting-edge technology, and he’s also synonymous with hot cars, even going so far as to blend the two on regular occasions. This brief trailer highlights the Aston Martin Valhalla, a gorgeous coupe worthy of any 00 agent’s license to thrill. Armatus Is The New Action Roguelite From The Team Behind Godfall While Godfall breezed right by the mark for most people, this new title trades in the swords and glistening armour for a gothic horror flavour. It’s launching next year and will be on Game Pass at launch. Blow Up The Pokies! CloverPit Is Out Today, And It’s On Game Pass Branded one of the year’s most addictive roguelikes, CloverPit’s loop is to slot machines what Balatro is to poker. Enough said, play it. Crowsworn Is A Stylish Metroidvania With A Focus On Fluid Combat Although no release window was given for this one, it’s rocketed up my most anticipated list as a passionate lover of Metroidvania titles. I’ll make it a personal goal to save Fearanndal, if it’s the last thing I do. The Donkey Kong-like minecart levels are a plus, too. Dave The Diver Dives Into Xbox’s Briny Depths Today One of the most popular indie-not-indie games of the last few years has, at last, made its way onto Xbox alongside a new expansion, titled In The Jungle, which lets you do battle with giant crocs that’d have Bob Irwin’s eyes watering. Echo Generation 2 Looks To Be Bringing Even Stranger Things To Players I do love how much this game wears its 80s and 90s popcorn horror inspirations on its sleeve; there are even nods to Gremlins, which is bound to be lost on your ‘6-7’ crowd. Erosion Promises A Rapidly Aging Western World, And That’s Cool As Heck Similar to Sifu, which saw your character age out of his own story if he died too often, Erosion’s world advances a decade every time you die, creating an urgency to unravel the narrative conceit before it’s too late. It’s a rad concept, and we’re here for it. Hitman’s Next Elusive Target Is Slim Shady Himself The catch, however, is that in Hitman’s world, Marshall Mathers’ alter ego, Slim Shady, split off into a separate, ultraviolent entity, and it’s Eminem himself that’s tasked you with eliminating his other self. He’s truly about to lose himself.  You can whack Slim off on December 1. The Mound: Omen of Cthulu Lets You Take On Eldritch Nightmares With A Bud And thank goodness, too. Cosmic horror can be pant-shittingly scary, and I think having a friend tag along would help the situation. Quite obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, I’m ready to have my perception tested when it launches next year. Raji: Kaliyuga Is A Bold Step Up On Its Predecessor Set six years after the original game, Raji’s sequel delves into the mystical, portraying wars between mortals and gods. While the original game was a simpler, isometric action game, this follow-up makes the full jump to third-person action, and it looks gorgeous. Reanimal’s Release Date Got Revealed, And You Can Play It Now From the creators of Little Nightmares, Reanimal follows a brother and sister who face unspeakable horrors while trying to escape from their own home with their friends in tow. Its atmosphere is irresistible, it’s coming in February next year, and there’s a demo you can play right now. Roadside Research Is A Comedic Co-Op Game About Aliens In A Petrol Station Now this one sounds fun. Along with a friend, you try to blend in as extraterrestrials running a petrol station, from stocking shelves and trying to look normal, all while gathering intel on the human race. It’s out early next year and will be on Game Pass. Tides Of Annihilation Shows Off A Mammoth Boss Battle In Its New Trailer Resisting the urge to hit another standard marketing beat, Tides of Annihilation decided just to put out gameplay footage of one of the game’s huge boss battles to capture your attention. Bold strategy, Cotton. Total Chaos Is Another “Out Today” Stealth Drop For Xbox Game Pass Speaking of pant-shitting, I think Total Chaos has potential to eke a bit of uh, concern out of me. It’s an atmospheric survival-horror first-person shooter where you’re having to scramble to cobble guns together while avoiding just the most horrible nightmare fuel. Best of all, it’s out today. Poncle’s New Vampire Survivors Game Is A Dungeon Crawler Vampire Crawlers, a brand new deck-builder, dungeon-crawling roguelike, is Poncle’s new title, and it features the trademark chaos and moreish replayability of its predecessor. Bibles, whips, and garlic aplenty. Zoopunk Is A Frenetic Action Game Within The F.I.S.T. Universe From the creators of F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch, this acrobatic, explosive action game features anthropomorphic woodland cuddlies, and if there’s one thing I love, it’s a rabbit acting like a grizzled war vet. Expected to release in 2027, this one is a long way out.

2025-11-19T10:59:59,Kirby Air Riders Review – Puts The Air In Flair,"When Nintendo revealed Kirby Air Riders for the Nintendo Switch 2 , many questioned why a racer would come so soon after what was seemingly Nintendo’s flagship, Mario Kart World . I was one of those people. At their core, both games are racers, but really, in the same way that Call of Duty and BioShock are both shooters. Kirby Air Riders is a fundamentally different racer to Mario Kart World and, though I didn’t care for Kirby Air Ride (or even Mario Kart World), Kirby Air Riders is far and away my favourite racing game on both the Switch and Switch 2 and well worth your time. Surprisingly, the plot in Kirby Air Riders not only exists, but it’s also pretty intriguing. It’s by no means an enthralling piece of narrative drenched in character drama, but it is beyond anything you’d expect. Experienced through the game’s single player mode, called Road Trip, it tells an epic tale of cosmic warfare. There’s not a lot of crazy twists or turns, but it serves as a great backdrop for why all of these cute little characters are riding around on strange new machines. The production quality is similarly incredible, surpassing anything you’d expect, and feels like something we haven’t seen from Nintendo since The Subspace Emissary in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, all the way back in 2008. But to understand how Road Trip works, you have to know how Kirby Air Riders works. There are four major modes available when you boot the game – Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial and Road Trip. Mechanically, the game has not changed much from its first iteration on the Gamecube in 2003. You still use a single button to accelerate and activate abilities. It sounds bizarre at first – a racer in which you use a single button to do everything – but it surprisingly works. When you master Air Riders, it is somehow much more mechanically satisfying and is deceptively complex in its execution compared to other kart racers. While a single button controls most of your actions in Kirby Air Riders, it somehow works. You automatically accelerate at a pace determined by your vehicle, holding down a button to slow down. Doing it for long enough brakes you completely, while releasing it at the right time will give you a short boost. The “meta” of Kirby Air Riders, then, is to work out the right time to lose speed to gain some. And once you get your head around the fact that this is really all you have to think about, it’s a bizarrely freeing feeling that allows you to focus on the things that matter – maintaining and building speed. Once you’ve mastered the controls, either through tutorials or by winging it, you can jump into any mode at your leisure. Air Ride is your fairly typical selection of racing games – you can take part in a typical lap-based race, play a set time trial mode, or even infinitely loop each track in a kind of “free roam” mode. Each of the courses you’ll encounter in this mode is cleverly designed and well beyond what you’d expect, featuring some really gnarly loops and crazy trips through constantly shifting worlds. The power of the Switch 2 is being used here to offer up a racing experience that’s frenetic and hectic, much like recently released Sonic Racing: Crossworlds . While I must commend the team for ensuring that nothing from the previous game was left behind, Top Ride is easily my least favourite mode, but it is still enjoyable. In Top Ride, players race around a course from a top-down perspective. It features its own unique set of tracks and uses the same mechanics as the rest of the game. It’s a nice inclusion and bound to be a better choice for those who find the traditional Air Rides overwhelming, but it’s too simplistic for me to keep coming back to. City Trial is my favourite, offering up a bizarre PvPvE experience for up to sixteen players. You and the other players are thrust onto a City map, and must collect power-ups and vehicles to prepare yourself for a Stadium minigame at the end of each round. It’s easily where Air Riders gets the most intense, and it’s easily my highlight of the package. Playing it with a group of people in the same room is an enjoyable experience, which is only compounded when the game is constantly throwing batshit world events at you. Spawning a boss to defeat, raining explosives, or even just creating a short race for everyone to complete, it’s a cool experience that significantly evolves the formula seen in the original game. THE CHEAPEST PRICE: $89 WITH FREE SHIPPING FROM AMAZON At the end of every City Trial is a Stadium minigame – some are simple races, while others are fun and quick objective-based minigames. There are over fifteen different Stadium minigames to play in City Trials, and you can even play them separately if you have some favourites. All in all, City Trial and the Stadium games attached to it are easily my personal highlight from the package, though I’d have loved if there were one or two more city maps available, just to keep things varied and fresh. All of these modes, options and minigames come together rather elegantly in the Road Trip mode, which is the core solo experience in Kirby Air Riders. In this mode, you ride along many different roads, choosing your path through the story with a bunch of encounters built from the blocks that Kirby Air Riders is made of. Think of it as a combination of the encounters from the Spirit Battles and World of Light of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , with the narrative ambitions of The Subspace Emissary from Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  Even better, there’s a tonne to unlock, and the story is infinitely replayable if you want to see the entirety of this bizarre story. Of course, this is all bolstered by a strong roster full of a veritable who’s who of the Kirby universe. Each character can be paired with a unique machine, which, when paired with unique abilities, leads to some pretty interesting match-ups. It feels a lot more considered than other kart racers, where the only difference between characters is cosmetic, and vehicles are just stat differences. Instead, every vehicle and rider in Kirby Air Riders has skills unique to them. It’s a shame, though, that you have to unlock most of them, which can be frustrating if you want to play this straight away with your mates. Though it’s worth noting just how robust the multiplayer options are for Kirby Air Riders. There is plenty of flexibility here in how you play it – every mode is playable with up to four players, besides Road Trip – and performance barely falters when you’re playing locally. For the most part, the multiplayer remains at 60 frames per second, although during some of the more intense events of City Trial, there is a slight slowdown, but nothing dramatic. Regardless, the bottom line is that Kirby Air Riders, whether played solo or with friends, doesn’t feel like a compromised experience when playing splitscreen. However, this certainly raises the question of whether Kirby Air Riders is better played solo or with friends. On one hand, Road Trip mode is delightfully moreish, constructed from such an intense variety of activities served to you at such a brisk pace that you’ll struggle to put it down. But with friends, Kirby Air Riders really does shine too, especially in the same room. I can’t begin to tell you how much my friends and I found joy and laughed at the insane situations we found ourselves in, and that’s definitely worth mentioning. In short, Kirby Air Riders is good for solo players, but even better in groups. But while its appeal is not as immediately obvious when compared to Mario Kart, its deceptively complex systems grounded in a simple control scheme easily make it stand out from the pack. Though make no mistakes, while Kirby Air Riders is borrowing a lot of visual flourishes from director Masahiro Sakurai’s other baby, Super Smash Bros., Kirby Air Riders is easily Kirby looking at his absolute best.  The sheer variety of colours and styles in the world design, coupled with some cute and vibrant animations, helps to bring this bizarre realm to life in a way that Kirby hasn’t before. It’s an incredibly nice-looking game, and this is only compounded by the game’s performance, which runs at a buttery smooth sixty frames per second almost always. Similarly, the soundtrack is also great, featuring epic orchestral themes that lend every race a sense of dramatic intensity that you don’t get in other racers. When all is said and done, people will still probably compare Kirby Air Riders to Mario Kart World, and I wouldn’t blame them. I’ve no doubt drawn some comparisons here already. However, while its core fundamentals are similar, Kirby Air Riders is a truly unique and enjoyable experience that stands out from any racer I’ve played before. It’s an interesting little redux that finally makes good on the promises laid bare by Kirby Air Ride on the Gamecube, and a successful sequel in practically every way. Conclusion Kirby Air Riders delivers a distinct and fast-paced spin on the racing genre that is about so much more than just reaching the finish line. The unexpectedly offbeat story mode, clever course design, and surprisingly tense yet frenetic competitive play all come together to offer a well-rounded package full of joy and charm. While City Trial could use a few more maps, and the stop-start mechanics aren't immediately engaging, Kirby Air Riders is incredible fun, no matter how you play it or who you play it with. Positives Unique, deceptively deep one-button racing Road Trip is surprisingly addictive and replayable Plenty of robust and uncompromised multiplayer options Negatives City Trial could use some more maps Top Ride is a smidge too simple Unlockables may frustrate players looking to jump in with friends 8.5 THE CHEAPEST PRICE $89 FROM AMAZON – The post Kirby Air Riders Review – Puts The Air In Flair appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.991043,James Berich,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-reviews/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-putting-the-air-in-flair/,45632449d8e030823fe83fc51130d6beec34418f,1359,en,0.1,"When Nintendo revealed Kirby Air Riders for the Nintendo Switch 2 , many questioned why a racer would come so soon after what was seemingly Nintendo’s flagship, Mario Kart World .

2025-11-19T04:45:15,Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Review – Rocks The Cradle,"Variety has long been part of Call of Duty’s strength. Not confined to a single historical era or idea, their single-player campaigns have woven with ease between grounded, gritty geopolitical thrillers and sci-fi silliness. Courtesy to the cinematic standard Modern Warfare, and Black Ops especially, have achieved over the last two decades, this reality-hopping series has never, ever felt off-kilter; however, Black Ops 7, the latest in this ‘every other year’ sub-series, ventures beneath the bar set by all prior Call of Duty games, delivering on a campaign that feels like a complete and total abandonment of what campaign players look for most in favour of embracing the franchise’s multiplayer ideologies. For a series built on intrigue and unexpected, mind-fucking twists, Black Ops 7 plays a rather straight bat in terms of the story it tells. As Alex Mason’s son, David, you start by investigating the apparent re-emergence of terrorist Raul Menendez, who’d died years earlier at David’s hands. This is soon debunked to be a deepfake red herring and really doesn’t meaningfully evolve from there as David’s squad is terrorised by The Guild’s experimental, mind-altering neurotoxin, rendering the story nonsensical, disjointed, and clinging desperately to the series’ history. The iconic uprising of Vorkuta, a powerful act of defiance, is reduced to a cheap facsimile, a sort of close enough rendition slapped in for nostalgia’s sake. The franchise’s usual globetrotting remains, but it means less than ever, with not even a shred of sinew connecting things. Kiernan Shipka’s unambiguous villain, Emma Kagan, is one-geared and fails to deliver the swerves we’d expect from a Black Ops story. It pains me to say, but, like the points in Whose Line, this story doesn’t matter. As someone who’d often play Call of Duty for its campaign, I’d often see it as the finer cut of steak next to the chuck beef that is Zombies. But that, in itself, has been the series’ strength, where else could you get three packaged in experiences that all cater to particular audiences. A term I know I bandied around in years gone by is “bang for buck,” and with this being the most homogeneous Call of Duty perhaps ever, where its multiplayer pillars are woven through every aspect of the game, it has become little more than a thoughtless shooting gallery. Built specifically for four-player co-op, it feels like Activision’s fashionably late swing at Borderlands. Things like health bars, weapon grades, and typical, behemoth bosses, who appear from the torso up at the arena’s edge and spew deathbeams at you, aren’t things I ever expected to see in a Black Ops campaign. I won’t say it’s an experience totally devoid of fun; I found flashes of it once I came to terms with what it was trying to be. It helps that the gunplay is still as tight as ever despite being pigeon-holed into ranged conflict by the game’s pointlessly large sandboxes, which, to their credit, do make the locomotion, via both wingsuit and omnidirectional movement, a joy. Despite being built with co-op in mind, the campaign can be played solo; however, I wouldn’t recommend it. Not only is it less fun because the cross-map commutes feel longer, and the enemies seem spongier, but the required online connection leads to many of the unavoidable pitfalls of online play. Despite being in your own private instance, you’re unable to pause, and the game doesn’t checkpoint, so if you need to step away to run an errand, you’re practically kissing that progress goodbye. One thing I don’t mind at all about Black Ops 7 feeling like one big, multiplayer-first, unified platform is the global progression system available across all modes. Being around thirty levels in at the closure of the story, ready to hop into online with a reasonable loadout is, I feel, a plus. THE CHEAPEST PRICE: $89 WITH FREE SHIPPING Once the curtain falls on the game’s campaign, you’re able to embark on the ‘Endgame’. The mode, which is billed as a PVE extraction mode, serves as an epilogue of sorts, allowing players to buggerise about and work together within this big Avalon sandbox. Despite not spending an enormous amount of time there yet, I can see the thought process in a world where these games are all the rage. I do think not having any kind of player-on-player engagement is a mistake, as it kind of robs the player’s ability to craft and roleplay those fun kinds of conflict and betrayal. As someone who wasn’t particularly impressed by Avalon itself, from a layout and points of interest perspective, I do hope they manage to grow or alter the map in the coming seasons. Considering the surreal places this narrative goes, it’s fair to say that the figurative leash of the art department was given significant slack. In that sense, at least half of the campaign is perhaps the deepest dive into the sci-fi realm we’ve seen from a Black Ops, which has often ventured into weird territory. Sadly, nothing else in the game, especially anything to do with The Guild, exceeds vanilla levels of intrigue. Whether it’s a by-product of lag or data-streaming, I was also perplexed by how ordinary some of the animation was. For a developer whose production values are industry leading, to see how comically rigid and obviously on-rails the VTOL’s flight path was made me laugh out loud. As someone who likes his Call of Duty to be cinematic, thrilling, and high-stakes, I’m not sure that any moment of Black Ops 7 managed to achieve any of that. The direction it takes, and how it so regularly cheapens its own legacy, has me hopeful they’ll leave their return to this canon in a future far, far away. The Xbox Series X version of this game was played for the purpose of this review. Conclusion Black Ops 7 is, without question, the most disappointed I’ve been in a Call of Duty campaign. It’s not because it’s the least fun, necessarily, it’s because it’s a regression in every field that Black Ops excels—it’s a thoughtless, homogeneous mess that feels more like a Zombies off-shoot that, in an attempt to call back to better games, only serves to cheapen their memory. Positives I like the global progression system they've put in place The gunplay and locomotion still feels like standard Call of Duty Endgame is an interesting enough little gambit Negatives The story is tripe The always online pitfalls are frustrating for solo players The mission and level structure is poor when compared to more cinematic entries in the series 5.5 – The post Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Review – Rocks The Cradle appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:54.994019,Brodie Gibbons,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2025/11/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review-rocks-the-cradle/,70a1d8cb8cfd8b6674392cd438ee80be4428faa2,1360,en,0.1,"Variety has long been part of Call of Duty’s strength.

2025-11-18T05:38:13,The New PS5 Slim Model Has Arrived In Australia With Less Storage And An All Matte Design,"UPDATE : The new Digital PS5 Slim has now arrived in Australia with its lesser 825GB of storage and all matte design and is listed on Amazon , EB Games and JB Hi-Fi . It’s the same price at $749.95 but will be significantly discounted later this week (to $500 and below). ORIGINAL STORY: A new Digital PS5 Slim Model is rolling out to all territories with some significant changes, and YouTuber Austin Evans has got his hands on a model. Whilst this isn’t an update that is being publicized and will seemingly come in at the same price, there are external and internal changes to the new model. The largest one externally is the fact that instead of the top portion being glossy and the bottom matte, the PS5 Slim now has all matte faceplates. The original PS5 Slim SSD was upgraded to 1TB (from 825GB on the original PS5) but that has once again been downgraded to 825GB. The new PS5 Slim is also about 120 grams lighter due to a redesigned heat sink structure made of thinner metal, although this doesn’t seem to have an impact on the power consumption or temperature that the console operates at. This new model has already rolled out in Europe, and whilst there are no reports of it arriving in Australia yet (we normally get new PS5 models first), it can’t be long before this starts replacing the current 1TB Slim. If you’re wanting a PS5 Slim 1TB, it’s currently down to $699 on Amazon ($130 off), so it’s actually a good time to jump in and grab one.

2025-11-17T14:00:22,Marvel’s Deadpool VR Review – Virtual Absurdity,"While almost all superheroes are inherently ripe for virtual reality experiences, few are as instantly fitting as Deadpool. Thanks to his wanton violence, frequent fourth-wall breaks, and trademark absurdity, stepping into the boots of the merc with a mouth is a no-brainer. It’s taken a while to get here, but Twisted Pixel Games has captured the essence of Deadpool effortlessly, despite some shortcomings. Marvel’s Deadpool VR starts like any other day for the titular Deadpool – a routine contract from S.H.I.E.L.D to take down Flag-Smasher. Through an unexpected turn of events, though, Deadpool is whisked away to Mojoworld and enlisted by Mojo to kidnap villains for his violent reality TV show. The show in question pits forces from across the universe in a fight to the death, with Mojo also insisting that Deadpool partakes in the carnage. This main plot point doesn’t develop much until the final act of the game, mainly serving as an excuse to send Deadpool all over the Marvel universe to do battle with iconic baddies. It leans heavily into fan service, but it feels on-brand for Deadpool, who’s constantly poking fun at the situations he finds himself in. While the ending is also somewhat predictable, it’s delivered in such an endearing and confident fashion that I couldn’t help but smile. How much mileage you get out of this narrative overall is really going to come down to how much you like Deadpool’s overall schtick – specifically in the most recent movies. He’s constantly dropping pop culture references, cracking crude jokes, and spewing sexual innuendo like his life depends on it. It is genuinely funny, especially when it’s making fun of or referencing other games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Vanquish , but if you don’t like recent interpretations of this character, don’t expect this iteration of Deadpool to surprise you. Much of this is due to the performance of Neil Patrick Harris as Deadpool, who often feels like he isn’t trying to do much more than his best impersonation of Ryan Reynolds. It’s by no means a bad performance, but it lacks any real identity or charisma that Reynolds hasn’t already imbued into the character over the years. It was always going to be difficult given how synonymous Reynolds is with the character, but it leaves Harris’s casting feel like he was the next best option and not the number one choice. Regardless of how you might feel about this version of Deadpool, there’s no denying that Marvel’s Deadpool VR is a ridiculously fun VR experience. Much like last year’s Batman: Arkham Shadow , this is a fully fleshed-out title, with a full-length campaign, flexible combat system, and jaw-dropping set pieces unlike anything else I’ve experienced in VR. You can tell that Twisted Pixel Games had a lot of fun dipping into this universe. For starters, it’s just so novel to take control of Deadpool like this. His healing factor becomes a recurring comedic bit both in and outside of combat. Deadpool’s arms can be dismembered when you take damage, limiting your ability to dual-wield, but also providing you with the opportunity to hurl limbs at unsuspecting foes. Twisted Pixel Games also leans into the healing factor in cutscenes, often decapitating Deadpool in moments of pure hilarity as his lower half moves independently. And make no mistake – all of these bits grow back with all the wet squelching you could want. The slapstick improvisational nature of Deadpool deeply influences combat as well. At base, you have dual katanas and dual pistols that you can mix and match, alongside a grapple gun you unlock early on the game. Katanas and pistols can be thrown at enemies, each to different effect. While katanas will lodge and stick inside your adversaries, they can also send them careening into the environment and pinning them against walls. Your pistols, on the other hand, will bounce off a target and automatically reload. Deadpool also has a ridiculously fun dive kick that can send enemies flying, execute them if on low health, or use them as a springboard that you can kick off of for a bit of slow-motion air time to unload rounds in stylish fashion. Combine all of this with the aforementioned grapple gun that can sling enemies in all directions – including the ability to bounce them off of the floor – and your left with a combat system that encourages and rewards experimentation ala Bulletstorm. Scoring unique kills will entertain Mojo’s audience, improving your overall performance in combat and the level at large. Creative dispatches will also fill the Big Money Time gauge, which can be used as a sort of superweapon in combat to make quick work of foes. There’s a couple of different Big Money Time weapons, but the undisputed highlight is a Mjolnir-like hammer that can be thrown and recalled while also obliterating anything unfortunate to stand within melee range. There’s also so many customisation options. Marvel’s Deadpool VR is positively flush with unlockable upgrades and cosmetics. You can snag variants for your katanas and pistols that change their behaviours. You can get pistols with penetrating rounds and laser sights, machine pistols that do less damage but fire faster, or katanas that reflect enemy projectiles when you block. There’s a healthy amount Deadpool variants to unlock and play us that also allow you to unlock secrets throughout the main levels. I’ve also never played a VR game this densely packed with totally absurd set pieces and boss fights. The very first mission opens with a breakneck car chase that sees you shooting down goons at highspeed, culminating in an eventful crash onto a helicarrier. Boss fights are similarly high-octane, complete with multiple phases, inobtrusive yet satisfying quick-time-events, and some utterly brilliant cameos that make for some great character dynamics. Between these main missions where you recruit villains for Mojo, you’ll actually take place in the games. These are short and sweet distractions from the larger levels and serve as a nice pace-breaker from all the action. Unfortunately, they aren’t all built equal and lose some of the lustre by the time credits roll. They’re fun overall, but they aren’t something I’ll be itching to replay like I will be with the core missions. The core conceit of this story is what ultimately allows Marvel’s Deadpool VR to take place in so many different locations across the Marvel universe. There’s a smorgasbord of locations you’ll explore here, from an abandoned Nova Corps ship to Mephisto’s very own pocket dimension. There’s so much to see and do within each of these levels, each bringing their own enemy types and unique level mechanics that strengthen the identity of each venture. They’re really sold through fantastic visuals and an art style that feels like a comic book brought to life. Some soft cel shading and careful attention to detail makes each biome a joy to explore and it leaves the whole experience feeling quite separate from Marvel’s recent video game works which have tended to lean a bit more into realistic art direction. Performance does leave a bit to be desired, though. Frame rates frequently buckle under the weight of chaotic encounters which can lead to some uncomfortable moments in VR. The game also feels like it needs one final round of polish, with a few noticeable bugs popping up from time to time pertaining to audio and user interface, some of which required full restarts. Of all the superhero VR games out there nowadays, Marvel’s Deadpool VR stands with Batman: Arkham Shadow as one of the best. It plays to the strengths of the character to create a one-of-a-kind virtual reality experience, one that’s totally absurd, exhilarating, and unique all at the same time.

2025-11-17T00:15:43,Dispatch Review – Disposable Heroes,"At one point, Telltale was an industry leader when it came to interactive storytelling. Their adaptation of Robert Kirkman’s The Walking Dead birthed a new era of episodic, almost water-cooler gaming. Unfortunately, it was that same boom that led to the studio being spread thin and their many projects dipping beneath expectations and standards they’d set with their early work. After the studio’s infamous bankruptcy, many of the older heads formed AdHoc Studios alongside ex-Night School veterans. Shortly afterward, Dispatch, a bold return to that form of appointment gaming, was revealed. After being popularised in properties like The Boys and Invincible, Dispatch’s world is one where the presence of superheroes and villains is an everyday normality—just a part of the humdrum nature of existing. After his stellar-powered mech suit is destroyed during an altercation with Shroud, the villain who murdered his father and original Mecha Man, Robert Robertson reluctantly takes a desk job as a dispatcher with the Superhero Dispatch Network. He’s tasked with turning around the attention span and poor fortunes of Z-Team, an unreliable, irresponsible group of villains and some kind of suicide squad. The game’s ensemble cast, from top to bottom, is a lovable, ragtag bunch of misfits that I came to adore over the span of the eight episodes. The game’s casting agent deserves a pat on the back, with talent plucked from both Hollywood’s A-list and the internet’s deep pool of influencers and content creators; there truly isn’t a poor performance among them. Clearly, performances from Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright are chief among them, given their resumés; however, the likes of Laura Bailey, Matthew Mercer, and Erin Yvette all reminded me that this is their medium. Even the likes of Jacksepticeye and Alanah Pearce, who are relative upstarts in the acting field compared to the others, were scene-stealers with their more limited roles. By placing the player behind the curtain within a superhero workplace, and getting to see and manage all of the personalities and relationships that exist within it, they were able to do some interesting things with the contrast between public figures, their private lives, and how heroes can struggle to grasp and hold onto a purpose. Dispatch’s writing, which is among my favourites within the superhero genre, is also tremendously witty and funny, and, although Robert himself is far from “the straight man,” the freedom that was seemingly given to these other more online personalities to be funny is great. I found Flambé to be a hoot, especially his stirring karaoke rendition of Meredith Brooks’ “I’m A Bitch”. Being as crude and violent as it is, I don’t imagine Dispatch’s comedy will work for everyone, but I appreciate a callback gag about a short strongman named Punch Up uppercutting enemy dicks as much as the next guy. With how problematic episodic releases became for Telltale near their end, I feel as though the strategy AdHoc settled on for Dispatch, a month-long schedule of two weekly episodes, served the game’s ability to remain in the conversation through tantalising cliff-hangers and immaculate pacing, thanks largely due to the fact the story is delivered across eight TV-length episodes as opposed to five longer ones as was the case with early Telltale. Many people would say Dispatch would have made a damn fine television series, and that removing the gameplay in its entirety would render it a better product. Look, I can’t entirely disagree, but that’s more a credit to how sublime the writing and animation is . The video game that Dispatch is is absolutely fine; in fact, I much prefer its mix of being the man in the chair, system hacking, and quick-time prompts to what Telltale games used to be. I perhaps gave too much credit to games like The Walking Dead on the back of its storytelling alone, but how dispatching loops back to what I feel the point of the narrative is, Robert finding and becoming familiar with this sort of adoptive family, is a far better gameplay hook than playing item fetch. Dispatching itself scratches the logistics lobe of my brain; it’s a balancing act of emergency response, navigating office politics, and nurturing growth among your team of criminals. As urgent events pop up on the Torrance city map, you’ll need to decide under time pressure who the right person for the job is. Of course, there’s an attributes graph for each member that’ll serve as a window into their key strengths and shortcomings. For example, you wouldn’t likely send Golem, a hulking clay colossus, to be the glittering mouthpiece at a press conference when you’ve got Prism, a literal pop star, on staff. Success in the field will grant skill points to either pour into a hero’s chart, and I enjoyed the freedom to min-max or create a more well-rounded jack of all trades. There’s also enormous satisfaction that comes from being able to quell an issue using a character-specific skill because you sent the right person to begin with. Not only is the game scripted wonderfully, but it’s also shot and choreographed better than any recent Marvel flick. In terms of animation and presentation, Dispatch can stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with the likes of Invincible, a world-renowned, flagship animated superhero series on one of the world’s biggest streaming networks. If that isn’t a complement, considering it likely cost a fraction of Invincible’s budget to create, I’m not sure what is. I feel as though the soundtrack is a little understated, although when it kicked into gear, delivering its prototypical Los Angeles synth-pop vibe, it was generally used to great effect and softened the bittersweet blow of having the credits roll. Similarly, I feel like the few licensed songs, all coming from relative unknowns, were A-grade picks, so kudos are deserved for that curation. Dispatch’s story, like the Telltale titles of old, is effectively a ‘choose your own adventure’ story, full of twists, turns, and permutations for you to uncover if you want to. Although I do like ownership of my canon story, I aim to run it back and play the game as my mind’s anti-Robert. The game’s endings are so radically opposing, I’d be eager to see how AdHoc would approach a second series in terms of what is and isn’t canon. I’d absolutely welcome a follow-up; however, I do feel Dispatch wrapped up neatly enough to exist as its own perfect little tale. And as someone who’s played his share, Dispatch is the best “Telltale game” of them all. The PlayStation 5 version of this game was played for the purpose of this review. A digital review code was provided by the publisher. Conclusion Courtesy of an excellent, funny, and heartfelt superhero story that peeks at life behind the mask, Dispatch has made a late charge at the year’s top gong with a scintillating and near flawless eight-episode run, all the while bettering even Telltale’s hallowed best. Positives A terrific narrative take on the superhero genre The dispatch and team management mechanics are simple yet fun The animation is so gorgeously hand-crafted Makes a tremendous example for how to do episodic content Negatives Humour might not land with everybody 9.5 – The post Dispatch Review – Disposable Heroes appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.018820,Brodie Gibbons,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2025/11/17/dispatch-review-disposable-heroes/,4844873f6d8288f2167c1984efb121a5f02e8e76,1371,en,0.1,"At one point, Telltale was an industry leader when it came to interactive storytelling.

2025-11-15T07:49:38,Resident Evil Requiem Interview – Putting The Horror In Survival Horror,"Following many a showing at various events, I finally got a chance to take my turn at playing Resident Evil Requiem this week. The demo, which takes place in a mysterious sanitarium, follows series newcomer Grace Ashcroft as she attempts to escape from a frightening new creature. It’s a simple setup and a simple premise, one which has done great work in keeping us intrigued as Capcom remains deliciously coy about the rest of the game. After the demo, I was able to interview Masato Kumazawa, producer on the game, who has previously worked at Capcom on Kunitsu-Gami , Resident Evil 4 and it’s expansion Separate Ways . He had a lot to say about Requiem, and even indulged a few of the questions I’ve always wanted to ask as a long-term fan of the series. You can read the entirety of my interview below. How do you decide to focus on characters like Grace and tie her back to a character like Alyssa, from deeper in the lore? By putting Grace as the main character, we just wanted to have a fresh new start. So this is for the new players who haven’t played the old Resident Evil games so they can enjoy themselves without prerequisite. But we also wanted to put in a tie-in for the series fans. When you play as Grace and she’s the most scared protagonist in the entire series, it allows us to give a new sense of the new type of survival horror. We decided to put Alyssa’s daughter in the game because when we decided we wanted to revisit the Raccoon City incident, we wanted to have someone who was involved in the incident as well. We wanted to have a character with a nice tie-in, so this is why she was chosen like that. On that topic, when you make a new Resident Evil game, do you have a lot of freedom in who can go back and pick out from the past to bring back? Is there a “lore book” or “lore bible” that you can refer back to with rules, or can you do whatever you want? We don’t have a “lore bible” or anything like that. In the past, we already have a lot of games that have been remade and brought in past characters to life for the modern day. But we wanted to try and make it different from the remakes. We do choose carefully who to bring back to this new game. So when we’re looking into making a new game, and especially the new story, we can kind of think about how we can bring these characters in and how we can offer a new game experience as such. If we do bring in Chris or Leon, you know it will be more action-packed. We try not to insist too much on the past characters, but we do consider them as well. With this game, you’ve let people play first or third person. How challenging is it to make the game remain scary for players regardless of the viewpoint they choose? In terms of first person, I don’t really need to explain too much, you can easily immerse yourself in the gameplay and be closer to enemies, so you are easily scared. For third person, it might seem milder, but by introducing Grace, she is a lot more scared compared to other characters. You will be able to be more scared with her this way. We have added animations when she rushes things when she is scared, or trips over at times. By adding these sort of animations, it adds to the scarey element for the player. I did notice that. Does that mean you think third person adds more challenge than first? Uh, yes, it is, but saying that, we have already made a lot of games that are third-person in the past. We use the experience from these games and bring them into this game. Allowing players to choose between the two perspectives is like making two different games, so it’s challenging in that way. All of the footage we have seen of Requiem so far showcases a new stalker enemy – some people call her Big Mama – but does she have an official name? Do you think the stalker enemy type is integral to the Resident Evil experience now? First, in terms of the stalker, there is an official name. But we can’t disclose that here, because if we do tell you, it will take away from the horror. By saying it’s stalking Grace, we just want to say that we can’t quite say it’s stalking. We can’t say why it looks like this or how it acts like that. We are saying it “might be” stalking her. We just want to say it’s not quite stalking her. Looking back to the last mainline game, Village, if you had to liken the horror to one of the sections from that game, the Castle, the House, the Dam, the Factory, which would you say Requiem most resembles? So we can’t say – we made this game to try and fit in lots of scary situations. We can’t really compare it with Village’s particular scene. If we put Resident Evil 7 as the scariest game, we’d say this is closer to Resident Evil 2. In one of the recent presentations for the game, Nakanishi-san mentioned that the game was originally conceived as an open-world, online multiplayer game. Did any of this design remain in the final game? There are some remaining elements, but we can’t disclose what it is and how it is. Are you sure? *laughs* [in English] Yes, yes. Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild. However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play. But we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they would probably wouldn’t enjoy it as much. That’s the reason we made it back into single player. But because it was fun, we added elements from that build to the final game to ensure it was fun. On that note, Nakanishi-san mentioned that this version was scrapped because it was not what fans wanted. What do you think fans want from Resident Evil? I believe fans of the franchise want is survival horror and being scared. That is the number one thing that fans want. So by saying that, we can’t just slap on new skins and new characters and give you the same experience. It wouldn’t be that good. That’s why we wanted to make sure we added new elements that ensured this feels like a new survival horror game. At the end of Village, people have concerns that the series is slipping back into being too action-heavy. Do you feel pressure to ensure the series doesn’t head into the same territory as Resident Evil 6? Looking back, I understand how Resident Evil 4 and Village became more action-heavy. Yes, that we have to admit. Looking back at the feedback, we understand how fans prefer more horror. Requiem was in development way before Village. We just wanted to make sure in this game, we wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part. I am not sure if all development teams are doing this, but I personally try to read as much or all the comments on social media. So please make sure you give your opinions! My mental health is very strong, I am fine to read the comments. How long has Requiem been in development for, then? So looking back on the online multiplayer game, it’s been in development for around six years or so. In terms of action, Resident Evil 7 and Village both feature action-heavy sequences towards the end. I know you can’t speak about Requiem too much, but do you think it’s “too much” to have a game that’s scary from beginning to end? Yes, you’re correct that towards the end, Village and 7 became very action-heavy, very ACTION ACTION ACTION. So, with Requiem, we decided to make sure it was scary until the end. But to put more details and be more specific, it’s not about scaring people the entire way but using elements of non-horror to improve the horror. For example, you have horror, but then you put a bit of action in there. By putting in the action, and making sure the player isn’t thinking about the horror, the next horror part will scare more effectively than non-stop scares. So we have thought about what order [of scenarios] will be important, and what will be the best order of events that will keep players scared for the whole duration. A Nintendo Switch 2 version was recently revealed for Requiem, which is the first time in a long time that a game has launched day and date with a Nintendo platform. What are some of the unique challenges in developing for the Switch 2 that you’ve encountered? Looking back on Switch, there were Resident Evil games before on the Switch , so what we did, is we used the past experience of developing these games on the Switch to help develop Nintendo Switch 2. But also, we made a lot of versions of the games for PC as well. In fitting with PCs that have a wide variety of specs, we could also just make sure the game was optimised for the Nintendo Switch 2 too. So it wasn’t too hard, so to speak. Can you tell me if there is mouse functionality or anything for the Switch 2? Actually, we tried really hard to implement mouse controls for Nintendo Switch 2. When we did put it in, it confused and convoluted the gameplay and became too complicated. So actually, we are using gyro instead. This is a specific question I’ve personally wanted to ask, so I’m sorry in advance: In the recent Resident Evil games, there haven’t been spiders like they appeared in the original Resident Evil 1, 2 and 3. I’ve heard rumours that there is worry that people who are arachnophobic would not play the game, so they have not been in modern games for that reason. Can you confirm if this is true or not? *laughs* No I don’t think so. I think it’s just a coincidence. The series has been going for a long time and what happens is that with every new game, we have to present like a new element of scary or we have to put in a new variation of scares. So I believe what happened is that, with time, it has dissipated. I think that’s what it is. By the way, Resident Evil 7, there is a spider. Yeah, but they’re not the same, I want BIG HAIRY SPIDERS. *laughs* So you like Spiders? You personally produced Separate Ways, featuring my favourite character Ada Wong. Who is your favourite character? I mean, it could be because I am a producer, but Grace is my favourite character. I mean when you compare Grace with other characters, they’re all strong and ready to combat zombies. Grace is the most scared. She’s very vulnerable, so to say, so when you look at that, I want players to see how Grace will grow and I hope you will grow to like her as you play the game. To finish up, is there anything you want to tell me about Requiem, that you want people to know, that you can’t see in that demo? I guess the one thing I want to let people know is that because Resident Evil is a long-running series, I want people to know they can still play Requiem and enjoy it. There are no prerequisites for the game or prior knowledge required. If this is a new game for them or their entry into the series, I want them also to enjoy this, and that any player can play thanks to difficulties like Casual. Please don’t think there are entry barriers to this game. But by saying that, I am not ignoring series fans. There are elements I have put in this that are very familiar, in the demo you can see leads and links that series fans will enjoy.

2025-11-15T07:49:05,Resident Evil Requiem Won’t Support Mouse Mode On Nintendo Switch 2,"Following it’s surprise reveal for Nintendo Switch 2 in the September 2025 Nintendo Direct, I was intrigued to know just how the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil Requiem stands up to other versions. While there are obvious changes to the visual fidelity that comes with running the game off less powerful hardware, I was intrigued by what else the game would do with the Switch 2’s unique hardware. At a recent preview, I had some hands-on time with the game, playing the Sanitarium demo that you’ve no doubt seen around the internet. But I was also able to get some one-on-one time with the producer of the game, Masato Kumazawa, who has previously worked on the Resident Evil 4 remake and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess . When I asked Kumazawa-san about if there were any challenges unique to development of the Switch 2, he insisted there wasn’t. On the topic, he said: “Looking back on Switch, there were Resident Evil games before on the Switch, so what we did, is we used the past experience of developing these games on the Switch to help develop Nintendo Switch 2. But also, we made a lot of versions of the games for PC as well. In fitting with PCs that have a wide variety of specs, we could also just make sure the game was optimised for the Nintendo Switch 2 too. So it wasn’t too hard, so to speak.” Of course, this lead me to ask if there were any Switch-specific functionality that they could confirm for me. Surprisingly, there was. Kumazawa-san said: “Actually, we tried really hard to implement mouse controls for Nintendo Switch 2. When we put it in, it confused the gameplay and became too complicated. So actually, we are using gyro instead.” It’s worth mentioning that while we can assume there will be amiibo support of some kind for the Switch 2 version utilising the brand new Grace Ashcroft amiibo, we still don’t know how this will work. While the game is less than three months away, a Resident Evil showcase is scheduled for early 2026, which will provide a more detailed look at the game. Beyond that, we’ll have to wait.

2025-11-15T07:48:22,Resident Evil Requiem Hands-On Preview – Short But Sweet,"Resident Evil was one of the first series I was fully invested in, when I picked up my first-ever game at the tender age of eight. I assumed it would be fine, but wasn’t ready for what would follow. That game was Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, and it informed many of my tastes, including my penchant for horror. To think the series has been going for almost three decades is nothing short of astounding. Even more remarkable is that, despite having watched and consumed every piece of media available for Resident Evil Requiem, I still found a few surprises when I played it this week. And while Capcom is still coy about how the game will play outside of what I’ve played, it sets a good scene for where Requiem is headed. The preview opens with newcomer Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from the Outbreak games, waking up to find herself suspended upside down in a gurney. Her blood is being collected for some reason, but she obviously doesn’t want to stick around to find out why. Letting herself free, Grace, armed with nothing but her fear, sets out to escape what appears to be a sanatorium. However, it’s not that simple, and things can become quite hectic quite quickly. From the outset, while the demo is light on story details or even the combat the series is traditionally known for, it’s clear that Resident Evil Requiem is trying to do something different. While the idea of darkness in a horror game is hardly anything new , games haven’t played with the concept of light and dark like Requiem appears to be doing. The way the tension is built is masterfully done – I was genuinely worried to turn the light on in a room for fear of what I might see. Of course, the game uses statues and furniture to trick you into seeing things that aren’t actually there, too. But no more does this become more evident than with the new creature that Requiem throws at you a few minutes into your exploration. This is a new type of enemy in the game, and it is unlike anything the games have thrown at me before. I tried my hardest to trick or outsmart the AI of this creature, which towers over Grace, but it feels pretty intelligent overall. It’s scared of light, which will presumably have some story explanation later, but it does everything it can to work out where you are when you’re hiding, and sometimes even removes hiding places too. It reminds me of Alien Isolation , though I am sure that as the game progresses, it will begin to resemble the games that came before it, like 7 and Village . Grace herself moves rather slowly, however, which is an intentional design choice. Though interestingly, she moves differently depending on which viewpoint you are playing the game from. Requiem is a first for the series in that it allows you to play either first or third person at any point. First-person is a lot more tense and easier to get immersed in. The third-person perspective feels like more recent Resident Evil remakes, but it removes some of the tension. That tension is added back into the mix by making Grace a bit more trippy and fumbly when playing in third-person, but the horror is overall a lot milder, as you can see a lot more. The actual demo itself was simple, reminding me a lot of the early demos for both Resident Evil 7 and Village . You explore a location, avoid a monster, and find some items that’ll help you escape. It’s not quite the management of inventory that you’d expect, but it’s evident that’s coming at some point after this demo ends anyway. There were also not many puzzles (actually, there weren’t any), but again, I am sure this will come once Grace is released from the sanatorium and left to her own devices. It’s hard to comment on what else Requiem has in store, as the demo we played is intentionally vague. What I have played is really all I can comment on, and so far, I think that while the “stalker” enemy type is growing a bit long in the tooth, this does feel dynamic and different enough to separate itself from other pursuers like Lady Dimitrescu, Nemesis and Mr. X. But there’s still a lot for Requiem to prove, and hopefully, Capcom will detail more soon to satiate a fanbase that is growing nothing short of ravenous. However, given how vague Resident Evil 7 was before its release, and how that game ultimately turned out, I have complete confidence in the team bringing this game to life. The way Requiem is already committed to evolving series staples is more than enough assurance that, as Capcom says, Resident Evil Requiem will scare us in new and exciting ways when it releases in February. Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27th 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S.

2025-11-14T13:59:02,Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Hands-On Preview – Primed And Ready,"It’s hard to believe that after all this time we’re finally about to get Metroid Prime 4: Beyond in our hands, and I got the chance to go hands-on with the longest demo yet before launch. This was actually my third time playing the game, and the first little bit was that same intro section that I’d played at both Nintendo Experience events (and was also available at Pax last month), however I did get to play this in handheld mode which marked the first time that the game had been played this way. Unsurprisingly, it runs super well in handheld mode and looks just as good as it does on TV, without losing any frames. Really, this is the case for the entire game, and without doubt, this is Nintendo’s most ambitious game graphically yet. It is just absolutely stunning and the art really shines here with every little piece of flora and fauna coming to life. This also marked (to my knowledge) the first time that I was able to play in 4K/60 FPS (as opposed to the 1440p/120hz mode) and it did not disappoint. I really think you’d be a disservice to yourself to not play this on a Switch 2 particularly if you’re a diehard Metroid fan. The main portion of this demo took place in an overflowing jungle like location called Fury Green. Upon being transported to this location, the music sets in, and it finally hits – Metroid Prime is back. The track that plays while you explore Fury Green feels classic Metroid. It has the alien and operatic undertones that make the tracks instantly recognisable as not just Metroid, but Metroid Prime specifically. In this sense, it really feels like Retro has nailed the feel of Prime over two decades on. It’s not just the presentation that feels familiar either. Samus moves just like you’d expect her to and all of her basic abilities are here – though with some new twists. My opening moments I took some time to feel how the beam and charge beam works and, just as you’d expect, they feel the same. More importantly, the way Prime 4 controls feels familiar, but there are a bunch of new control schemes available here too. You can opt for the classic controls, turn a joy-con on the side for Switch 2 mouse style controls or even a control scheme that is more reminiscent of the New Play versions of Prime on Wii. I often found myself flicking between the WiiMote pointer style controls and mouse controls and the great thing is that you can just go between the two without having to change a setting, so if you want to put your Joy-Con down for a bit to use it like a mouse, that works fantastically here (it’s absolutely the best use so far), and similarly, if you want to use traditional controls or use your Joy-Con like a pointer htey both work great too. Whilst this is a Metroid Prime game through and through, the more I played, the more it was obvious that there’s absolutely some changes here. Whilst it’s early days, it appears that Samus only has two visors now – Combat and Psychic. Combat is the standard view you’ll be using most of the time, while Psychic rolls a whole bunch of features into one, allowing Samus to manipulate latent psychic energy around Viewros while also allowing her to scan, a series staple at this point. Switching between them with a single button feels good enough, especially as you’ll have to juggle them in combat at some point. And combat is what you’ll be doing a lot of, at least in these early opening moments. Perhaps what will be one of the numerous points of contention between series purists and more casual fans will be Prime 4 willingness to just pit you in an arena against waves of enemies. It’s feels like a tone similar to Corruption, with more numerous battles to fight in, though I’m willing to chalk this up to being a fast-paced introduction to the dangers of Viewros more than anything else. THE CHEAPEST COPY: $84 WITH FREE SHIPPING AT AMAZON The other, more obvious point of contention in Metroid Prime 4 will no doubt be Myles Mackenzie. He’s a mouthy engineer working for the Galactic Federation that Samus encounters during her time exploring Fury Green. Presumably stranded on Viewros too, Mackenzie asks to tag along with Samus. Samus agrees, but then Mackenzie is constantly hootin’ and hollerin’ as she battles enemies and solves puzzles. If you’re a Metroid fan who cut your teeth on anything besides Other M or Corruption, you’ve probably got your eyebrows raised at this point, and you’d be right. Having Mackenzie tag along, be downed, and require revival, feels anything but Metroid, but there is hopefully light at the end of the tunnel. On one hand, I like the idea that we get to finally see what grunts think of Samus and people are paying her the respect she deserve as a character. The inclusion of Mackenzie means does give somebody to bounce off of Samus’ stoic, speechless personality in a way that can be comical. On the other, his interruptions during his first introduction feel anything but Metroid and he is in stark opposition to the tone of a Metroid game. It appears that Mackenzie might get left behind in a hub area while Samus gallivants around Viewros as she finds her way off the planet, but it also won’t stop him from radioing her at any given moment. It’s too early to say whether this will end up being a good thing in regards to the story and overall tone of Metroid Prime 4. It’s obviously a bold choice and one that we’ll have to wait to see in terms of whether it pays off. The other major change to Prime 4 is the new Psychic Abilities that Samus comes across on in Viewros. Harnessing the latent energy floating around the planet, the Psychic abilties allow Samus to see platforms that aren’t normally there, manipulate switches from a distance and act as a conduit to move energy from one area to the next. They’re a cool idea, but they also feel a bit gimmicky at times. The Control Beam, a controllable projectile that Samus can shoot and control remotely while slowing down time, feels just like the Beetle from Skyward Sword. This was most used in the second boss battle that I got to undertake in the game, a plant-based beast named Carvex who continually grows more tentacles as time goes on, with Samus needing to shoot the armour off of them, and then use the Control Beam to get around obstacles and take all of them out so they don’t regenerate before you can take out the rest. It made great use of the Control Beam, and again, it’s one that we’ll need to play the entirety of the game to see whether these new abilities feel like a great addition. And that is ultimately the big concern with Metroid Prime 4. It’s shaping up to be an incredible game but there are some elements here that might hold it back from standing so confidently aside both Metroid Prime 1 and 2, particularly the open hubs which I didn’t get to experience in this demo. While Corruption was by no means a bad game, it did feel notably scaled back from the games that came before it. While there are no more motion controller gimmicks to hitch its space boots on this time around, Prime 4 does have a huge task ahead of itself. And we can only hope it’ll achieve it come December.

2025-11-13T23:15:53,A Death Stranding Animated Series Is Being Produced For Disney Plus,"Kojima Productions has announced that, in addition to the previously announced live-action and animated films, an animated TV series based on Death Stranding is being produced, with an expected release in 2027 on Disney+. It’s expected to be presented in “traditional, hand-drawn 2D animation” and to follow an entirely new story within the game’s world. It’s expected to explore the story of a yet-to-be-named man and woman in North America. The show’s synopsis reads: “Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way.” Hideo Kojima will serve as the series’ executive producer, while it’ll be helmed by Takayuki Sano. His previous works include Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, and Jujutsu Kaisen 0. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was released this year to critical acclaim ; however, through endeavours such as the Strands of Harmony world tour, which brought music from the games to a live audience, and the aforementioned films, which are in production, the IP is certainly evolving product-to-product.

2025-11-11T23:00:01,An Official PlayStation Monitor With A Built-In DualSense Charging Hook Has Been Revealed,"PlayStation has today announced an official PlayStation monitor. It’s 27-inches in size, has a 1440p resolution, a 240hz refresh rate (120hz maximum when connected to PS5) and VRR support. What’s more interesting though is the fact that it features as swiveling DualSense controller charging hook so that you can keep your controller charged and ready to go below your monitors at all time. The sad news is that it’s only coming to the US and Japan at this stage, which is in-line with all of Sony’s other gaming monitors in its InZONE brand, although given this one is an official PlayStation accessory, we’re more hopeful that it will come to Australia. Here’s how it’s described on the PlayStation blog: “The 27″” Gaming Monitor with DualSense® Charging Hook features a QHD screen with HDR visuals*, up to 240 Hz refresh rate* with VRR support* for smooth gameplay, and a convenient DualSense® wireless controller charging hook to keep you ready for action anytime.

2025-11-11T16:59:12,Possessor(s) Review – A Heartfelt Metroidvania,"One thing I respect about Heart Machine is their willingness to attack different genres with each subsequent project. Hyper Light Drifter, I imagine, enjoyed enough success that they could have settled into a comfortable loop of resting on their laurels. Solar Ash felt like a more personal, story-forward approach to a shared universe, while Hyper Light Breaker, their attempt at an action roguelike, floundered in early access and sadly amounted to little more than layoffs for the studio. Possessor(s), their first game under the Devolver Digital umbrella after a run of self-publishing and dealing with other publishing houses, on the surface, looks like their most derivative project yet, at a time when the studio most desperately needs a win. Despite being a much darker game than their previous works, I expect Possessor(s) will appeal to those who’ve appreciated Heart Machine’s approach to world craft and the effort they’ve poured into setting and straight-up vibes. After a demon-led invasion leads to a cataclysm that leaves the city of Sanzu and protagonist Luca alike at death’s door, Luca cuts a deal with Rhem, a desperate demon in need of a host body, as the pair band together against Rhem’s own kind in pursuit of their individual interests. As opposite as east and west, it’s really their dynamic and their entwined stories, which both revolve around storming the lab central to the outbreak, that provide the launching pad for the game’s world to flourish. Beyond the co-leads’ need to co-exist, Possessor(s) paints a haunting, catastrophic image of a sprawling mega-city where the fragmented remains of humanity live in the shadows while the darkness takes grip. It’s a tired expression, but the city itself really is its own character, not since Symphony of the Night have I been so engrossed in exploring every granular part of a game’s map, and that speaks volumes of how well it is designed, and how rewarding combing through every inch can be. Although the world isn’t teeming with signs of life, the characters that do crop up are either askew, on their way to being driven mad by the apocalypse, or possessed in their own right by Rhem’s frenemies. With most of the map’s regions having their own self-contained subplots, these small, emotional arcs are oftentimes just as good as the overarching story. So far as I’ve seen, the game has shied away from referring to itself as a Metroidvania; however, the characteristics are undeniable. Sanzu is a big, interconnected maze of corridors that join up after acquiring Luca’s traversal abilities, creating a series of cleverly crafted paths for the player to navigate. Better yet, these abilities serve a double purpose in combat, especially Luca’s whip, which can bring aerial demons to ground. If it weren’t for the surprisingly helpful map, I would consider getting around to be somewhat obtuse, but I do think the game could do a better job of spelling out what paths are newly available based on your latest pickup. So many of the areas are accessible, although not entirely explorable, meaning you’ll do a lot of backtracking, although this is made less painful thanks to an elegant fast travel network. With a few issues I’ve had with repeated dialogue and cutscenes, I expect it’s somewhat easy to break the developer’s intended or expected sequence of events, which did feel like somewhat of a betrayal of the game’s openness and sense of freedom. Similarly, because the level design places the ability “gates” well into their respective areas, there was an occasion where I got stuck in an area with no means of escape outside of reverting to a previous save. The combat in Possessor(s) is immaculately layered, giving off the feeling of a platform fighting game more than a regular action game. In-world, the demons scramble for any host as their corporeal bodies break down, so everyday items are utilised in creative, often hilarious, ways. You brandish things like kitchen knives and hockey sticks as your main offense; however, it’s your secondaries where you can mix up your approach to combat. Taking the appearance of bog-standard household effects, like a computer mouse, a cell phone, or leather gloves, these items can be useful for creating space, while your whip does the opposite, pounding the ground around you with an electric current, or reducing a demon to cinders with a superlative suplex. There’s been a fun approach to enemy design, which piggybacks off of this same principle. Of course, there is a share of powerful demons who’ve not yet felt the need to abandon their perfect forms; however, it’s when you’re being chased by a flapping leatherbound book, or lined up by a security camera, that I couldn’t help but laugh at how absurd Possessor(s) can be. While it doesn’t go full tilt in emulating a fighting game, I do think the game encourages you to get a feel for the combos available to you, which often results in a satisfying flurry of air and ground offense. Unlike the Hyper Light and Solar Ash titles, which set their experiences within a dystopic landscape splashed with pastels and neons, Possessor(s) feels like a much darker slice from the Heart Machine universe. It’s a sickly world, torn asunder by the demon threat, and it’s heavily punctuated by darkness and blood-red highlights—it isn’t monotone by any stretch of the imagination; however, it does abandon the alien beauty of the prior titles in favour of a grittier approach. With the game’s action focus, I can’t fault the animation or hit windows, which have been carefully hand-animated on top of the 3D rendered background. There’s a Supergiant touch to how character renders accompany dialogue windows, and I do expect a certain corner of the web to go nuts for Rhem—he could easily be this year’s Astarion. For a game driven by characters, it’s a shame there isn’t a recorded voiceover to sell the heaviness of some of the subject matter; it feels like a missed opportunity, although I do expect it would be a budgetary decision. The sound design and soundtrack, on the other hand, are great; the crunchiness of combat and whipping a corded mouse around to a mix of soft rock is a fine mix. Possessor(s) feels like a more accessible means of entering this shared universe; it isn’t as brutal as Drifter, and it feels more engaging than Solar Ash, which was more experiential and explorative like a Team Ico game. It prioritises story and characters within a really well-realised Metroidvania, or “search-action”, setting and delivers this year’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. The PC version of this game was played for the purpose of this review. A digital review code was provided by the publisher. Conclusion With a map that pleads to be unlocked and explored wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling, as well as tremendous combat inspired by the best platform fighters, Possessor(s) is a heartfelt, and most unexpectedly great, Metroidvania that treats story and action, two distinct and unique facets of game design, as equals in this lovely story of coexisting. Positives A beautiful sprawling interconnected world Complex character work and world-building Gripping combat that calls to mind the best platform fighters you've played Art design that's both bleak and stunning Negatives Getting stuck in areas due to less than ideal map-gating Lack of voiceover feels like an unfortunate ommission given the focus on its characters 8 – The post Possessor(s) Review – A Heartfelt Metroidvania appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.044116,Brodie Gibbons,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2025/11/12/possessors-review-a-heartfelt-metroidvania/,c57911caa0c43bd8e0cd8cab283797cfa180a0d7,1390,en,0.1,"One thing I respect about Heart Machine is their willingness to attack different genres with each subsequent project.

2025-11-11T13:50:02,Lumines Arise Review – For Those About To Block,"Tetris is arguably the most famous puzzle video game ever to exist, shifting Game Boys several decades before it’d be perfected by Enhance with Tetris Effect, a sublime cocktail of Tetris’ tried and true gameplay fundamentals and a powerful, transcendent synesthesia audiovisual presentation that felt like lingering, detached from my corporeal form, in a celestial fever dream of music and lights. And although I don’t have a touchstone with Lumines, hearing that Enhance would be plying their unique trade with another much-beloved series filled me with an expectant joy and a wanderlust to return to those same stars they once transported me to. And so Lumines Arise has arrived, buoyed by the very same care Enhance took with transforming Tetris, for me, from a frantic, panicked line-clear rush into a beautiful, picturesque zen garden, of sorts. It’s all in the vibes, but don’t get me wrong, there is a learning curve to Lumines that initially feels severe, and failure is sure to greet the uninitiated; however pleasant it may still be. Fortunately, Enhance has included all manner of tutorials, challenges, and back-end toggles to help players either practice or set the game to their own pace. For those who, like me, knew more about Enhance than Lumines coming in, the game’s loop is rather simple. Like Tetris, there’s a variety of 2×2 blocks that you’ll be able to drop into the field of play. These blocks will be made up of a combination of two patterns, which vary from stage to stage; however, the goal is to match pairs of squares to make larger blocks, which’ll be wiped from the field after every measure of eight beats. The loop is intrinsically tied to rhythm and sound, and there’s a timing to it all that’s a little harder to grasp because paired blocks don’t immediately clear like lines in Tetris, but once I managed to lock in, I really grew to appreciate what this game does and how it differentiates itself from contemporary puzzle games. You’ll gradually gain charge as you play, and once fifty percent or higher, you’re able to activate Burst. Although I didn’t always find it useful as a survival tactic, it is key to racking up high, leaderboard-topping scores for those who’ll hunt a stage’s S rank threshold. All stages are multi-phase; later levels have up to five individual boards to make it through. Things do tend to get a bit hairier in the second half of any given level, and the sense of escalation is sold beautifully through the abrupt shifts in audiovisual flourishes. There are some staggeringly jaw-dropping effects on display throughout Lumines’ roster of stages. I do question whether it’s as tonally consistent as Tetris Effect level-to-level, although I felt the peaks in Lumines Arise were higher, with some of the images now being burned into my mind forever. The canvas to each stage is one thing, but Enhance got very cute and creative with how the 2×2 blocks would morph to suit a stage’s theme, whether it meant they were mixes of fruits and vegetables, eggs and feathers, or shells. I appreciated the effort to make each phase feel special. There were just a few stages where I did find the differences too subtle, and that lack of readability did dent the enjoyment just a tad, though these were as rare as hen’s teeth in the grand scheme of things. The game’s soundtrack, once again composed by Hydelic, who returns after Tetris Effect, is a buffet of moods. While the visuals are undoubtedly spectacular, they’re but one half of a truly special combination, and the immersion that comes from chucking on a pair of headphones and entering the daydream that is Lumines Arise is, in a word, magical. Much like Tetris Effect, one of the game’s central pillars is its Journey mode, where you’re tasked with clearing the aforementioned multi-phase stages in an effort to, for lack of a clearer explanation, restore the light. Depending on your skill set, it’ll likely be a source of frustration to get through, but, no matter who you are, it’s an affecting, emotional experience—one that Enhance can proudly hang their hat on. Of course, there are other modes there to keep you occupied after you roll credits, including a survival mode where you’re expected to, without failing, play each of the story’s stages in sequence. This kind of sorcery is beyond my comprehension, so I’ve not even considered taking a run at it. With the Journey mode itself only lasting me somewhere in the realm of six to eight hours, you’d hope that it’d be the extra challenges and robust multiplayer that will keep players coming back days or weeks afterward, and give it the legs needed to build its community up as Tetris Effect did. Sadly, I don’t think the offering at launch is much to write home about. Perhaps it’s simply due to how restrictive the puzzle loop is, but only having custom and ranked Burst Battle modes does feel awfully underwhelming, and it does concern me about the game’s long-term prospects. Granted, it’s fun in its own right, but I just don’t see a singular competitive mode forming the basis of a thriving community. Similarly, I’m a bit disappointed with Lumines Arise’s approach to player expression; the Loomii avatar customisation is a bit so-so, and the way you unlock things through a gachapon-style lucky dip does tend to take away a little bit of the individualism in how you present your avatar as I tend to slap on whatever the latest thing I’ve unlocked is, whether it’s what I’m wanting or not. Parsing through between the locked and unlocked items in your inventory is also a bit of a nightmare; there’s no means to filter, and items scroll in no particular order at all. Although I’ve seen some pretty cool avatars wandering the online lobby, I’m content enough with my hexagonal head and title to not delve too deeply into the loot treadmill that is the Lumines gacha machine. Despite an inability to deliver what I feel is a worthwhile multiplayer aside, I do think the team at Enhance are the absolute masters of what they do in delivering an overwhelming, cathartic, zenful experience that hoists you from your body and takes you on a damn near spiritual voyage all in the guise of a near-perfect puzzle game. Lumines Arise is that, and I can’t recommend it enough for those who felt an adoration for the originals or Tetris Effect, because there are few better than this. The PC version of this game was played for the purpose of this review. A digital review code was provided by the publisher. Conclusion Lumines Arise, despite not being the full package, is a once-in-a-generation puzzler where Enhance has, as they did with Tetris, extracted the spirit of an iconic puzzler, they have taken all of its fundamentals, and form-perfected it alongside irresistible, cosmic audiovisual splendour that really does need to be seen, heard, and played to be believed. Positives As a Lumines newcomer, it's a tremendously addictive core loop A spectacular audiovisual journey Enough challenges and missions to keep you busy beyond the Journey mode Great accessibility and customisation options Negatives With a single mode, multiplayer seems undercooked Loomii customisation is a little sparse 8.5 – The post Lumines Arise Review – For Those About To Block appeared first on Press Start .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.046099,Brodie Gibbons,Press Start,https://press-start.com.au/reviews/pc-reviews/2025/11/12/lumines-arise-review-for-those-about-to-block/,4b862f552af2b510627531b600e7bde5c4b03d36,1391,en,0.1,"Tetris is arguably the most famous puzzle video game ever to exist, shifting Game Boys several decades before it’d be perfected by Enhance with Tetris Effect, a sublime cocktail of",other,0.25

2025-11-06T17:32:54,Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review – A Fitting Send-Off,"I think it’s fair to say that when Hyrule Warriors originally released on the Wii U, very few people would’ve expected it to lead to where the spin-off series is today. What was once a celebration of the franchise has quickly become a method to expand the lore, world, and storytelling of The Legend of Zelda with a gameplay framework that simply wouldn’t work in the mainline series. The expectations of a Hyrule Warriors game have never been higher than what they are now with Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, and while it mostly delivers, it does stumble along the way. Where Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is a non-canon retelling of the titular Great Calamity , Age of Imprisonment shoulders the burden of canonically filling in the gaps left by Tears of the Kingdom’s millenia-spanning narrative. Specifically, it’s the story of what happens to Princess Zelda after she travels back in time just as Ganondorf is awoken from his slumber. While we see bits of the founding of Hyrule and the all-important Imprisoning War in Tears of the Kingdom, Age of Imprisonment seeks to expand on those events with more detail than before. If you’re a lore nerd, there’s heaps to dig into here – many of the cutscenes further expand on ancient Hyrule, the Zonai, and the Demon King in this part of The Legend of Zelda canon. If you aren’t that hardcore, though, you might find much of Age of Imprisonment’s narrative to be somewhat lacking. It sometimes can just feel like an expansion of what we already know, dots that we’ve already connected as of two years ago. Some of Tears of the Kingdom’s Dragon Tear cutscenes are ripped from that game and put into this one, which makes sense all things considered, but lessens the impact of the story being told here. It does pick up exponentially in the third act, though, with all of Hyrule coming together in a final showdown with Ganondorf in an attempt to thwart his grasp at power. The sheer scale and size of the Imprisoning War is fully realised in Age of Imprisonment’s final hours, and it leaves a lasting impression. It’s also nice to spend more time with characters like Rauru, Mineru, and Sonia. The new characters here are similarly engaging, with a boisterous and brave Korok known as Calamo, accompanied by a strange Zonai construct whose steadfast opposition against the Demon King is unexplainable yet inspiring. Zelda gets some great moments here, too, that are well-deserved and long overdue in this era of 3D Zelda, which feels apt given how pivotal her role is in Tears of the Kingdom. Of all the Warriors games tied to Nintendo intellectual property, the one with the strongest gameplay for me is undoubtedly Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Age of Imprisonment feels like a safer sequel than that game when compared to the original Hyrule Warriors, building on many of the ideas and systems introduced in Age of Calamity with some fun new ideas that shake things up a bit. Part of the reason I think Age of Calamity succeeds as a Warriors title is its seamless melding of Musou mainstays with Breath of the Wild’s hallmark features . The Sheikah Slate and its powers were effortlessly integrated into the combat loop without robbing the game of its pacing. Age of Imprisonment attempts to do the same with Tears of the Kingdom’s mechanics, with varying degrees of success. The core tenets of what made Age of Calamity work are still here – enemies will unleash powerful attacks that can only be countered by Unique Skills. These are character-specific abilities on a cooldown that will stagger enemies if you employ the right one at the right time, rewarding you with a satisfying counter and a window of opportunity to deplete their Weak-Point Gauge and unleash a devastating attack. While these skills are inherently less tied to Tears of the Kingdom compared to what Age of Calamity’s Sheikah Slate is to Breath of the Wild, Age of Imprisonment also brings Zonai Devices into the mix. These battery-powered devices are taken from Tears of the Kingdom, from the elemental emitters to less conventional options like the fan or rocket. These also work as methods of countering enemy attacks while doubling as a way to exploit elemental weaknesses and inflict status effects. THE CHEAPEST PRICE: $84 WITH FREE SHIPPING FROM AMAZON They’re great fun to use, especially in conjunction with the environment for maximum effect. My only gripe is that there simply aren’t enough button shortcuts for how many you’ll use in any given mission, especially in the back half of the game. It means you’ll often spend time in menus, no matter how you equip your characters, taking you out of the action as you cycle through devices until you find what you need. It interrupts the otherwise excellent pacing and flow of combat, which is at its best when frenzied and chaotic. I also think the roster here is a slight downgrade. I suspect this is the cost of being a canon story, but Age of Imprisonment lacks many of the fun character inclusions of Age of Calamity or the original Hyrule Warriors. Silly guys akin to Hestu, Master Kohga, or Tingle are nowhere to be found here. It feels like a missed opportunity with all the oddballs found in this interpretation of Hyrule, and especially as a send-off to this era of 3D Zelda. I want to elaborate that what is here is still a lot of fun. Zelda sheds her caster role from Age of Calamity in favour of using a light-emitting blade that puts her into close quarters without abandoning her godly powers. King Rauru wields a lengthy spear that sweeps through waves of foes as Zonai technology whips it through the air for additional hits as you mash the heavy attack button. The Sages all represent their elements in ways that feel distinct, which is quite the achievement, given we’ve now seen three sets in the last 10 years. The real highlights are the Mysterious Construct and Calamo, who are often paired together. The Mysterious Construct plays similarly to Link from Age of Calamity, capable of wielding different weapon types that each have a unique moveset. This character (and others) can also Fuse monster parts to weapons for increased Weak-Point Gauge damage, and even incorporates the Zonai Devices you have equipped on shortcuts into its combos. Calamo is a bit of a goofball, but his nimble nature and ability to quickly output all types of elemental damage make him a blast to dart around the battlefield with. To encourage you to think about how you compile your teams and character pairing further, Age of Imprisonment also introduces Sync Strikes. These are abilities that can only be used when two characters have filled their Sync Strike Gauges by performing various actions. There are quite a few of these, each with different effects. Some will deal big damage in an area, while others will imbue characters with elemental damage types while increasing offensive capability. These can make quick work of powerful foes when used properly, and every single one is a spectacle to look at. This provides some much-needed variation because Age of Imprisonment is perhaps the least innovative Warriors entry when it comes to map and encounter design. Despite having access to Hyrule, The Depths, and the Sky Islands of Tears of the Kingdom , very little is done to shake up key mission objectives here. It almost always boils down to liberating outposts, defeating monsters, and sometimes beating a boss. Maps are similarly dull in how linear they are, providing very few opportunities to actually explore and engage with the world. It feels like a definitive step down from previous Hyrule Warriors games, and especially from this year’s Dynasty Warriors: Origins. It also never really feels like it’s interested in challenging you or forcing you to think about how you command units and navigate the battlefield. Even the side missions with time limits feel overly generous in how easy it is to beat them in time. I understand this genre has always had a turn your brain off kind of mentality, but there’s always been some level of strategy in how you manage your army to avoid defeat that isn’t present in Age of Imprisonment. One part of Age of Imprisonment that took me by surprise completely is the inclusion of Star Fox-like rail-shooter levels, where you take flight as the Mysterious Construct. These are extremely infrequent but provide a nice break from all the hacking and slashing. They’re fairly straightforward, with guided flight paths and numerous Zonai Device pickups that expand your arsenal of weaponry. It’s also a fantastic use of the world, often blending the three layers of Hyrule to strong effect. Another area Age of Imprisonment absolutely delivers is in content. While much of it is repetitious owing to the aforementioned map and objective design, there is a lot here to sink your teeth into. The map positively fills up with icons after each battle, some yielding character upgrades, shops, training facilities, and more. Others will lead to optional missions that liberate certain areas of Hyrule, opening them up for future unlocks and missions. It’s a simple and streamlined form of progression, but it’s moreish to see Hyrule turn blue as you earn the approval of the people and free the land of the Demon King’s scourge. Because these Warriors games have always been relegated to Nintendo hardware, they’ve often struggled with performance issues. The sheer number of enemies on the screen in tandem with fast action would lead to inevitable frame rate drops on the Switch and Wii U, but the power of the Switch 2 means it’s an issue that Age of Imprisonment mostly dodges. The game runs at a smooth 60 frames per second with very infrequent drops in handheld mode. Docked play is flawless, and the experience is a visual delight, owing to the timelessness of the aesthetic and art direction of these Zelda games. Handheld mode also occasionally suffers from some noticeable resolution scaling, which also happens to be when those intermittent frame drops occur. It’s noticeable but far from distracting, and it’s easy to get swept up in the action and forget it’s scaling down to begin with. Even in the instances I did pay attention to it, I noticed it swiftly scaled back up to the original image quality. It took some time, but we finally have a handheld Warriors game that looks and performs very well when all things are said and done. While not as strong as Age of Calamity overall, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a worthy send-off for this era of 3D Zelda. Its weak story is made memorable by an excellent conclusion, and even if the gameplay loop is generally weaker, it’s still a damn good time to rip through the hordes of the Demon King. Conclusion While there are many elements of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment that don't quite reach the standard set by Age of Calamity, there are just as many that it exceeds. It's another engaging Hyrule Warriors experience that fans are sure to eat up and feels like a fitting goodbye to this chapter of Zelda.

In its first two quarters on sale, the Nintendo Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units which is well ahead of the original Switch (4.7 million) and the PS5 (7.8 million) cementing its place as the fastest selling console of all time. It’s selling so well in fact that Nintendo has raised its hardware forecast up to 19m units (from 15 million) for the whole financial year. As far as games go, Mario Kart World managed to sell 9.57 million units (that includes bundles sold), Donkey Kong Bananza sold 3.49 million units and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Jamboree both managed to shift another 1.37 million units. No other Nintendo Switch 2 software was listed, but we’d expect this to change next time around.

2025-10-27T05:54:11,ROG Xbox Ally X Review – A Promising Glimpse Into The Future,"Over a year ago, I took a look at the ROG Ally X which was a decent improvement over the original Ally, and ASUS and Xbox have now partnered to introduce Xbox’s first branded handheld in the ROG Xbox Ally X which builds on the Ally X in some interesting ways. A lot of what I wrote in my ROG Ally X review is still relevant today , with these devices sharing an overwhelming amount of similarities, with this review aiming to talk about what’s next in the ROG Xbox Ally X and what might be coming in the future. If you’ve been following the Windows handheld market for the last 2-3 years, you’ll know what this device is about, but an important thing to cover is the fact that even though this device is being labelled as an Xbox handheld, it is a Windows handheld, which is actually better as it can not only play every single new first-party Xbox game, but it can also play games from every other launcher including Steam and Epic Games Stores. This is clearly going to be Xbox’s way of thinking moving forward with its new console rumoured to be also more of a PC than ever before. The strength of these handhelds running Windows for compatibility has also been coupled with the fact that obviously Windows wasn’t designed to be on a handheld which brings navigation issues and little quirks, and this has begun to be addressed with an updated Xbox app that brings in all of your games from other launchers, as well as an Xbox full-screen experience which I’ll touch on in a little bit. Whilst I can absolutely see the vision with this, it is still very much early days. An example of this is the fact that the initial boot-up is still your generic Windows 11 boot-screen which works absolutely perfectly, but it’s far from the experience that you get with the Steam Deck or a Nintendo Switch for example. Once you are through the setup, you then boot into the new Xbox full-screen experience, which is already fantastic. As I mentioned, you can now pull in all of your other launcher games into the Xbox app, or launch them through Armory Crate, but it’s switching between apps and closing games through the new full-screen task manager that is an absolute joy and feels so natural to the handheld, rather than having to tap around the full Windows experience. This comes with a advantages to performance too as you’re not running a bunch of unnecessary backgrounds tasks and whilst these seemed to be minimal so far, I think it’ll get better with time as more features are introduced. You can of course still load into the full Windows experience quite easily but in my few weeks of testing, I haven’t needed to yet. GRAB IT FROM: THE ASUS ESHOP The new Xbox button on the ROG Ally X brings up the Windows Game Bar and a long press brings up that full-screen task switcher which runs incredibly smoothly. You’ve got an Armory Crate button to pull up that window in order to quickly change between performance modes, or turn on real-time monitoring and a bunch of other settings, and you’ve also got a library button that takes you straight to your Xbox games library. Another thing that Xbox does incredibly well (better than anyone) is handle cloud saves and game licenses and with consoles, PC, this handheld and Cloud Streaming all operating in different places, it really means that you can jump between your console and this handheld to play games on the Xbox app with absolute ease, and again it’s something that I’d only expect to improve. These are all huge improvements on what was there before and just bring consistency and uniformity to the Windows experience which greatly differed depending on which handheld that you were using. It’s worth mentioning that this full-screen experience is coming to other handhelds as well, so it’s absolutely the future for these handhelds. Outside of those few new buttons, the inputs of of the ROG Xbox Ally X are identical to that of the ROG Ally X. In addition to dual USB-C ports and a MicroSD slot, you’ve got your start and select buttons, four face buttons, two analogue sticks, a decent d-pad, two back buttons, bumpers and triggers, which have been adjusted on the X model to feel more like Xbox controllers. The big difference here is that the entire design has been changed in order to look and feel like an Xbox controller which most regard as the best feeling controller and it absolutely translates to the handheld experience too, giving you much more to hold onto and feeling great over a longer period of time. As far as the screen goes, it’s the same 7-inch 1080p display that was in the Ally X with its 120hz refresh rate and VRR. Obviously, I’d have loved an OLED option and whilst the 7-inch display does feel a bit small, it is still an extremely fantastic display and no doubt we’ll see other options pop-up in the very near future. The ROG Xbox Ally X has the new Z2 Extreme chip and it’s definitely an improvement (when added in with the background task saving measures of the new full-screen experience), but it’s not night and day. The reality is that you’re going to get a handful of more frames when playing at 25w in AAA games, but it’s the lowest tiers when paired with indie games where the chip can perform much better without chewing through battery. The Z2 Extreme chip is capable of running at 35w when plugged in and this does make for a decent experience above the Z1 Extreme, but again, it’s not a night and day experience, and overall just makes for smoother gameplay. For instance, I was able to boot up Battlefield 6, Cyberpunk 2077 and Ninja Gaiden 4 and all of them ran incredibly well. You’ll be able to play pretty much any AAA current game at at least 30 FPS with medium to high settings, and then if you want to crank that FPS up, you just have to lower the resolution or take advantage of FSR and Frame Generation, but given this is again literally a portable PC, you can tinker to your heart is content on a game by game basis, but the chip is more than good enough and just as good as anything else on the market. Again, this is something that is going to get better with the Xbox Ally X with features such as Automatic Super Resolution that uses the NPU to upscale games running at lower resolutions to run a lot better, and there’s another feature called Advanced shader delivery that preloads game shaders during downloads so games launch faster and run smoother which is already in use with Gears of War Reloaded too. Similarly, the battery life will hover at about the two hour mark when playing at that higher 25w performance mode, but you can get anywhere from 5-8 hours when playing on those lower tiers, taking advantage of the great 80wh battery that the ROG Xbox Ally X inherits from the original ROG Xbox Ally. It’s worth mentioning that the ROG Xbox Ally X can also be used when connected to a monitor using any kind of USB-C dock or dongle and then used as a full-fledged PC and similarly, you can also do the same with your TV and have a larger screen gaming experience (although obviously not at 4k for most games), so this is really a versatile device and the category is only going to keep getting better and better. Conclusion The ROG Xbox Ally X is an extremely solid Windows handheld that not only shows the future potential for these handhelds but also the wider potential for the ecosystem that Xbox has been building for some time.

2025-10-24T20:45:06,Halo: Campaign Evolved Hands-On Preview – Reunion Tour,"It might have lost some of its lustre over the course of the last decade, courtesy of Halo Infinite and the Halo TV series, which both came and went, but Halo still deservedly holds icon status within the annals of video game history. Over the course of the original trilogy, it transformed what it meant to be a first-person shooter on console, was a lynchpin in the formation of Xbox Live, and was a global mega-seller and system mover. Despite enjoying anniversary editions in past years, Halo is back again in the form of Campaign Evolved. Rebuilt using Unreal 5, it’s a much prettier version of the original game that defined Xbox’s loud entrance into the market over two decades ago, but it would appear the release is set to come with caveats. Not only is it going to mark the franchise’s first time releasing on PlayStation, based on its title alone, a clever riff on the original’s subtitle, it’s launching without its multiplayer suite. While it’s a shame, I do think the engine room for Halo’s online presence really spun up with its sequel, so spotlighting the game’s tremendous single-player campaign isn’t something I can be mad at. And, of course, the campaign itself can now be experienced in four-player co-op. For the uninitiated, Halo is the game PlayStation tried to “kill” over and over, whether it was Killzone or the venerable Haze taking a shot at the crown, they never could quite box with God. Ironically, in the end, Halo managed to place itself in hospice, but its place as an industry-leading franchise for its time is etched in stone. It’s an epic space opera about a superhuman space marine, Master Chief, being roused from cryosleep amidst mankind’s war against the Covenant only to be jettisoned onto a ring-shaped world, absolutely teeming with allure and mystery. While the Halo campaign is immaculately paced, save for perhaps one mission in particular, I’m glad they opted to show off the game’s fourth mission, The Silent Cartographer, for the purpose of showcasing this remake. It truly is the best of what makes Halo Halo . It opens with a spectacular beachfront landing that feels like the video game equivalent of Normandy before taking on a guided tour of this serene, alien world, all in search of the map room, which is largely considered key to mission success. When considering the changes they’ve made here with Halo, I’m glad they’ve left well enough alone with the moment-to-moment unfolding of the mission itself. The core gameplay tenets, on the other hand, have been modernised, meaning Combat Evolved, like the later Halo games, now has a sprint and trigger-forced aim down sights. As antiquated as it was, I felt that clicking in the right analogue stick was quintessential Halo, and this homogenisation to make it basically play like Call of Duty has left me feeling at odds with the shift. Similarly, I feel as though Master Chief’s legend, as a veritable walking tank, is diminished slightly by having him send it around corridors like a featherweight not wearing a 400-plus kilogram suit of armour. The cynic in me believes the changes are intrinsically tied to an inevitable multiplatform push for a bigger, packaged multiplayer title or suite. I can understand their vision, but from a control scheme standard, nothing played like Halo did, and now Halo, seemingly losing part of itself, plays just like everything else. Although I didn’t get to really experience any of it within the context of this preview, I do like that they’re apparently adding enemies and weapons, like the energy sword, which was first usable in Halo 2, to Campaign Evolved. Even the inclusion of vehicle hijacking should provide a slightly altered routing through some battles that could, in addition to the extra firepower, make parts of the campaign feel more emergent. My mind races about missions like Two Betrayals and Assault on the Control Room. As someone who has a lot of nostalgia for Combat Evolved, I do think that, within the context of the level itself, the updated cinematics feel like almost a step backward, also. I always found the original perspective on the beach entry, seeing it through Chief’s eyes, gave the level’s opening a horrific, grounded feeling that, again, is lost here for the sake of an admittedly cool-looking hero shot. Certain lines of dialogue have also been re-recorded to cater to these reshot cinematics. Jen Taylor’s opening mission brief certainly sounds like a different take when compared to the original. The remainder of the mission audio seems to be intact, so I suspect the decision to redo certain lines was to fit in with the cinematic recut. To be clear, Taylor’s performance is still as perfect as Cortana, but I do hope any other changes are up to her standard. Fortunately, it would appear that Marty O’Donnell’s original score, an integral piece of Halo’s identity, is present throughout, and it still hits as hard thanks to a hefty remaster; from the infamous monk chant to its rock-infused main riff, it stands the test of time as a legendary piece of composition. I’ve established I’m not as thrilled with a couple of the core “upgrades” and modernisations to the control suite, so whether I think Campaign Evolved needs to exist hinges on its visual upgrade via Unreal, after Halo Studio dumped its proprietary engine after Infinite’s player drop-off. Campaign Evolved certainly is pretty. The Silent Cartographer was a fine choice to prove this—it has great environmental variety as you deftly trot back and forth from its scenic beachhead vistas to its machine-like Forerunner installations, which have always had an allure to sci-fi fans. That said, with enough chips in its paintwork, I do think it still falls a few rungs short of other Unreal 5 titles; however, it is a work in progress, and perhaps I’m looking a little closely at things. My interest in Campaign Evolved comes in the form of additional missions that pad out the story. It seems as though these will come in the form of prequel missions, which likely won’t add too much to the canon we don’t already know, but I’m glad they’ll fit within the framework that is the Combat Evolved campaign, which, as I mentioned earlier, is already paced so well. In a world where the Xbox brand could disappear after a single, poor financial quarter, I have to wonder if Campaign Evolved needs to exist. The original game still holds up in my view, and is available within the Master Chief Collection, so I wonder if simply porting that to other platforms might have been the play considered better for business. There’s also the question of why, which stands to question the franchise’s long-term health. Were the last and next potential efforts to expand the Halo empire considered so unconvincing that the only viable option was to retread an already well-worn path? Whatever the reason, we’re getting Halo: Combat Evolved again, and I do anticipate old heads like me, who have reverence for the original, to be at odds with the modernisations. With that said, everything else that makes Halo what it is has been left well enough alone, or made marginally better, so Campaign Evolved could yet prove to be the definitive entry point to the series for those who’ve yet to embark on this most wonderful saga.

As far as characters go, we obviously have Marge and Homer front and centre, Bart and Lisa are riding exoskeletons which should bring them up to the same height as regular characters, and I think Maggie will get that same treatment as we can see her off in the distance getting carried away by Kang and Kodos.

We also get a look at a cel-shaded storm as well, which makes sense given the rest of the game is being given that treatment. As far as the map goes, it’s rumoured that it will keep fully evolving into Springfield as the month rolls on with the first iteration having the Town Square and Nuclear Power Plant, but we can see Moe’s Tavern in addition to the Krust-E-Burger in the key art as well.

2025-10-23T12:59:25,The Outer Worlds 2 Review – A Rift Above the Rest,"While a solid experience all around, 2019’s The Outer Worlds felt like a blueprint for something greater . It combined Obsidian Entertainment’s RPG chops with a novel premise that was and still is unlike anything else in the genre. It’s the kind of title that only Obsidian could deliver, a product of the studio’s learnings and tendencies over some 22 years of developing games. If The Outer Worlds is the blueprint, The Outer Worlds 2 is the end product. A confident and refined RPG that proves Obsidian Entertainment is still one of the best in the business. While there are ties to the first game in the key corporations, factions, and brands of the Halcyon colony, The Outer Worlds 2 takes place in a different colony called Arcadia. Rifts seeping through the very fabric of space and time have cut Arcadia off from Earth, leaving it isolated and vulnerable to corporate and totalitarian exploitation. Your custom character is an agent for the Earth Directorate, an administrative body responsible for coordinating between Earth and the colonies, while also keeping the power-hungry corporations in check. Our journey begins as we venture to the Arcadia colony with a small team to investigate the rifts. Unfortunately, this undercover mission on Horizon Point Station goes awry after being sabotaged, plunging the player character into hibernation. We wake up some years later to an entirely unfamiliar environment. Auntie Cleo’s and Spacer’s Choice have undergone a corporate merger, resulting in Auntie’s Choice, which is in a three-way power struggle with The Order of the Ascendant and the Protectorate. With only a few clues and a ship called the Incognito, our character and his companions set out to explore the Arcadia colony to uncover the truth behind the rifts and what went so wrong on Horizon Point Station. It’s an incredibly strong opening that effortlessly sets the tone of this adventure. Unfortunately, I do think it’s the least consistent aspect of The Outer Worlds 2. Its biggest twists beyond the opening hours are a little too predictable, and the lack of a key antagonistic force until its final hours leads to a narratively rushed final act. It is absurdly flexible when it comes to role-playing, though. Much like the first game, the many directions in which you can take your character can and will shape the way in which the story wraps up. My jack-of-all-trades agent meant I couldn’t interface with a lot of the endgame skill checks necessary for certain endings. It’s an experience dripping with replay value, one that would take many playthroughs to see everything it has to offer. Like the first game, The Outer Worlds 2 nails its world(s) and setting. While the satirical analysis of late-stage capitalism still lies at the beating heart of The Outer Worlds 2, it’s the game’s new factions that really leave an impact. The Order of the Ascendant are faith-based futurists dedicated to solving the enigmatic Universal Equation. They deal in predictions and patterns with mathematical precision in the service of a better tomorrow – even if that tomorrow doesn’t include you. The Protectorate, on the other hand, are a whole other can of worms. If you thought Spacer’s Choice and Auntie Cleo’s from the first game were despicable, just you wait until you see what the Protectorate gets up to. This totalitarian faction holds the most influence in the Arcadia colony, demanding subservience and obedience to their way of life, rules, and beliefs. They’re inflexible in their desire to make their utopia a reality, forcefully shaping its loyal subjects into unfeeling and morally bankrupt individuals who put the idea of the Protectorate above all else. Perhaps it’s a coincidence given the lengthy timelines of game development, but the Protectorate feels all too real set against the backdrop of today’s world. Those who stray from the Protectorate’s ideals are swiftly pulled in line via an ominous process known as Mental Refreshment, corruption spreads like wildfire through its higher ranks, and their general inability to display any level of nuance when confronted with complex situations is scary to say the least. They’re a haunting enemy faction that feels like a natural extension of the themes and ideas explored in the first game. There are so many great characters within these factions – a few of which will join you as companions. While they aren’t made equal, I do think this is a step up over the first game. My undisputed favourite is Tristan Rao, a high-ranking member of the Protectorate who doesn’t quite believe what the Protectorate has been feeding him about the death of his superior. Tristan’s stoic belief in the Protectorate’s ideals is regularly challenged as he accompanies you throughout the Arcadia colony, leading to some poignant character development through his companion quest. Broadly speaking, the writing here is also fantastic. It has the same shrewd sense of humour as the first game, poking fun at capitalist and totalitarian constructs to great effect. Combine this with some similarly great performances across the board, and it’s hard not to try and speak with any and every NPC that will engage in conversation with you. It also continues to throw tough decisions at you, forcing you to weigh up options or maybe even dig a little deeper to see if you can find a better-suited outcome for involved parties. The role-playing systems here have also been heavily iterated upon. Parts have been chopped out of modified, but not in a way that makes The Outer Worlds 2 shallow . Skills have been fundamentally reworked and are immediately easier to understand without compromising on depth, omitting specialised skills entirely in favour of a more traditional RPG framework. Unlockable Perks are no longer dictated by tiers, but instead are made available to you as you put points into their related skills. The brilliant Flaw system also makes a return and feels fully realised here. These continue to analyse your gameplay tendencies and offer you negative traits; only the trade-offs here are much more long-term. Where the first game would give you a perk point if you accepted a Flaw, The Outer Worlds 2 will tie that Flaw to a permanent positive bonus. One Flaw I took early on, for example, gave me an extra skill point per level up, with the concession that each skill I put points into cannot exceed another by more than one point. This is exactly what led to my build becoming a jack-of-all-trades, but other Flaws offer similar fun bonuses that incentivise you to take them on more frequently. Kleptomaniac is another great example, where stolen goods and loot sell for more, but you’re also put into a position where you’ll randomly take items if you so much as glance in their direction. Combine all of this with backgrounds and traits when you create your character, and it’s clear to see that The Outer Worlds 2 promotes player choice above all else. The inability to respec is also a brilliant choice, forcing you to live with your decisions and work within the constraints of your build. THE CURRENT CHEAPEST SHIPPED PRICE IS $89 AT TARGET WITH FREE SHIPPING Combat is also vastly improved here, mostly thanks to new movement options. You can mantle, sprint, double jump, slide, and more, all leading to more kinetic and immediate engagements. Companion abilities no longer have those slow-motion animations tied to them, significantly improving combat pacing overall. You can also choose to play in third-person if your heart so desires, but it does feel somewhat unfinished in its current state. It just feels like the experience hasn’t been designed around it, with stilted animations and awkward camera controls that undermine the other combat improvements. This is a good thing because you’ll often find yourself getting into altercations with all the exploration you’ll be doing. The Outer Worlds 2 again opts for smaller, more dense worlds that are jam-packed with stuff to do. Excellently written sidequests, points of interest, hidden armour and weapons to further flesh out your build, companion mod-kits, and more. Fleshing this out further are permanent unlocks called Gadgets, which you’ll steadily unlock through the main progression and allow for fun environmental puzzle solving and platforming. There’s much more visual diversity on display compared to the first game as well. Early areas like Paradise Island or Golden Ridge share some of the visual design language of the first game, while planets like Cloister and Praetor are exploring new frontiers within the franchise. Cloister is a particular highlight, its surface caked with snow, with monolithic structures that loom large within its perpetual blizzard. Its underground areas stand in opposition to that chaos, offering a serene calm as light refracts through the ice overhead. Everything looks great and runs smoothly for the most part. Series X offers three modes, Quality, Balanced, and Performance, each running at 30, 40, and 60 frames per second, respectively. Each scales dynamically depending on the situation, while making use of upscaling, but I did see some noticeable drops in performance mode when things got particularly busy. I also had a couple of hard crashes and softlocks, which were fixed by loading my most recent save, but still frustrating nonetheless. I’m delightfully surprised at how much I enjoyed The Outer Worlds 2. It may seem that its changes are superfluous or even counter-intuitive to deepening the kind of experience Obsidian Entertainment consistently deliver, but they’re quite the opposite. It’s a truly refined and distilled RPG experience, one we don’t often see in the industry today. It’s an easy recommendation as some of Obsidian’s best work, especially as a day-one Game Pass title. Conclusion If Avowed didn't scratch the RPG itch for you earlier this year, The Outer Worlds 2 surely will. This is a confident and ambitious sequel that feels like Obsidian's vision has been fully-realised. It isn't without many of the issues that plague modern RPGs today, but ultimately makes for an experience that's all too easy to sink many an hour into.

2025-10-23T05:37:16,The Samsung S95F OLED TV’s Glare Free Display Is A Game-Changer For Aussie Living Rooms,"I’ve been using the Samsung S95C OLED for the last 2-3 years and whilst I absolutely love it, my living room is north-facing with an almost full-wall sized window, so during the day glare could always be an issue (especially when filming). This is no longer an issue as I recently updated to the 2025 Samsung S95F OLED TV and it’s been an absolute game-changer with its glare-free display. Obviously, during the day, you no longer get those super clear reflections through the TV especially in darker scenes, but even at night, I no longer have my lamps reflecting back at my through the TV. S95C (Left) vs S95F (Right) Whilst there’s maybe the slightest drop in inky blanks, this is might than made up for by having literally no reflections with how well the new coating diffuses the reflections, and it’s there’s also a boost in brightness in the S95F which makes up for any drop in vibrancy. Whilst in a lot of parts of the world, this probably wouldn’t be an issue, it’s obviously one in Australian living rooms, particularly in Summer. Samsung recently ran surveys and there’s interesting (but not surprising) results that suggest 58% of Australians hate on-screen glare and that 49% draw their curtains during the day to avoid on-screen glare, which is an obvious way to get rid of glare, but I’m personally somebody who would prefer to enjoy natural light whilst playing games, so this allows for the best of both worlds. S95C (Left) vs S95F (Right) As far as glare-free displays from Samsung go, you can find it in the OLED S95F (currently discounted HERE) , the Neo QLED 8K QN990F, Neo QLED 8K QN900F, Neo QLED QN90F, The Frame Pro and The Frame. It’s also in a range of monitors including the G8 OLED which I also use daily and highly recommend especially if you’re using it in a bright office. The thing I appreciate most about Samsung TVs in addition to the glare-free display, and the incredible picture quality that the OLED panel provides is the One Connect box which allows you to just have one power connecting to the TV to provide power and all of your inputs, with the box sitting in your entertainment unit, allowing for a super clean look.

2025-12-17T05:10:15,Batman: Arkham Knight Has Released Another Switch 2 Backwards Compatibility Update,"A Smoother Experience for Batman: Arkham Knight Batman: Arkham Knight has had a complicated journey on Nintendo platforms. When the game launched on the original Switch in 2023, it struggled with performance and stability issues that made the experience far from ideal. While the ambition of bringing such a demanding title to the hardware was clear, the results left many players disappointed. The arrival of the Switch 2, however, has steadily changed that story. Earlier this year, a backwards compatibility update released in November addressed several progression-related problems, making it easier for players to move through the campaign without running into serious roadblocks. Now, WB Games has followed up with another patch, further refining the experience for both Switch and Switch 2 users. According to WB Games Support, the latest update focuses primarily on stability, while also delivering noticeable performance and visual improvements when you play the game in handheld mode on the Switch 2 through backwards compatibility. These changes aim to create a smoother and more reliable experience, particularly for players who prefer to play undocked. The update includes additional stability improvements for Batman: Arkham Knight on the original Switch, helping reduce crashes and other technical interruptions. It also enhances overall stability when the game is played on the Switch 2 via backwards compatibility, building on the progress made in previous patches. On top of that, handheld play on the Switch 2 benefits from further performance tuning and visual upgrades, making Gotham City feel more responsive and visually consistent during gameplay. While Batman: Arkham Knight may never fully escape the limitations of its original Switch release, continued support and targeted updates suggest a clear effort to improve its long-term playability. For players revisiting the game on Switch 2, this latest patch represents another step toward a more polished and dependable experience.

Players also receive 500 Efritanium Crystals as premium currency, the Creepy Charm weapon trinket, and the Katana Watch, a retro-futuristic gadget inspired by classic 1980s Japanese watch designs. Set on a sprawling post-apocalyptic island shaped by the remnants of the Soviet era, PIONER presents an alternate reality built with a strong focus on atmosphere and realism. The open world spans more than 50 square kilometers and is full of hidden dungeons, story-driven quests, and faction-based missions. Blending narrative exploration with high-stakes PvE and PvP combat, the game places player choice at the center. This will allow them to directly shape both the world and its evolving social landscape.

2025-12-17T04:35:33,GORN 2 Has Released a Free Winter Dungeon Brawler Update,"The Dungeons Are Here in GORN 2 GORN 2 expands its bone-crunching combat with a major free update that adds a full Dungeon Brawler mode to the VR fighting epic. Available now on Meta Quest, PS VR2, and SteamVR, the update transforms the familiar arena-based chaos into a savage dungeon-crawling experience shaped entirely around close-range brutality. The new mode sends players deep into randomly generated dungeons built from 25 distinct room types. Each run unfolds differently, pushing players through lava-soaked corridors filled with enemies, traps, and environmental hazards. Combat remains as exaggerated and physical as ever, but now it unfolds across twisting dungeon paths that reward awareness, timing, and raw aggression. New weapons appear throughout each run, encouraging experimentation and making every descent feel unpredictable. Alongside the new mode, the update introduces a strong winter theme that reshapes both combat and level design. Enemies can be frozen solid, turning fights into shattered chaos. Slippery floors alter movement, while icy hazards add a new danger to already hazardous spaces. A collection of winter-themed weapons joins the arsenal, including hockey sticks, pucks, icicle blades, and ice arrows, all designed to match the exaggerated physics for which the series is known. The update also adds new story content and introduces a jump button. This will allow players to leap into the air and strike enemies from above. This small change opens up new combat possibilities and adds verticality to dungeon encounters. GORN 2’s Winter Dungeon Brawler update is available now as a free download on Meta Quest, PS VR2, and SteamVR, offering a colder, harsher take on its signature ultra-violent combat.

2025-12-17T04:26:51,Broken Ranks Just Received Its Trials of the Lodge Update,"A New Challenge Awaits in Broken Ranks Broken Ranks expands its world with Trials of the Lodge, a roguelite-inspired mode that adds a fresh rhythm to the turn-based MMORPG. Available to players level 35 and above, the update introduces a faster-paced and more unpredictable experience designed to break away from familiar weekly routines. Trials of the Lodge centers on repeatable runs built entirely around randomness. Arena layouts, enemy encounters, modifiers, and rewards shift with every attempt. This keeps players alert and forces them to make tactical decisions on the fly. After each victory, players choose how to proceed, shaping their run step by step. The mode supports both solo and party play and is split into five level brackets, making it accessible across different stages of progression. Each arena always features an opponent, but encounters often include additional twists such as buffs, debuffs, special effects, shops, or unique rewards that influence strategy. According to the developers, the goal was to create an experience that remains engaging over time rather than something completed once and left behind. A major highlight of the update is a new progression system tied directly to the Trials. Even unsuccessful runs grant aithars, a special currency used to unlock permanent character enhancements. These upgrades apply both within the mode and across the wider game. Among them are Infusions, a new enhancement type that allows players to strengthen a stat they currently consider their weakest. The update also introduces the Aspect system, which assigns specific traits to stronger enemies. Over time, players can improve their effectiveness against particular enemy types, adding another layer of long-term growth. Entries to the Trials reset weekly, with separate limits for solo and party runs. Alongside experience and psychoexperience, players can earn rare equipment, synergetics, and useful utility items, encouraging regular experimentation and mastery.

2025-12-17T04:18:54,Varthos – Heir to the Throne Launched Today on Steam Early Access,"Enter the Dungeons in Varthos – Heir to the Throne Varthos – Heir to the Throne is now available on Steam in Early Access, marking the arrival of a dark and demanding action RPG from Germany. Set in a world overshadowed by ancient power, the game draws players into a brutal struggle for control of the Throne of the World, where survival depends on skill, timing, and persistence. This roguelite experience is full of intense combat and steady progression. Players face relentless waves of undead and monstrous enemies that push them deeper into a dangerous cycle of battle and rebirth. Defeat is not an endpoint but a turning moment. Each fall teaches valuable lessons, shaping the path of the next warrior who rises to continue the fight. The game’s central idea revolves around legacy. When one hero falls, another awakens to take their place, inheriting progress and strength earned before. Every run builds on the last, creating a sense of forward momentum even in failure. Combat remains unforgiving, demanding precision and awareness, while constant threats ensure that no encounter feels routine. Varthos – Heir to the Throne focuses on creating pressure through atmosphere and mechanics alike. Dark environments, aggressive enemies, and the promise of gradual mastery combine to form a tense and rewarding loop. Advancement is earned through effort, not shortcuts, reinforcing the game’s harsh but fair design. Now in Early Access on Steam, the game invites players to step into a world where every strike carries weight and every defeat fuels the next attempt. There are no retries in the traditional sense, only the rise of the next warrior, stronger and closer to claiming the throne.

The Holiday Update introduces a Christmas-themed escape room packed with playful challenges, clever traps, and lighthearted seasonal chaos. Inspired by classic holiday films such as Home Alone, the new content leans into mischievous design while staying true to the game’s focus on smart problem-solving. The update is available now at no extra cost for all players who own the game. Alongside the new room, Pine Studio has expanded Room Editor 2.0 with a selection of winter and Christmas-themed props. These additions allow creators to design and share their own festive escape rooms, complete with snowy decorations and holiday-inspired puzzles. It further strengthens the game’s already active community-driven content scene. Since launching on 27 October, Escape Simulator 2 has attracted more than 250,000 players and received a strong response from fans of the genre.

In addition, players can explore hundreds of community-made rooms created using the robust editor tools. Escape Simulator 2 supports both solo play and cooperative sessions, with a dedicated lobby room that makes teaming up with friends simple and seamless. Enhanced physics and environmental interactions add to the feeling of stepping into a real escape room, where nearly every object invites experimentation.

2025-12-17T04:01:20,Puzzling Places Just Received Its Free Holiday Update,"Welcome to the World of Puzzling Places Puzzling Places, the well-loved VR jigsaw puzzle game built around detailed 3D dioramas of real-world locations, is celebrating the holiday season with a substantial free update. This release introduces a brand new game mode, a fully redesigned menu, improved hand tracking, refreshed puzzles, and stronger Mixed Reality support. The headline addition is Journey Mode, created for players who enjoy a relaxed, low-effort approach to puzzling. Designed specifically with Mixed Reality and hand tracking in mind, this mode removes the need to manage or rotate large numbers of pieces. It also works well in smaller play spaces. Rather than showing the full puzzle at once, Journey Mode starts with a single central piece. The game then provides small groups of pieces to attach step by step, letting the scene gradually expand outward. This guided structure delivers a steady and calming sense of progression through each location. Hand Tracking 2.0 brings noticeable improvements to responsiveness and precision. Grabbing and releasing pieces feels more reliable, while new fingertip color indicators clearly show interactive elements. Updated tutorials ease new players into the system, and natural gestures such as poking to inspect details, dragging to switch tabs, and tossing pieces back to the wall help interactions feel more intuitive. The in-game menu has also received a complete visual refresh, featuring a brighter color palette and a cleaner layout. The new start screen highlights quick start options, personal puzzle statistics, and curated pack suggestions. Browsing the library is easier thanks to larger thumbnails, and ratings for puzzles and packs are now visible directly in the store. Finally, the update refreshes the base game puzzle selection with popular community favorites. The team has fully remastered four standout puzzles, adding enhanced animations, effects, and sound to deliver a polished first experience for new players.

2025-12-16T14:00:34,COGconnected GOTY 2025 – Best Surprise,"COGconnected GOTY 2025 – Best Surprise Sometimes that beautifully wrapped box surprises you in a bad way by concealing some regifted slippers. But now and then, the surprise is entirely amazing. Or at least positive. Here are 10 of the best gaming surprises from 2025, things we didn’t see coming. You know, like that beat-up box containing a brand-new Nintendo Switch 2. What was your best surprise this year? 10. Dota 2 X Monster Hunter Event The collaborations keep coming. One of the latest and most surprising is the limited time Dota 2 event that pulls in elements like Palicos and monsters from Capcom’s popular franchise. Maybe not quite as exciting as the Simpsons’ Fortnite crossover but a welcome idea nonetheless. 9. Donkey Kong Bananza With new mechanics, a more-than-decent narrative and colorful art, Donkey Kong Banaza managed to turn the heads of fans a little wary of another mediocre Donkey Kong rehash. 8. Nintendo Switch Virtual Boy Announcement Ok, file this one under What the Actual Hell. Just what we need, a Nintendo Switch-based version of an already weird and niche 1995 console add-on that allowed players to experience games in stereoscopic 3D. 7. Digimon Story: Time Stranger Everyone’s heard of Digimon, of course. Pokémon is more ubiquitous but Digimon has legions of fans, too. Digimon Story: Time Stranger might be the game that pulls some attention away from Pokémon, with it’s more mature storyline and characters and excellent turn-based combat. 6. Super Mario Galaxy Movie Announcement Not that anyone was truly surprised, but the Super Mario Galaxy Movie was announced this year, set for April 2026 release. A direct sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the new film features most of the first film’s cast reprising their roles. The only question is, will the Super Mario Galaxy Movie be something more substantial than the first movie. 5. Hollow Knight: Silksong Was Actually Released Waiting for Hollow Knight: Silksong to actually drop has become a favorite (if frustrating) pastime for fans of the original. Well, lo and behold, it actually arrived in 2025 and was an excellent, if exceptionally challenging, successor to the original. 4. Battlefield 6 Beats the Odds Battlefield games have a spotty history, and no one was really expecting Battlefield 6 to be anything but mediocre. While the game’s campaign is a little rote, the multiplayer modes have really taken off. Battlefield 6 is  one of the best and least technically flawed games in the series. 3. Blue Prince is Fire Coming out of nowhere to catch the attention of puzzle game fans is the definition of surprising. Blue Prince combines puzzles, narrative depth, and roguelike replayability into a genuinely unique indie game. 2. Silent Hill f is Different but Awesome Silent Hill f did a lot of new and surprising things, from its setting to its emphasis on arcane Japanese folklore. With some disturbing themes, it leaves gore and horror behind and replaces them with psychological tension and terror. 1. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a Great Indy (not Indie) Game Have you noticed there’s a theme beneath many of our surprises? Games that could have gone wrong, but didn’t. There have a been a lot of Indiana Jones-related games, but none have captured the cinematic excitement and Indy charisma as much as The Great Circle.

2025-12-16T12:30:47,Arknights: Endfield is a Genuine Surprise,"Arknights: Endfield Preview If you’re a fan of tower defense games you might have played 2020’s Arknights. It was a free-to-play gacha game with puzzle elements, an engaging and unique take on the tower defense genre. Arknights: Endfield shares a few strands of DNA with the original game, but mostly it’s a surprising and impressive departure. Combining an anime-inspired action RPG with a Satisfactory-like building sim wasn’t on my bingo card. So, What is It? Arknights: Endfield takes place in the same fictional universe as the first game, but on a new earth-like planet called Talos II. You play as the “Endministrator” (or Edmin) of the Endfield corporation, and your tasks are twofold. First you need to beat back the supernatural Corruption, criminal factions and monsters on the planet. Second, you need to industrialize Talos-II for its valuable resources, which also help you level up. Let me just say that the English voice acting in Arknights: Endfield is surprisingly strong. Unfortunately, the narrative and script are an absolute morass of made-up jargon, acronyms and lore. Hours in and I was still bewildered by the story’s details. Luckily, most of it doesn’t get in the way of either the action or the other game play loops. Next level Arknights; Endfield has three primary components: combat, exploration and base building, plus the gacha mechanics. However, the don’t all necessarily take up the same amount of time. Players looking for a predominantly action-RPG-focused game might be disappointed. Combat in Arknights: Endfield is a variation on familiar ideas. You can have up to four characters (out of at least 20)  in your squad, and you can switch at will between them in real time. When not being controlled, the AI does a decent job at surviving the encounter. But the big hook is the way each character’s abilities and special attacks synergize. Your main task in combat is to optimize and build up various meters in order to unleash powerful attacks, alone or in combination with the team. Combat is fast, flashy, fun and frenetic. It takes a while to click, just like everything in the game. There are dodges and perfect dodges and weapons feel impactful. The combat experience generally feels extremely well polished and could easy carry the game. Another Day at the Factory Combat is only one element, however. Exploration is important, too, as it allows you to gather resources for upgrades and complete mission objectives. Hand in hand with exploration, building a range of towers, power grids, transportation nodes and processing factories will take up hours of time. The early hours of Arknights: Endfield are focused on narrative and combat, but soon you’ll need to start laying down a grid to power various towers, and zip lines that will make traveling through the zone easier. One exciting feature is that while Arknights: Endfield is a single player game, you’ll be able to use structures set down by other players (not unlike in Death Stranding). As the game progresses, your constructions become more elaborate. Eventually you will be building entirely factories in order to process minerals and other resources you collect on Talos-II. Building also means power management and you’ll need to connect to a new or existing power grid. While maybe not quite as densely featured as Factorio or Satisfactory, the construction sim elements in Arknights: Endfield are complex and will take hours and a lot of trial and error to grasp. Triple-A Aspirations There’s no getting around Arknights: Endfield’s gacha mechanics, which primarily exist for premium weapons, armor and cosmetics. Whether players want to engage with it or not, the grind for either currency and more pulls or simply to level up outside the gacha is real. It might take a long time to get there, but at some point most folks will probably invest some real world coin just to make things a little easier. At least on the PC, Arknights: Endfield looks pretty impressive, especially when it comes to animations, lighting and combat effects. The environments look good too, if just a little lacking in textural detail. Characters are typical anime/waifu creations but cheekily acknowledge when the camera lingers a little too long on one body part or another. I have no idea how it will look on mobile devices but Arknights: Endfield feels like a polished product on PC and runs accordingly. Arknights: Endfield did something very few games have done lately: it surprised me. A total departure from the first game, Arknights: Endfield offers dozens of hours of content that’s split between almost two entirely different game genres. On the combat action-RPG side, there’s a lot to enjoy thanks to the way abilities work together. When it comes to exploration and building, there’s an equal amount of material to explore. Maybe most surprising of all is that the pieces all logically fit together. I’m definitely interested in seeing how gamers respond to Arknights: Endfield, and how it develops. ***PC code provided by the publisher for preview*** The post Arknights: Endfield is a Genuine Surprise appeared first on COGconnected .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.100661,Mark Steighner,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/preview/arknights-endfield-preview/,4f0b4079803e547b6f48b38e8523c1d7ab56d239,1432,en,0.1,"Arknights: Endfield Preview If you’re a fan of tower defense games you might have played 2020’s Arknights.

2025-12-16T12:26:49,Yakuza Kiwami 2 (PS5) Review – The Series’ Best Story,"Yakuza Kiwami 2 (PS5) Review Yakuza/ Like a Dragon is one of my favorite video game series of all time. The original two Yakuza games were released for the PS2, and the series remained fairly niche until the sixth mainline game, Yakuza 0 , came out on the PS4. After the success of Yakuza 0, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio remade the first two games in the series as Yakuza Kiwami 1 + 2. In 2025, Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut was released as a Switch 2 exclusive. Yakuza Kiwami 3 was also announced for early 2026. To capitalize on the success these latest releases, Sega has remastered Yakuza Kiwami 2 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The new update is free for owners of the original version. If you already own the original version of Yakuza Kiwami 2 there’s no new content for this current gen release. There are minor performance upgrades because of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S hardware being stronger than the PS4. This review will give an overview for what newcomers can expect from the Yakuza games. I will discuss differences between the Kiwami and original game. Kiryu vs. Goda The first seven mainline Yakuza games are the story of Kazuma Kiryu, a legendary Japanese gangster. Yakuza Kiwami 2 takes place after the events of Kiwami 1. I don’t want to give away too many details, because almost any character info would spoil the plot of Kiwami 1. But the driving narrative is about a gang war between the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance. The Omi are led by Ryuji Goda, who is arguably still the series’ greatest villain. Yakuza Kiwami 2’s plot is arguably the best in the series, and Goda is Kiryu’s most equal physical rival. The Yakuza games all have incredibly cinematic narratives. There are lots of cutscenes every story chapter, and they are incredibly well-directed. I would seriously put them alongside any great film or series. One of the main draws of these games is getting to experience such well-told stories. Shot-For-Shot Recreation The cutscenes in Yakuza Kiwami 2 are shot-for-shot exactly the same as the original PS2 game. Some of the characters have changed in appearance, but all the framing, camera work, and mise-en-scene are identical. Although there are loads of cutscenes to watch in every chapter of each game, the core gameplay is an open world third person action game. The majority of each of these games takes place in a fictional Japanese red-light district called Kamurochō, modelled (in great detail) after Kabukichō, a real-life red-light district of Shinjuku. The sandbox is so accurate and vibrant that the series has become known as a virtual Japanese vacation sim. Tourists activity visit the real-life counterparts of areas in the Yakuza games. Fighting in the Streets As Kiryu roams the streets he gets into fights. A lot of Yakuza Kiwami 2’s gameplay involves third person battles. Kiryu has multiple attack buttons, and unlocks more abilities as the games progress. Battles often involve grabbing environmental weapons, and performing cinematic QuickTime attacks. As the series goes on, the games develop more RPG elements. Kiwami 1 is built on the Yakuza 0 engine, and they’re lighter on RPG progression. But Kiwami 2 is built on the Yakuza 6 engine, and that’s where the RPG aspects really began to take over. A huge part of Yakuza Kiwami 2’s appeal is the incredible amount of stuff to do in the sandbox. Kiryu can walk into lots of buildings. Every street corner involves a potential new sidequest or minigame to play. There are multiple casinos, and gambling parlors, with lots of different games. Arcades have full versions of classic Sega games. The side quests get weird and can involve strange scenarios, like rooms of grown men in diapers asking for assistance. They’re a wacky contrast to the very serious crime drama that takes place in the main narrative. Extra Majima Content Yakuza Kiwami 2 adds a lot of content to make it match up with later games. It even has a whole separate scenario starring Majima as a playable character. Unfortunately, there’s a whole section of Yakuza 2 that takes place in a second district called Sotenbori. The playable section of Sotenbori was cut from Kiwami 2 for budgetary reasons. The events of the story still play out, and Sotenbori is featured in cutscenes, but there’s no sandbox to explore. This is a real shame, but likely won’t be noticed by anyone who hasn’t played the original. The Yakuza/ Like a Dragon series has become one of the most beloved video game franchises on the planet. They’re a combination of cinematic crime drama, fun third person brawl combat, deep open world exploration, and insanely wacky sidequests and minigames. Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the best version of the second game in the series. Cutting the Sotenbori is a major loss, but the new content more than makes up for its omission. Overall this is an excellent version of an all-time great video game. ***PS5 code provided by the publisher*** The post Yakuza Kiwami 2 (PS5) Review – The Series’ Best Story appeared first on COGconnected .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.101653,Stephan Adamus,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/yakuza-kiwami-2-ps5-review/,56875c7a9583f1c8f86de4d26cd32bfcf3a2cf94,1433,en,0.1,"Yakuza Kiwami 2 (PS5) Review Yakuza/ Like a Dragon is one of my favorite video game series of all time.

2025-12-16T11:41:05,Blue Prince Brings Its Award-Winning Puzzle Experience on Mac App Store Today,"A Unpredictable Journey Awaits in Blue Prince Raw Fury and developer Dogubomb have released Blue Prince on the Mac App Store, bringing the acclaimed puzzle adventure to a wider audience. The Swedish indie publisher confirmed that this release sits alongside the existing Mac version available on Steam. This will finally allow more players to explore the shifting halls of Mt. Holly for the first time. Blue Prince originally launched in April on PC via Steam and Windows, followed by releases on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Since its debut, the game has emerged as one of the highest reviewed titles of the year on Metacritic. It earned widespread critical praise along with multiple perfect and near-perfect scores. Its strong reception has also translated into industry recognition, with wins and nominations from major award bodies such as the Golden Joystick Awards, The Game Awards, and The Indie Games Awards, in addition to a longlisting at the BAFTA Games Awards. Blue Prince blends mystery, strategy, and puzzle design into a carefully constructed yet unpredictable experience. The game is set within Mt. Holly, a strange and ever-changing manor where the layout shifts as players progress. Each chamber offers distinct mechanics, secrets, and obstacles, encouraging careful planning and thoughtful decision-making with every step forward. Players must chart their own route through the manor in search of the elusive Room 46. No two runs unfold in quite the same way, as room placement and available paths continually reshape the journey.

2025-12-16T11:31:38,RuneScape: Dragonwilds Just Got Its First Major Free Update,"Farming Skill Also Debuts in RuneScape: Dragonwilds Fellhollow, the first major free update for RuneScape: Dragonwilds, is now available, inviting players into a haunting new region shaped by decay and corruption. This substantial expansion introduces fresh quests, dangerous enemies, a massive boss encounter, and a striking realm suspended between life and death. In this update, Death guides players as a new questgiver and companion, leading them through mist-filled valleys, dead forests, ruined structures, and landscapes overtaken by the Wither Rot. This spreading corruption reshapes exploration and survival, introducing rot-afflicted enemies, environmental threats, and a powerful new status effect called Soul Rift. As exposure to the Wither Rot increases, Soul Rift alters combat, exploration, and progression. New armour sets and consumables crafted from Fellhollow materials help resist its effects, while carefully managing exposure unlocks powerful abilities. Rift Sight reveals hidden paths, spectral doors, and secrets invisible to the living, while Imaru’s Gaze draws the attention of Fellhollow’s apex predator, Imaru the Soul Eater. Once the guardian dragon of the region, Imaru has been transformed by grief into a terrifying, soul-devouring creature. As Death searches for a champion to end her curse, players continue the Kuldra Saga storyline through an epic, multi-phase boss battle against this corrupted dragon. The update also introduces the Farming Skill to RuneScape: Dragonwilds. Inspired by classic RuneScape systems but reimagined with a magical focus, farming adds new depth to survival from the earliest stages of the game. Mounts arrive alongside this update as well, beginning with the Terrorbird, unlockable through a Fellhollow questline. With more regional expansions planned for 2026, Fellhollow sets the foundation for the future of RuneScape: Dragonwilds, now available on Steam Early Access .

2025-12-16T11:27:53,ReStory Turns Broken Tech Into Cozy Satisfaction,"ReStory Preview I don’t know how the old cell phone accumulated dirt and gunk on the inside of its case, but it’s my job to clean it. The guy above my shop just asked me to repair an old Atari controller, and the local cop needs his flashlight fixed. This is my life in ReStory, an upcoming cozy repair sim. Tinkering Around ReStory is set in the early 2000s, so you won’t be repairing the latest iPhone or tablet. Instead, the Y2K-era items are sort of on the cusp of an entirely digital world. This means there are lots of things to take apart, wires to fix, screws to unscrew, and bad switches to replace. You have a little 3D shop on a busy Japanese street. Interactions with customers, the local neighborhood folks, like the landlord, are done via static screens and dialogue trees. At day’s end, you’ll hop on your bike and go home. Pleasant enough. But the repairs pile up, and sometimes, you’re short on cash. Maybe you need to raise your repair costs. Every repair job has multiple stages, from disassembly to cleaning to repairs. To clean a piece of gear, you simply brush it off, giving you serious Power Wash Simulator vibes. Sometimes you have to reuse parts from one item to the next. ReStory rarely makes you do much thinking, as it gives you a check sheet for almost every task. It won’t let you accidentally skip something or do it out of order. Ironically, ReStory Needs Some Repairs, Too I had the opportunity to put an early demo of ReStory on the workbench. Unsurprisingly, it had a few issues with things like disappearing parts. The game’s interface is a little wonky. For example, enlarging a piece of gear to examine it covers other items on the desk. Sometimes the game is clear about where parts go, sometimes not. Options are pretty bare-bones when it comes to visuals, and there’s no controller support. Still, despite some rough edges, ReStory’s gameplay gives that chill, orderly satisfaction that the genre is known for. The economic sim aspect is pretty basic, and the writing and characters aren’t exactly attention-grabbing. But cleaning something in a game always feels good, and taking things apart and rebuilding them taps into some deep crevice of the brain. From the demo, it’s hard to tell how complex the repair tasks eventually become, or if there’s ever a little more player agency in approaching them. The cozy cleaning sim niche always has room for another good game. Thanks to its nostalgia for older, classic tech, ReStory claims a unique spot. I’m looking forward to seeing what other dirty, broken, and outdated junk comes over the counter when the game releases. *** PC code provided for preview*** The post ReStory Turns Broken Tech Into Cozy Satisfaction appeared first on COGconnected .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.105125,Mark Steighner,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/preview/restory-preview/,de032324698f2c57e6a680e18283c609a37548cd,1437,en,0.1,"ReStory Preview I don’t know how the old cell phone accumulated dirt and gunk on the inside of its case, but it’s my job to clean it.

2025-12-16T11:23:41,Sports Card Shop Simulator Opens Its Steam Store Page,"Welcome to the Sports Card Shop Simulator OverPowered Team, working alongside publisher Squeaky Wheel, has launched the Steam Store page for Sports Card Shop Simulator. It is an upcoming management game designed around the culture and craft of sports card collecting. Built for collectors, traders, and sports fans alike, the title aims to combine the familiarity of card shops with deeper, system-driven gameplay. In Sports Card Shop Simulator, players take control of their own card store. They must guide it from a small operation into a thriving business. The experience blends the nostalgia of opening packs with modern shop management mechanics. All while allowing players to make smart decisions in a constantly shifting market. Players can buy, sell, grade, trade, customize, and auction cards, while prices and demand continue to evolve. Every choice impacts the shop’s reputation, profits, and long-term growth. The game features a standout custom card creation system that lets players design their own sports cards. They can also add them directly to the game’s card pool, rather than keeping them confined to a separate editor. They can appear naturally in packs during regular gameplay, turning each opening into a personal and unpredictable moment. This system allows players to craft their ideal dream pulls, share creations with others, and build a collection that feels truly individual. “While TCGs lead the market in collectible cards these days, sports cards collection has a long and treasured history, and its fans are not being served by other games.” said Ryan Sumo of Squeaky Wheel. “The idea of pulling your own card out of a pack is such a cool concept, and we want to be the only game that can give this feeling to players” said Pablo Monroy of OverPowered Team.

Blending fast-paced combat with time travel and cooperative play, the game brings together knights, mechs, and shapeshifters in a constantly shifting multiverse. Often referred to by its early community as the Multiplayer Megabonk, Out of Time focuses on chaotic team-based battles where coordination and adaptability define success. Each match delivers a tightly paced 15-minute run filled with escalating threats, unpredictable events, and powerful enemies pulled from different eras of history and the future. Following an extensive testing phase shaped by tens of thousands of players, the Steam launch marks a major step forward for the game. Alongside new platforms, Manticore Games is introducing fresh content, including the Solar Punk Era, which expands the universe even further. According to CEO Frederic Descamps, Out of Time was built as an endlessly expandable experience. Using Core, Manticore’s own UGC platform built on Unreal, the team can rapidly add new features, eras, and systems. This approach allows the game to grow at a fast pace, with more updates already planned for the coming year. The newly added Solar Punk Era introduces four expansive zones, new enemy types, additional playable classes such as the Solar Sentinel and Head of Hydroponics, four large-scale bosses, and a range of new random in-game events. With its blend of roguelite structure, cooperative intensity, and era-hopping chaos, Out of Time now invites a wider audience to jump into its ever-evolving universe on Steam and the Steam Deck.

2025-12-16T08:01:54,Online Casinos in Perth: How to Choose the Best and Stay Safe While Playing,"Perth is home to one of the best casinos in Australia and beyond, called Crown Casino. It’s a massive resort that works 24/7, and provides top-tier pokies and table games. So you might wonder why bother with online play, considering that licensed Australian operators cannot legally offer online casino games due to the Interactive Gambling Act (2001). Online gambling sites that Aussies can access are not monitored or regulated by the nation’s gambling commissions. So, they aren’t considered as safe as retail options. That said, finding a trustworthy and reliable online casino in Perth is still possible if you turn to reviews by gambling experts. In essence, these are people who actively test internet casinos to find which ones legitimately care about their players and want to do things by the book. Here we will go over some of these methods that you can use yourself, and check whether a gambling operator is to be trusted or not. Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Casino Anyone who wants to have a good time playing online casino games should keep these things in mind: Is the casino licensed? – Many offshore gambling commissions have adopted security standards similar to those in the EU and the US, so those licenses indicate the site is safe. Software providers – Hosting games from renowned studios means you’ll have more fun options for gambling, and it also means you are playing games certified for fairness. Supported payment systems – It’s a lot safer to use payment methods like Neosurf or crypto when playing on these sites. Also, sites that allow transactions through e-wallets tend to have faster payout processing. Available responsible gambling tools – Features like deposit limit, reality check, time-out, or self-exclusion come in handy when you are trying to be more disciplined with your spending. Bonuses – Always check what bonuses you can use and whether rollover terms are easy to meet. This allows you to get significantly more value out of each payment. Usually, information on all of these things can be found on the site, but you can also contact customer support to verify it and to check how responsive they are in general. Licensing and Regulation for Safe Gambling The main issue when it comes to playing on a site that’s not regulated locally is that your consumer protection laws won’t apply. However, a casino that is licensed by another commission still needs to respect the laws and requirements of that country. Curacao Gaming Board, as well as Anjouan Gambling Comission, have adopted some of the licensing and regulatory criteria from MGA and UKGC. They might not have the same rules when it comes to advertising, blanket self-exclusion, and spending limits, but they do keep up in other respects. Licensed sites have their own self-exclusion mechanisms, and licensed casino needs to use provably fair games and need to keep their funds and player funds separate. This is a useful precaution that, in a way, guarantees your winnings are safe. Finally, the platform itself needs to use industry-standard or SSL encryption, which means your personal data is protected. What’s more, it’s possible to report it for malpractice and have it fined or its license suspended. So, even if they can “scam” it’s still in their interest not to get fined. Popular Payment Methods for Perth Players The main pain point of using offshore sites is cross-border payments. These are slow and tend to be expensive, so withdrawals tend to take weeks in some cases. Clearly, this leads to erosion of trust, and online casinos often incentivize the use of crypto payments. It’s an elegant way to bypass these problems and to even deposit smaller amounts if you don’t fully trust a certain operator. If you don’t have a crypto wallet, pick a site that accepts vouchers like Neosurf. You can add funds without leaving your card or bank information on the site and then withdraw your funds using another method. Brands that really want to localize their sites for the Australian market also accept PayID, allowing you to add funds via one of the safest and most popular payment methods in the region. Lastly, AstroPay, GPay, ApplePay, Skrill, and regular card payments are all solid and fast processing options. So, it won’t be difficult to find brands that accept those. Tips for Responsible Gambling We mentioned earlier how picking a casino that is equipped with responsible gambling tools will be highly useful. This will allow you to have better control over this habit as you can set the limits right off the bat. This way, even if you are tempted to overstep the established boundaries, you won’t be able to do so. Moreover, you can stop yourself from losing additional funds through the loss limit feature. In essence, once you’ve spent the set volume of cash on losing bets, you become unable to play further for the rest of the day or week. Finally, if you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling, or if the hobby becomes too stressful, just go for a time-out. You set how many days or weeks you don’t want to play, and until the lockout expires, you cannot log in. All of these tools are mandatory in modern and licensed casinos, and they’ve been proven to be effective in stopping gambling problems. How to Avoid Online Casino Scams Now, there are operators out there who are indeed out to get you. They might look legitimate and even let you cash out your winnings. But the moment you hit a big win, they start to ghost you. To be sure that you can trust an online casino, you should read reviews from other players on sites like Reddit and Trustpilot. See if those reviews are recent and if the casino attempted to address the issue. You should also be careful when checking the license because some sites display fake certificates on their home page. You can usually spot irregularities in the link that displays the license, as it will likely have a slightly different domain name (a letter mismatch compared to the original site). Alternatively, you’ll download a PDF that looks like a license but doesn’t have an actual number you can run and check. Always check the official register and see if their brand name is on the list of casinos that currently have an active license. Finally, remember to start with small deposits and to withdraw your funds as fast as possible to check if the payment will go through. Most casinos have a minimum withdrawal policy of 20 AUD – 50 AUD, so do this the moment you have enough funds.

2025-12-16T05:37:15,Scared by Squares Has Introduced a New Game Mode Called Escape the Grid,"Face a New Danger in Scared by Squares Scared By Squares has introduced a new game mode called Escape the Grid, inviting players into the unsettling world with a fresh challenge. This mode reshapes the experience into a tense, randomized journey where every decision carries weight and every door can lead to danger. Escape the Grid places players inside a 25-room layout arranged as a shifting grid. Each room presents a unique trial, ranging from environmental hazards to precision-based movement challenges. One room within the grid is corrupted, blocking progress until it is properly cleansed. To overcome this obstacle, players gain access to a new item called the shape stabilizer, a tool designed specifically to neutralize corruption and restore balance to the grid. As players move deeper into the mode, they must remain alert. Deadly cubes patrol certain areas, anomalies can be collected to improve performance, and a sense of constant instability hangs over the entire run. The objective is simple in concept but demanding in execution. Cleanse the corrupted space, survive the dangers, and escape before the run collapses entirely. The developers have also outlined an ambitious roadmap for future updates. Planned additions include dynamic room shuffling, timed challenges, expanded anomaly systems that reward higher scores, new room types, multiplayer support, and further content aimed at increasing replayability. Scared By Squares itself is an atmospheric VR exploration game that gives out uneasy vibes using minimalism. Players traverse liminal environments filled with cubes that feel both mechanical and alive. Survival depends on observation, careful movement, and the ability to identify anomalies before the final chance at freedom disappears. Scared By Squares is available on Meta Quest headsets and Steam. You can also enjoy the game in the standard mode in the Steam version.

The update, titled Stories Untold, continues to build on the game’s bleak atmosphere while opening up new corners of the Chornobyl Anomalous Zone. According to details shared on the PlayStation Blog , the new storyline begins with an emergency transmission that draws players toward the western edge of the Zone. This unexplored area introduces seven new locations, six new characters, and several hours of additional gameplay. GSC Game World encourages players to focus on the Red Forest region. Here, careful observation and sound judgment will shape how events unfold. Notable locations within the area include the eerie Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the long-abandoned Old Mine, both of which offer narrative threads and environmental storytelling. The update also expands Stalker 2’s arsenal. Alongside the game’s existing lineup of more than 30 weapons, players will gain access to the GP37V2 rifle. Designed for tactically skilled players, the rifle favors precision over raw firepower. It does not support full automatic fire, but can be used in burst or single-shot modes. The weapon comes equipped with a suppressor and a low magnification scope, rewarding careful aim and calculated engagement. Beyond story and combat additions, Stories Untold introduces a new hub area in the Burnt Forest. This space allows players to meet NPCs and safely store equipment. Several existing locations will also feel more alive, with other Stalkers returning to inhabit the Zone.

2025-01-30T16:00:41,Hello Kitty Island Adventure Switch review,"It’s been a while since I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and with its arrival on Switch, I was more than happy to dive in once more. It’s not common for me to play anything as cute as this. Sure, I played the hell out of Animal Crossing New Horizons, but I never thought I would love Sunblink’s life sim quite as much as I did. Since it came out, I’ve purchased two Tuxedo Sam plushies and been gifted figurines of the guy. It’s pure and good and innocent, and the world needs more games like this. Not only is it sweeter than candy, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is also a really good game. I reviewed the mobile version back in 2023, and much of the game is exactly the same as it was back then. You can read my thoughts on that , but as for the Switch version, it looks magnificent on the OLED screen. When docked, I did have a few issues with temporarily freezing while exploring the island, but for the majority of my time it ran rather well. After diving out of an aeroplane alongside Hello Kitty and friends, you’re introduced to the mechanics straight away. You don’t feel as empty as you did when sleeping in your tent in Animal Crossing, and while you don’t start off with somewhere to live, there’re plenty of quizzes to get stuck into. That’s the focus here. Quests are never few and far between, and while you do have quite a lot of fetch quests to do, meeting a range of characters from the Sanrio franchise and getting to interact with them never gets old. For those who want to explore the concept of escapism and cozy gaming more deeply — especially in the context of identity, creativity, and player interaction — services like bachelorarbeit schreiben lassen can help structure these ideas into an academic framework. There’s always lots to do, whether buying a gift for islanders that match their personality, craft some new items or get a house ready for a visitor, explore the secrets of the island or help out a friend in need. Animal Crossing never really featured quests as such, but Hello Kitty Island Adventure is full of them. It’s never a dull moment on the island, and doing it all as your own customised and individual character makes it so much fun just chilling under the beautiful sun. As you play throughout the year, the island changes to match the seasons, and there’s always something beautiful to set your eyes upon. It also has a range of minigames and puzzles to participate in, giving it more variety than other life sims around. Getting to play without the confines of an Apple device means playing on a big screen from the sofa helps to maintain that cosy feel you get from fishing, gardening, or playing on this gorgeous island. Hello Kitty Island Adventure on the Switch is giving players a chance to finally get their hands on one of the biggest surprises of the last five years. While it may not be as good as games like Animal Crossing, it never tries to copy or replicate. In fact, it does a lot of things better, and offers a ton of content for you to do every single day you play. If you love the cute mascots of Sanrio and want to exist in a world with colourful characters like Kerropi, Cinnamoroll, and Badtz-Maru, there’s no better Hello Kitty experience than this.

2025-01-30T15:00:25,Laika: Aged Through Blood review,"I haven’t played a Metroidvania quite as smart as Laika: Aged Through Blood . While it’s punishing, it is also more rewarding than most. Once you understand and respect the physics, the satisfaction from utilising every trick in the book and using them to brutalise enemies on the back of your motorbike is unmatched. It’s story is dark yet emotional, powerful and intense, but through it all, I haven’t been this addicted to a game’s mechanics in a long time. Get ready to have your world rocked by one of the coolest video games of the era. It’s hard not to be moved by the story of Laika, a mother who will do anything to protect her daughter, her people, and her village from the dangerous and cruel Birds, an army that threatens everything you love. It is this focus that leads you on a path to cut down everyone that stand in your way. The difference is, you’re not journeying across the wastes on foot. Laika: Aged Through Blood sees you travel everywhere on the back of your motorcycle, and it is this difference that makes its gameplay so refreshing. For those who want to explore the connection between emotional storytelling and mechanical complexity in modern video games — especially within academic analysis — the service hausarbeit schreiben lassen can help frame such insights through structured research and interpretation. Everything you do requires utter precision. You’re going to die a lot in the first few hours, and even then the game ramps up the challenge so that the timing on inputs is always so tight. Mastering all the controls will leave you messing up a seemingly simple section over and over again, but damn, when the various mechanics start to click, you end up feeling like John Wick on the back of a bike. The driving physics are akin to the Trials series, and landing on both wheels takes a bit of practice. Not only are you trying to get the momentum of your landings right, you’ve got enemies firing their weapons at you. You can parry shots by sliding you bike towards the bullet at the right time, but to parry again, you’ll need to land a front flip off a ramp to store another one. Laika can shoot at enemies, however, when your bullets run out, a back flip is the only way you’ll be able to reload. You can block shots from enemies by angling your bike in the air so they shoot the bottom of it, but again, you need to get your positioning right. The option to slow time time and fire a well placed shot or get in the right spot for a landing helps somewhat, so you do have a range of options for however you take on a particular set piece. It is when you’re trying to put everything together that Laika: Aged Through Blood becomes challenging. Luckily, checkpoints never feel too far apart, and while you will find certain areas frustrating, succeeding and familiarising yourself with what you’re allowed to do more than makes up for it. As you progress, you’ll use new weapons and unlock powerful abilities, but even if you didn’t, there’s something so addictive about the controls. I was constantly left mesmerised by the way I managed to pull off a chain of feats that seemed impossible at the beginning. Laika: Aged Through Blood is a modern Metroidvania masterpiece, and while many might turn off in the first hour or so due to the complexities of its mechanics, the nuances in its systems continue to blow your mind and keep you wired into its wonder. The soundtrack is strikingly sombre yet beautiful, and it compliments the subject matter and story perfectly. I could happily listen to it outside of playing, and I was always excited to hear what played next. The hand-drawn characters and environments are also stunning, even when the screen is soaked in blood and dead bodies. I’m in awe of everything this game is, and the soundtrack and visuals are the icing on the cake. Laika: Aged Through Blood is an excellent Metroidvania that does things with its controls that few games manage to do. It creates a fresh approach to the genre and does so with the utmost precision. It will certainly frustrate you, but if you’re willing to hang on to the handlebars and refuse to let go, the story of Laika and her quest for vengeance will keep you engrossed throughout. If you love a challenge that pushes the boundaries, get ready to have your mind blown.

2025-01-29T17:00:24,Rift of the NecroDancer review,"Rhythm games come in all shapes and sizes, but where my personal journey started with the genre was Guitar Hero . As a youngster with paper round money burning a hole in his pocket, that plastic guitar was simply impossible to resist. I spent years trying to become a rock god across various entries in this franchise, and so did thousands and thousands of other fans. Rift of the NecroDancer brings me back to those wonderful lazy days of strumming, with a rhythm game that initially seems straightforward and then before you know it beats the snot out of you. Despite being a game focused heavily on timing button presses to the beat to get a high score, there’s actually a story mode in Rift of the NecroDancer. When dragged into another dimension by a portal (or rift, I suppose) our hero Cadence can only survive by taking down the monsters within with the power of music. There are loads of other characters who find themselves trapped in this world too, be they friendly faces from Cadence’s past or long since defeated foes, and only by working together will you all escape to the real world. Playing through the story mode is a nice way to get to grips with the game by playing the songs in an ideal order, and although not the most sweeping emotional narrative, the story scenes are charming enough that they never feel intrusive. The actual gameplay of Rift of the NecroDancer will feel immediately familiar to even passing rhythm game fans. There’s a line at the bottom of the screen, and “notes” that come from the top of the screen that you need to hit when they reach that line. This is all done in time to banging tunes of course, which helps you reach that wonderful trance state where only rhythm exists. Where Rift of the NecroDancer differs from those well known rhythm games of the past is the notes, which are actually little fantasy enemies. Each enemy type has its own rules to hit it correctly, from simple green slimes that just require a button press, to skeletons that once hit will lose their head on run backwards away from the line until stopped by another note. For those who want to explore how game mechanics evolve within genre hybrids and influence user experience — especially from an academic angle — the service ghostwriter hausarbeit can be a helpful tool for building structured, well-researched work on such interdisciplinary topics. It’s a wild twist that completely changes how you play the game, requiring you to think ahead just as much as feel the rhythm. As you progress the enemy types only get more wild too, like bats that change lanes when hit, or giant skulls that spawn skeletons when hit based on the direction they’re facing. I won’t pretend it doesn’t take a bit of practice (and a few fairly lengthy tutorials) to get to grips with all these different foes, but once you do it adds a layer to a usually more basic rhythm game setup I really appreciated. You’ll spend the vast majority of your time in Rift of the NecroDancer taking on new and more fast paced songs, and if you’re anything like me you’ll die a few times on the tougher ones. In each song you start with ten HP, and missing a note will cause you to lose one of those precious hit points. There are some food “notes” you can hit on the lanes to heal you which can mitigate your damage, and you can also use a power meter you build up to enter a mode which doubles your multiplier and causes you to take no damage (which is particularly handy when you approach a tricky section of a song). Using every survival tool at your disposal is key when facing the traps and tricks this game likes to throw at you, especially if you stubbornly refuse to drop below medium difficulty like me. Outside of the standard stages, Rift of the NecroDancer also likes to throw minigames and bosses at you throughout the story. The minigames are a lot of fun, and are reminiscent of the silly little rhythmic tasks thrown at you in the Rhythm Heaven games. Boss fights however are a little less impressive, swapping the regular note line and enemies with circular notes that are harder to track. Thankfully there are only a handful of these to play, as they are way worse than everything else the game has to offer. It’s worth mentioning the sheer amount of content Rift of the NecroDancer contains, because it’s pretty damn impressive. There are a ton of songs to play and unlock in the game, all of which have four difficulty levels to try and survive. It will take many many hours to master this offering, and even then thanks to Steam Workshop support there are custom songs to download too. Even pre-release I was able to download a Billy Hatcher tune, and an Undertale song, and I can only imagine that the selection will grow exponentially in the next few months. Without fantastic music a rhythm game would be miserable to play no matter how well made it was, and fortunately that isn’t the case here. With a long list of artists but headlined by Danny Baranowsky (composer of Super Meat Boy , The Binding of Isaac and Crypt of the NecroDancer) the tracks are as varied as they are enjoyable to play along to. Soundtracks simply don’t get better than this. I had a splendid time with this superb rhythm game, but it does have a few issues. The most prominent of these is just how hard it is to master, with certain elements like offbeat enemies really posing a problem to me. The controls (if you’re using a controller) don’t particularly help with this either, and it does feel designed for keyboard inputs mainly. You can use either the top three directions of the D-pad or the top three face buttons to hit notes, but because pressing them together to hit multiple notes is a bit fiddly you’ll end up sort of using both sides in tandem. It took my brain a while to really gel with this way of playing, and although I can’t think of a more elegant solution outside of grabbing a Guitar Hero controller, it did still detract from the early hours of the game. Rift of the NecroDancer is a game that will absorb rhythm game fans for a long time, with clever gameplay and, more importantly, a sensational soundtrack. It’ll take some effort to get to grips with all the enemies the game throws your way, but once you do you’ll be in rhythm heaven and will never want to leave.

The publisher says of the game: “Enter a comedic 2D roguelike action game that puts you in the shoes of a clumsy wizard apprentice. Join a wacky wizard cult and use unique spells to defeat enemies, explore procedurally generated dungeons, and save the world from chaos”. Check out the announcement trailer, below: But beware: the fate of the world rests on your shoulders, and even the smallest decision can have a huge impact. With charming hand-drawn art, quirky characters, and unpredictable gameplay, Folly of the Wizards is the perfect adventure for anyone who loves humour, magic, and mayhem. Numskull Games has published a few titles now, such as Clive N Wrench, or the beat-em-up Final Vendetta . In our review of Final Vendetta , we said: “Final Vendetta takes what was great about classic beat-em-ups and adds a stylish new look. Combat is mostly addictive, and the variety of enemies and bosses make the playthrough well worth sticking with. It can be challenging at times, and with defending yourself tough to do, it can hurt the overall experience. Regardless, I enjoyed my time with it. Playing with a friend (or a twelve year-old daughter in my case) makes it much better, so if you’re up for some co-op action, it’ll make you appreciate the nuanced combat all the more.” Folly of the Wizards is coming to PC, Switch, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5, and will available both digitally, and with a boxed copy.

2025-01-29T14:00:16,No Man’s Sky drops another huge update: Worlds Part II,"Hello Games is starting 2025 strong with another massive update for No Man’s Sky , with Worlds Part II, and it’s out now. There’s a new trailer below, and also you can check out the full patch notes at this link to the official blog. First, the trailer: Sean Murray has dropped a statement about the new update, which you can check out, below: No Man’s Sky is a game that we all genuinely truly love. Last year we released Worlds Part I and I remember thinking at the time that this is just the beginning. We can’t wait to show people what we’ve been working on! There’s new solar systems, new planets with more variety, new terrain types, even new Gas Giants, and of course new adventures. Our next update is called Worlds Part II. Worlds Part II allows us to push the boundaries of our engine with new technology. Across the universe we’re adding billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets, and introducing new biomes and terrains without changing what people already love about the game. It’s now so far beyond what we ever thought was possible when we started out. I’ve been working on a new terrain system for a little while now. Terrain is more detailed and far more varied with huge mountains and these massive features. I’m genuinely at my happiest working on this stuff. The team is extremely busy on Light No Fire. Each time we push our engine to new places though we have this urge to share it with the community, with No Man’s Sky. Gas giants are truly epic, ten times bigger than our biggest planet. It’s truly end-game stuff to explore them with huge storms that rage across the surface. New tech allows oceans that can be several kilometers deep. A new lighting system makes them look so different. New caustics, light shafts and the deeper that you explore the darker it gets. I’ve had these moments where you’re exploring and suddenly some huge creature comes into view and it’s just incredible. Every element of our lighting has been rewritten. Shadows show more details, light flickers through the leaves, caves are dark and immersive. Oceans now reflect the clouds and stars to create these beautiful sunsets and night skies. Water reacts physically to the world around it. Creatures wade through it. There’s little dimples in the rain, and there are large waves as ships fly overhead. Sometimes there’s these moments where a ship just flies past the still ocean and the water ripples underneath and it’s just so peaceful to watch. In the depths of the ocean and on land there’s these new creatures to discover. I think we’ve gone probably weirder than ever before. When you land on a planet all the tech combines to create an emotion, that feeling of knowing that no one has ever been on this world before. I think it’s what makes this game really special. There’s tons of new gameplay too. There’s this huge quest that ties together some strands that we’ve been building for years. We’ve got an expedition that takes you on a tour of all the new worlds that we’re building and it’s got some incredible rewards. This is our ninth year since release. I think we’re doing things that the community probably never thought would happen. I honestly can’t wait for people to play. Thank you ever so much for your support. It means so much to me and the team. If that wasn’t enough, we’ve also got a deep dive video you can check out below, too. No Man’s Sky is out now for PC and consoles.

2025-01-29T11:48:23,Ninja Gaiden 2 Black review,"A few years ago I reviewed Nioh 2 and, at the time, avoided the comparisons to the Soulslike genre in favour of pointing out Nioh 2’s more obvious inspiration, namely Ninja Gaiden 2. The highpoint of Team Ninja’s trilogy was preceded by a stone cold classic and succeeded by, well, not that. But with the announcement of a fourth game in the franchise coming this year, Koei Tecmo have sprung from the shadows with Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, a remaster of the 2008 classic. Or second remaster, I suppose, after Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, which was a weirdly diluted port that was released on PS3 in 2009. But let’s forget about that, shall we, and focus instead on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, shadow-dropped during the January Xbox Showcase. Returning to the game after playing it at launch 16 years ago (I’ve erased Sigma from my mind), I’d forgotten how ridiculous and disjointed the story is. Arguably, it’s mostly irrelevant. This is a game about Ryu Hayabusa, a government-sanctioned Ninja with the demeanour of a house-cat that’s been kicked out of its favourite chair. His job is to travel to many different places that I assure you are connected and paint every surface in gleaming claret. The visual glow-up here is astounding, frankly, and had I never seen the game before I’d have believed it wasn’t a remaster at all. Combined with a faultless framerate, deliciously brutal melee action, and slick, responsive traversal, the graphical overhaul is simply stunning. Perhaps the only thing that really belies Black’s age is the camera, which is sadly set permanently to 2008 and often flat-out refuses to listen to reason. Without a lock-on option and with many of Ryu’s enemies also being similarly-clad ninjas (at least early on), you can spend a good amount of time hitting buttons, performing dazzling attacks, and achieving roughly nothing. Purists will tell you that this isn’t a button-masher, and in later stages they’re absolutely right, but it’s a lot more generous with health refills, save points, and regeneration thanks to a certain amount of Sigma’s residue clinging to the corners – and that’s without using the newly-added Hero Mode that lowers the difficulty below the standard setting. Of course, it ramps up the difficulty pretty quickly, and you’ll soon graduate from sword and claw-wielding ninjas through attack dogs that fight with noticeable combos to full on monsters and demons. By the time you’re in an arena fighting a multi-armed werewolf, all the tricks and weapons in the world won’t make for an easy time. But Ninja Gaiden 2 Black throws a lot of stuff at you at regular intervals. There’s over half-a-dozen weapons from katanas to claws, twin scythes to a scythe on a chain (a kusari-gama, if you want to get technical). In addition to melee weapons you also have unlimited throwing stars and Ninpo, a version of magic similar to the magic later seen in Nioh and its sequel. These often screen-filling attacks do devastating damage to enemies and bosses, but will consume your energy to use. Both energy and health can be refilled at save points or by killing enemies – or by using various consumable items. As you move through each mission location vanquishing beasts and ninjas of the Black Spider Clan, you’ll develop Ryu’s skills and increase his damage output and survivability. For those who want to dive deeper into game design, combat balance, or character progression systems — especially from an academic or analytical perspective — it might be useful to consider services like Seminararbeit schreiben lassen , which help explore such mechanics in structured written form. The genius of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is how it balances Ryu’s growing suite of skills and weaponry with the steadily-increasing difficulty, simultaneously giving you more and more ways to deal with threats while always ensuring those threats remain relevant. It’s a level of design many modern games struggle with, and it’s easy to see why Ninja Gaiden 2 was such a hit on release. The combat is incredibly slick and fast-paced. Blocking is as easy as holding the button (though enemies will punish you for over-using it), but dodging and countering take timing to master. The still-impressive finishing system is a joy to behold, too: lop a limb off an enemy and you can immediately finish them by pressing Y or Triangle. Do this and Ryu will do something incredibly cool while spraying viscera all over the walls like he’s shaking a champagne bottle half-filled with blood and sausage meat. It’s both surprising and impressive how well this game holds up. The extensive graphical remastering obviously helps, but even without that the gameplay would carry it. Nonsensical story aside, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black remains an absolute classic. Elsewhere improvements to the UI and environment textures are just as welcome, though it’s worth noting that some things have also been stripped out. Extraneous game modes such as Ninja Race are gone, which is surprising and a little disappointing – though perhaps Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo reasoned that such things may feel superfluous in this day and age. If you’re coming to this as an absolute newcomer you’re in for a treat. It’s not as punishing as you may have heard it once was, and there are certain things that will feel like they’re still in 2008, but overall Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a great remastering of a genuinely superb game, and will raise a smile in fans and new players alike.

We were told we can keep him for a while, so excited to share that Shovel Knight will make his courageous return in Yooka-Replaylee. In addition to a shiny coat of paint, the wielder of the shovel blade also comes with a new and improved quest for you to undertake for one of those shiny Pagies. Playtonic officially turns 10 years old in February and to celebrate we have something very exciting to share with you very soon. He’s been waiting for his turn. Here’s a rundown of what’s new to this redux of the game, according to Steam : MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER – With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favourite buddy duo has never looked or moved better. NEW AND IMPROVED CHALLENGES – Improvements to existing in-game challenges and many entirely new challenges to discover and undertake! NEW COLLECTIBLE CURRENCY – Capital B’s inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games’ most beloved sentient vending machine. NAVIGATING THE WORLD – Now you can get lost in the game, not in the world! A brand-new world map and challenges tracker helps you know where you are and what needs to be done. Hooray! VENDI HAS PLENTY TO OFFER – Tonics are back with all new flavours!

Created by developers Jérémie & Thibaut, Kaya’s Prophecy looks colourful and is described as a “card-based village builder featuring deckbuilding combat, with the slight added challenge of having an all-knowing, omnipresent deity to appease.” Check out a trailer, below: Fans of the genre can revel in the satisfaction of careful resource management, the strategy of forging the perfect deck, and the heartwarming pride of watching their village grow. They just need to make sure their God doesn’t get mad and fry someone alive – simple! As the tribe grows and develops, players can unlock new discoveries to improve village life (with their deity’s approval, of course). Craft innovative new technologies, tools and structures to cultivate a thriving community. New materials and rewards lie in unexplored territories, which tribe members can explore and conquer, if they’re brave enough. Life under an omnipotent God isn’t all gloom and fear. Sure, villagers could be subject to deadly weather phenomena at the slightest provocation, but there are plenty of rewards to be given to the faithfully devoted. Players who keep their Gods well-fed with plenty of offerings can enjoy bountiful boons and goodies for their tribe. A considerable portion of the food supply in exchange for not dying is a pretty good deal, right? Players can challenge themselves to survive in a cut-throat jungle, armed only with a deck of cards and a couple of human sacrifices, and lead their tribe to glory.

2025-01-28T13:00:18,WWE 2K25 | 13 details you need to know,"We recently attended a Q and A with the developers of WWE 2K25 , and there were a lot of cool details revealed about the upcoming title. While they talked about many of the features already revealed, there were some titbits of information fans are going to be excited to hear about. With that in mind, here’re 13 details about WWE 2K25 you’re going to want to know. The Island is bringing wrestling to video games Andrea Listenberger, Senior Narrative Designer at Visual Concepts and a former writer on WWE Smackdown, is the main writer of the new mode. While we didn’t get a ton of details about what the story is about, she did say “it’s not like anything you’ve seen in MyRISE.” While MyRISE is still a part of WWE 2K25, the story of the island is more like bringing wrestling to video games. We’ll let you dive into what that means, but she did say it was the reverse of MyRISE that has always focused on bringing video games to wrestling. The soundtrack is getting some “deeper cuts” this year We’ve had some pretty good tracks in the WWE soundtrack over recent years, and this year looks no different. Al Stavola at 2K alluded some this year featuring some “deeper cuts” from WWE’s music catalogue. It makes you wonder if we’re getting some Jim Johnson classics, or maybe some songs synonymous with famous WWE promos such as ‘My Way’ by Limp Bizkit? Who knows, but the possibilities are exciting. It’s also worth mentioning that custom soundtracks still aren’t a part of the game, but that’s a decision that doesn’t lie with 2K, and that decision is far above their pay grade. The Underground match type involve a lot of reworked mechanics WWE 2K25 features some new match types that change the way in-ring action plays out. For example, the Underground match sees a ring without ring posts and ropes. Derek Donahue, Lead Combat Designer at Visual Concepts said “the idea of a ring without ropes has completely upended how combat works in the game, and that’s something you’re going to feel immediately when you get into the match. The interactions at the edge of the ring are completely reworked and this is something that helps both underground matches and fighting outside the arena in brawl arenas.” The crowds will also react differently during these matches as well, with fans banging on the mat, bringing carnage to the arena. What exactly is involved in the Bloodline Rules match type? We’ve all seen the Bloodlines Rules match in WWE 2K25, famously closing out last year’s WrestleMania, but how does it work in the confines of WWE 2K25? While it does indeed feature no DQ etc, there’s a mechanic that allows each Superstar a total of three run-ins during the match, which takes the form of a Payback ability. Once you reach the right number of gauges to use a run-in, someone can be called out to help with the Bloodlines Rules match. There’re exclusive titles for Intergender Wrestling Derek also revealed that there will be titles to unlock that both male and female Superstars can compete for, which is pretty cool as not even WWE has them initiated in their own titles. There will also be some other options with regards to Intergender Wrestling that unlock the more you play, but these details were kept under wraps. Barricade dives have their own allocated move sets For those of you looking forward to dive off of the barricades in WWE 2K25, some details were revealed about moves being initiated from the barricades. Superstars will have their own move sets when it comes to jumping of barricades. The LED boards that surround the ring these days in WWE will also begin to get damaged the more players are thrown into them, adding yet another sense of reality to in-ring action. MyGM getting cross-brand PLEs and trading MyGM has come along way since it was introduced, and during the Q and A, Alan Flores, Design Director at Visual Concepts said “we’re also adding Cross brand PLEs, too, which sort of plays into the betrayal part, because now you sort of like can put your own superstars against each other, I guess. We have a bunch of new GM’s, a bunch of new dramas involved as well. So there’s gonna be a lot of backstabbing a lot, of complaining superstars. You know, people trying to trade each other. All that type of stuff is going to be featured in it.” 2K Showcase is getting rid of Slingshot technology and bringing back full cutscenes The balance between playing 2K Showcase and watching real-life footage has received positive and negative feedback since its inception. This year, Slingshot tech has been removed in favour of allowing players to play the entire matches. Dino Zucconi, Designer at Visual Concepts, said “We wanted the emphasis on showcase this year to really be more about playing than it is watching, and I think that was kind of what we were hearing the last few years. So this time we want to really give it back to the player.” There will be three outcomes for matches in 2K Showcase Dino continued to elaborate on what we would be getting from the 2K Showcase mode in WWE 2K25 which features on the Bloodline. He said there would be a three-prong approach. You can finish each match how it finished in real-life, try to change these matches by getting the other person or team to win, and play out dream matches featuring Superstars from the extended Anoa’i family. We don’t know the full roster yet, but I am praying for Haku to come back to WWE 2K. Damn, I should’ve asked! Many match types will include Intergender options If you want to relive R-Truth entering the Royal Rumble, well now you can. There are no restrictions on what Superstars can compete in any match, but the game doesn’t force it on you. If you want to have women competing in men’s matches, or men competing in women’s matches, the option is there. The only restriction is the Mixed Tag match as that features a strict rule set. Backstage Brawls can now have 8 players involved There have been some restrictions in the past that has meant these epic brawls backstage can’t go above a certain limit of Superstars, but now there can be a total of 8 involved. This is going to mean some crazy moments unravelling as you have plenty of carnage going off on screen at any one moment. The third-person cam is going to be revolutionary Initially added to follow Superstars out as they make their entrances this year, 2K has embodied the third-person cam and taken it into every match imaginable, including backstage brawls and Hell in a Cell. Derek said “when you’re climbing the top rope, when you’re running on ringside, when you’re climbing to the top of a Hell in a Cell, being able to follow the character all the way up there, and really feel like you’re embodying them rather than the standard kind of broadcast view, or the classic grand cam broadcast view that we’ve we’ve had previously.” He continued to talk about how this works with control changes. “So it’s just a whole new way of kind of playing and immersing yourself in the game. It’s had some control challenges. For sure, the right stick controls the camera, but it also does other things in game, other things in gameplay, and I think we found a really nice compromise with the way that it works with. There’s just one new button you have to press to kind of unlock those right stick actions, but normally right stick is going to control your camera. It takes like a second to get used to, but once it clicks you’re just playing the game like you normally were, with a totally new view.” The new ‘Giant’ archetype adds a brand new way to play Where previously there have been 4 archetypes in wrestling, the new giant one brings new ways to both play as and face. They have an additional health bar, but they can’t do any high-flying spots, and combos are going to be limited due to more stamina being needed to initiate them. WWE 2K25 will release on March 14, 2025 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

2025-01-28T09:01:36,Split Fiction gets a new trailer showing off side stories and co-op gameplay,"As we get closer to the March release date for Split Fiction , it seems we’re getting a new trailer for the game, showing off the side-stories and co-op. Hazelight says that: “In the trailer, Hazelight founder, Josef Fares showcases more of the inventive co-op scenarios and ever-changing gameplay variety the studio is known for. The video also shows off Side Stories: optional one-off adventures hidden in the main story levels that shake up the mechanics even more, as main characters Mio and Zoe surf on sandfish and snowboard down a mountain in the middle of a futuristic battlefield.” Check out the trailer, below: You and your co-op partner play together as Mio & Zoe, two writers stuck in a simulation of their own stories while visiting the shady new Rader Publishing headquarters in pursuit of a lucrative publishing deal. An accident puts Mio and Zoe inside the same shared simulation, throwing them back and forth between their own sci-fi and fantasy fiction while the nefarious publishing company tries to steal all of their ideas. On the official blog , we get some info about the side-stories: If you’ve played A Way Out or It Takes Two before, you’ll know that Hazelight Studios are masters of co-op gameplay variety. In addition to all of the incredible sci-fi and fantasy variety featured in the Split Fiction main story, you will encounter mysterious, out of place portals that you can enter to explore all new and vastly different worlds and locations that are completely optional. These are Side Stories! Side Stories are anomalies that occur as a consequence of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. These portals are attempts by the simulation to steal unfinished stories and ideas that Mio and Zoe wrote when they were younger, leading to some truly weird, wonderful, and chaotic situations. Read our interview from 2021 with Josef Fares, here . Split Fiction is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA App on March 6th.

2025-01-28T09:00:51,Mark of the Deep review,"At a glance, Mark of the Deep looks a lot like another Hades clone, of which there are a worryingly increasing number these days. Realm of Ink, Sworn, Redacted – all titles that borrow a great deal from Supergiant’s roguelike masterpiece. But beyond initial impressions, Mad Mimic’s adventure has little in common with Hades. It’s an isometric Metroidvania, in fact, with a dash of Soulslike and a fairly even dusting of Curse of the Dead Gods on its combat. As Rookie, you find yourself washed up on a mysterious island with the rest of your crew scattered or dead. Armed with a huge hook and an inexhaustible dodge roll, you make your way to a ramshackle camp assembled by a few survivors, before being sent out to find the crew and, hopefully, a way off the island. It doesn’t make an awful lot of sense why the first guy you find can’t come with you, armed as he is with a massive hammer and the kind of beard bears could hibernate in, but that’s what Rookie gets for being protagonist, I guess. While the story exists mostly as a framework for exploration and combat, there is a certain amount of intrigue around the island itself, particularly its inhuman inhabitants and the ruins they’re investigating. You’ll find shreds of exposition in conversations or written on huge glowing tablets dotted around. Suffice to say there are undead hordes, giant crabs, and fish monsters everywhere, and you need to smash their lovecraftian arses back into the brine. Initially armed only with the hook, you’ll soon unlock new ways to deal damage – beginning with the flintlock pistol that lets you charge up shots with melee attacks before dishing out high single-target damage. It’s also useful for hitting distant switches, which you’ll do a lot of. For much of the game, Mark of the Deep will have you explore an area, unlocking shortcuts and ladders as you go, to find special switches that will open the gate to the boss area. Each boss you kill and new area you find will reward you either with a new weapon, new Relic, or a new way to remove obstacles and open up even more areas. Bosses are tough, but it’s a simple enough case of pattern recognition. You will need to be aware of certain things, though, whether fighting a boss or a normal mob: one, they almost all have some form of wind-up or lunge – or both – baked into their attacks; and two, they will track you, so trying to dodge past them or hitting the button a fraction early will reward you with a smack in the cakehole. Death returns you to the last glowing obelisk you rested at, but while enemies respawn on rest, shortcuts you’ve found remain open and treasures you’ve uncovered remain yours. As you explore and find the rest of your crew, some will return to the camp to offer their services, allowing you to slowly build up a hub area where you can buy items and upgrade your gear. It’s a fairly linear set up, but that just keeps things simple. Anyone who has played, well, any isometric roguelike recently will be familiar with the art style here. Mark of the Deep could pass for Hades, Ravenswatch , Curse of the Dead Gods, or any of a number of other titles. It’s an attractive aesthetic for sure, but it’s beginning to veer towards overused, and while it feels unfair to pick on Mark of the Deep for it, it could cause people to overlook it based on what they perceive it be. But Mark of the Deep isn’t a roguelike any more than Dark Souls is. Progression is persistent, and there is a narrative to follow. Death simply drops you back at a checkpoint to continue the story. One thing I did find odd was that, while enemies don’t spawn unless you rest, breakables in the environment will repair themselves when you leave the screen, meaning you’ll need to break them every time you leave an area and come back. Which is annoying to say the least. I’ll also admit to not knowing where it wanted me to go half the time. There are often multiple routes to explore, most of which will loop round on one another thanks to numerous shortcuts, and while it’s great to have such intricate level design, it only works if an area has landmarks or memorable points of interest to navigate by. Mark of the Deep’s level design isn’t quite intuitive enough to get away with it. When you can run around an area four times before you find the correct route at the top of a ladder you were certain you’d climbed already because it looks the same as the other ten you definitely did climb already, it’s not a good look. Arguably, these are nit-picks at best. I always did eventually find my way through, and I came to terms with the combat eventually. Once I got past my usual Soulslike habit of dodging through an attack to get them from behind and realised spacing and timing were crucial, I got on better. The flintlock also makes things easier early on by doing so much damage in a single shot. Relics help too, as they will grant buffs when you equip them such as extending the reach of Rookie’s hook or allowing you to dodge roll faster and more frequently. What kept me coming back to Mark of the Deep was the exploration though, despite my few issues with it. Unlocking a shortcut is always a great feeling, and once the combat clicked even the boss fights were a lot of fun. It’s never punishingly hard, but it does maintain a steady level of challenge and isn’t afraid to rap your knuckles for trying to rush through it. It may not look overly original on the surface, but dive a little further and Mark of the Deep is an engaging, compelling little adventure.

2025-01-28T00:01:49,How Gaming Mechanics Are Influencing Online Gambling,"The online gambling industry has seen a rapid transformation over the past decade, with gaming mechanics playing a pivotal role in shaping the way players engage with online casinos. As game developers borrow elements from the video game industry, casinos have evolved to offer more immersive and rewarding experiences for players. These changes have not only increased player retention but have also introduced a new demographic of gamers into the world of online gambling. For those looking to explore these innovations, checking out this list of casinos with no deposit bonus at Kryptocasinos can be a great way to start without financial commitment. The Gamification of Online Casinos Gamification has become a buzzword in online gambling, with many casinos incorporating video game-like features to keep players engaged. Elements such as leaderboards, achievements, and missions have transformed traditional casino experiences into interactive and competitive adventures. By offering rewards for completing specific tasks or progressing through different levels, online casinos tap into the psychological motivations that drive gamers to keep playing. This approach not only enhances user experience but also encourages long-term loyalty. Reward Systems and Progression Mechanics One of the most notable gaming mechanics influencing online casinos is the implementation of reward systems and progression mechanics. Players are no longer satisfied with simple wins and losses; they want to feel a sense of accomplishment. Online gambling platforms now offer loyalty programs, tiered VIP systems, and milestone-based bonuses that mirror the reward structures found in popular video games. These systems motivate players to return and continue their gambling journey, as they can see tangible progress and unlock exclusive benefits. Social Interaction and Multiplayer Features Online gambling is no longer a solitary activity. Inspired by the social elements of multiplayer video games , online casinos now incorporate chat functions, community events, and even collaborative missions. Live dealer games, for instance, allow players to interact with dealers and fellow participants in real time, creating a more immersive and social experience. Additionally, some platforms enable players to challenge their friends in poker or compete in slot tournaments, fostering a sense of camaraderie and competition. Storytelling in Casino Games Storytelling is another gaming mechanic that has found its way into the online gambling sphere. Many modern slot games are designed with engaging narratives, character development, and plot-driven gameplay. This approach keeps players invested, as they are not just spinning reels but progressing through an engaging story that unfolds with each win or bonus round. Storytelling elements make gambling more entertaining and encourage players to explore different game titles to uncover new narratives. Skill-Based Gambling Games Traditionally, casino games have been primarily based on luck, but the rise of skill-based gambling games is changing the landscape. Borrowing from competitive gaming genres, skill-based games allow players to use their abilities and strategic thinking to influence the outcome. Games like poker, blackjack, and even certain slot variations now include skill-based elements that reward players for their knowledge and decision-making, appealing to a broader audience of gamers looking for more control over their gambling experience. Personalization and Customization The gaming industry has long embraced personalization, allowing players to customize their characters, game settings, and experiences. Online casinos are following suit by offering tailored experiences based on individual preferences and behavior. From personalized bonus offers to customizable avatars and interfaces, players can now enjoy a more unique and engaging gambling journey that aligns with their interests and playstyle. The Future of Gaming Mechanics in Online Gambling As technology continues to advance, the integration of gaming mechanics in online gambling is expected to become even more sophisticated. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies are on the horizon, promising to take the immersive experience to the next level. Additionally, blockchain technology is opening up new possibilities for transparency and fairness, ensuring that players can trust the games they are engaging with. With these developments, the line between gaming and gambling will continue to blur, offering an exciting future for both industries. Conclusion The incorporation of gaming mechanics into online gambling has revolutionized the industry, making it more engaging, interactive, and rewarding for players. From gamification and social interaction to storytelling and skill-based elements, these innovations are attracting a new wave of users who crave more than just a spin of the reels. Whether you are a seasoned gambler or a newcomer, exploring the evolving world of online casinos can provide an exciting blend of entertainment and potential winnings.

2025-01-28T00:01:40,Lottery-Style Games: Strategies and Best Practices,"Thanks to Internet penetration, games of chance have become more accessible than ever before. Players can now enjoy themselves remotely via platforms like the Xon.Bet Casino in a few clicks rather than going all the way to physical gambling lobbies or raffle ticketing kiosks. When it comes to raffles, it should be mentioned that lottery-style games are one of the most popular gambling verticals today. This is especially the case since they boast of awarding the largest payouts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the luckiest players. For instance, the Powerball jackpot started the 2025 draw at $200 million with a cash option of over $90.7 million. The last winner claimed a $256 million prize in New York on December 7. But bagging the big check in any lottery-style game is almost unachievable. It’s a long shot, but a few small steps can tip the seemingly impossible odds (marginally) in your favor. Could this day present your lucky break on the way to your fortune? Here’s a closer look at how you can even the odds of bagging the megabucks. How Unlikely Is It to Win a Lottery? Winning a lottery like Mega Millions or Powerball is incredibly rare. You’re looking at odds of one in 300 million. The chances are equivalent to flipping heads 28 consecutive times or picking a random second from the past nine years. Can Extra Tickets Really up Your Odds? Absolutely! If you grab five tickets with unique numbers, you’ll have five times the chance of winning. But the odds are still incredibly slim. To put this into perspective, the chances of your getting struck by lightning in your lifetime are 300 times more than winning Mega Millions. You’ll need 300 tickets to achieve odds similar to getting hit by lightning! So, how can you gain an edge when chasing life-changing opportunities? The next section will guide you aptly. Strategies for Winning Lottery-Style Games The odds of bagging a lottery prize are low, but these strategies will bring you closer to wins. Play the Right Game We’ll begin with the most crucial step – getting the right game. There are many options available in 2025, including state and national lotteries. Each has different competitions. What matters is the odds of winning, how many numbers are drawn, and the pool of possible numbers. State lotteries usually offer better odds, but their rewards are smaller. However, when you play lottery-like titles in the lobby of online casinos, you can expect better prizes. With that in mind, scratch-off games and keno at online casinos can offer better chances of winning. Looking at the Xon.Bet casino lobby, for instance, some of the most exciting options with huge winning potentials include the following: Super Keno by KA Gaming; The Candy Keno by Mascot Gaming; Magic Keno by Turbo Games; Keno Express by Galaxsys; Book of Keno by Evoplay; Russian Keno by Smartsoft. Consider Less Popular Lottery Games Lotteries like Powerball and Mega Millions attract players with huge jackpots and well-known brands. These games have a long history of massive payouts that grab attention. However, it’s worth looking beyond the big names. Smaller lotteries often offer better odds and a higher chance of being the only winner. Go for ‘Rare’ Numbers It’s easy to think of your birthday as a lucky number as you select your lottery numerals. But this limits your luck. This decision leads to most numbers falling between 1 and 31. In 2016, a lady won a Mega Millions jackpot using family birthdays and the number 7. She shared the $636 million prize with another winner. Each number has the same chance of being drawn, but less common numbers reduce the odds of sharing a jackpot. Consider choosing numbers above 31, as they’re less popular. You’ll likely keep the full prize if you end up winning. Leverage the Second Chance Lottery Second-chance lotteries give you another opportunity to win without purchasing additional tickets. Only a few games of this type offer this option, which can be pretty rewarding. The process is simple. You enter the main draw after buying your ticket. If you don’t win, fill out the form on the back and submit it for a second chance. This feature runs automatically in online lotteries. One random ticket is chosen for the second draw. The jackpot may not come your way, but you’ll attempt a six-figure reward for free. In December 2019, Malek Dabwan won $1,000,000 in North Carolina’s Education Lottery using the second-chance option. Should We Avoid the Numbers in the Last Drawing? Lottery balls are drawn randomly, so there’s only a tiny chance (about 3 to 4%) that a number will repeat from the last draw. However, every number has the same success potential, and each ball is just as likely to appear again. Ready to Take the Chance With Lotteries? Like any other games of chance, it is practically impossible to predict the outcome of the lottery-style competitions. Nonetheless, if you keep our pointers in mind the next time you buy your tickets, you will boost your chances of Lady Luck coming to knock on your door. Good luck, and play responsibly!

2025-01-28T00:01:38,The Most Popular Video Games That Casino Enjoyers Will Also Love,"Video gaming and casino gaming have many overlaps. These overlaps mean that people who typically enjoy playing at casinos or online casino platforms can probably find a video game that ticks some of the same boxes that their favourite casino games do. Things like luck, strategy and high-stakes plays are just some of the overlaps that casino gaming and video gaming have in common. While video gaming and casino gaming have many differences, they have more things in common than most people might think. When it comes to the most popular video games of the last decade or two, there are a number that feature elements or themes similar to those of casino gaming which might appeal to casino gaming enthusiasts. From mechanics that are largely driven by luck to strategic play and high-stakes plays, the broad strokes of video gaming hold a number of mirrors to the casino gaming experience. This article will cover how casino gaming stacks up against video gaming in terms of current popularity and how online casino platforms are bringing video and casino gaming closer than ever. It will then close with a list of popular video games that casino gaming enthusiasts might enjoy. Are video games or casino games more popular or influential? Both video games and casino games are very popular leisure and entertainment activities. With audiences that span across the entire globe, they both have followings of dedicated gamers and more casual interactors. It is estimated that the number of people who play video games is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3.32 billion active and regular gamers. For casino gaming, the number of people who play at an online casino venue once a year is estimated to be around 4.2 billion. While this might make it seem that casino gaming is far and away more popular, the caveat is that the casino gamers might only play once in a year and the core of more dedicated gamers could well belong to those who play video games. It should also be stated that these numbers are not mutually exclusive and not only is it likely that there is some overlap, but as the lines between video gaming and casino gaming continue to blur, that overlap will become more and more pronounced. How online casino platforms close the gap While this article is primarily about video games that have elements of casino gaming in them, it feels right to include a section about how online casino platforms are closing the gap between the two mediums from the other direction. These digital platforms typically offer a large range of games and different types of experiences. From slot and luck-based games to more strategic and classic card games, those interested in exploring online casino platforms should visit bestonlinecasino.com for more information on some of the better offerings out there. But apart from the games and the increased accessibility that the online platforms provide, they also offer more elements that help them overlap with the world of video gaming. Most of the better online casino platforms include meta-gamification elements around the games they offer. Things like login streaks, challenges and trophies all make engaging with their games more appealing for those with a predilection to enjoy gaming. Grand Theft Auto V Without any more preamble, the first game on our list is Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), specifically the Diamond Casino & Resort update. This particular update added a virtual casino complex that players can explore and play in. With literal casino games like poker, slot machines, blackjack and roulette available to play, this needs no explanation for its inclusion. There are other elements of casino gaming and betting at work in GTA V, with players able to bet on who will win minigames when playing against each other online, but the features most likely to appeal to casino gaming enthusiasts are in the virtual in-game casino. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt This one is interesting, and we could have listed this instead as Gwent: The Witcher Card Game because the element of The Witcher 3 that is most likely to appeal to casino gaming enthusiasts is its Gwent minigame. Gwent is a collectable card game and fully realised minigame within The Witcher 3 and was later released as a standalone card game and more recently, as a physical card game . For casino gaming enthusiasts who enjoy strategy, planning and bluffing, Gwent will appeal. We chose the full game of The Witcher 3, because, frankly, it’s art and should be experienced. The Yakuza series This series, published by SEGA, typically has a number of different gambling games in each iteration. Slot machines, mahjong, poker and blackjack all make regular appearances. These games are placed as small side-ventures in the bustling and immersive world of the Yakuza games , with players able to visit them by entering underground casinos. These small side games make for an excellent break from the otherwise right story and more hands-on action typical of the Yakuza series. Slay the Spire For casino game enjoyers who like strategic risk, Slay the Spire could tickle exactly the right spots for you. Slay the Spire is a roguelike deck-builder that lets you have some control over your fate, but often just enough to let you trip yourself up. With high risks that lead to high rewards, this game can let you feel as though your smart decisions have directly led to massive success. Hearthstone Yet another card game makes the list! We think that casino gaming enthusiasts who enjoy strategy and luck, the same things that casino card games have in spades, will enjoy Hearthstone. This game is developed by Blizzard and like Gwent it is a deck-building game that will reward deep knowledge of the possible cards in play and can involve a decent amount of bluffing when it comes to high-level play. Conclusion To conclude, for fans of casino gaming who particularly enjoy the strategic gameplay, luck and risk that casino games often offer, there are many good choices in the video gaming world. From roguelikes that reward risk-taking, to card games that work like magic for those of a strategic mindset to more traditionally luck-based games as a side-diversion, there are plenty of different video games that can scratch that casino gaming itch.

2025-01-27T16:00:05,Eternal Strands review,"These days it’s hard to predict exactly what kind of cache you’ll get for announcing that a game is from ex-Dragon Age: Origins developers. Origins was released a long time ago, and every Dragon Age game since – including last year’s Veilguard – has only been met with highly qualified praise. But something about Eternal Strands caught my eye early on. Perhaps its the fact that it looks very similar to Kingdoms of Amalur at a glance – a game that will always have a bed in my spare room. Or it might be that it has elements borrowed from Breath of the Wild and Immortals: Fenyx Rising, or that there’s an air of AA ambition about it that I always find really easy to get behind. Whatever the reason, Eternal Strands got my attention when it was first announced, and I’m glad it did. In it, you play Brynn, the primary warrior among a mercenary group made up of archaeologists, adventurers and magic-users, who find themselves in a decaying deadly world in the aftermath of a magic-slash-scientific apocalypse. Each one is a “Weaver”, a persecuted magic user who just wants to survive a hostile world that wants them dead. It’s your job to go out into that world and find “Loomgates”, fast travel points that connect every major area of the world, as well as Arks. These are huge constructs that contain rare resources that your little troop needs. It’s fighting these Arks that gives the story much of its drive. You climb them with a BotW-style stamina mechanic, smashing off sections of their armour to deal damage as they grab at you and try to shake you off. You’ll need stronger and stronger gear to prevail against them, which necessitates exploration and gathering. Resources come from a variety of places, such as boxes and bags, enemy drops, and treasure chests. You’ll need to bring back what you can, which can either be used to craft or upgrade Brynn’s armour and weapons, or be converted to camp supplies. These supplies are used to upgrade your team’s various services, such as Sofia’s forge or Casmyn’s caravan. These upgrades in turn allow you to get stronger, or extract more items if you die. Upon death you’ll be teleported back to the camp, but you can only save a limited number of resources each time you do. Combat has a couple of facets. First, Brynn can choose between her sword and shield, a two-handed weapon, and a bow. Counter-intuitively, these aren’t simply mapped to buttons, but must be selected via a radial menu each time you want to switch. It feels almost old-fashioned, and there’s no real reason this couldn’t have been smoother and simpler. It means you’ll need to either chase an enemy or go into a menu to get your bow out when they run away, and a lot of enemies will flee when you deal damage. The enemies themselves don’t feel too creative, either, and fighting does begin to feel like a slog on longer expeditions. You can lock on and parry, but sometimes it feels floaty and unresponsive. Enemy HP is also inconsistent, while certain enemies like the Darters who turn invisible and spit poison at you are more frustrating than anything. Luckily, Brynn is a Weaver, and possesses some magic abilities, too. You’ll unlock more and more powers as you go, beginning with Kinetic and Frost skills. You can freeze enemies in blocks of ice, or pick them up and throw them at one another. You’ll also use Brynn’s powers to overcome obstacles, such as clearing debris or putting out fires. Spells are weaved into the fabric of her Mantle, which changes colour and pattern depending on which spell you have equipped. Gear crafting is interesting, too, as you will often have a choice of which materials to use and they will bestow different stats and appearances on it. Sofia may just ask for a “carved resource” for example, which can be any kind of wood or bark. It means you could craft multiple versions of an armour set for different occasions – though you likely won’t need to go as far as build-crafting here. Eternal Strand’s story is pretty well told, but much of it hinges on the characters – most of whom I really liked. Where it struggles is in the presentation of the story and characters, as it seems inconsistent at best. Sometimes you’ll get a fully animated cutscene, sometimes a stylised cartoon that only feels a few steps up from just giving us static images. I really didn’t like the style used in these sequences, as it just felt weirdly unfinished and the characters appeared with way less detail than the rest of the game. During dialogue, you’ll often just see static images of the characters. Each is fully voiced though, which helps their personalities come through. So what you have here is a smaller, more focused version of Immortals: Fenyx Rising. The world isn’t open but it is connected, and there’s less variety in enemies and items, but that just feels more streamlined. Fighting the Arks as you hang off them is always pretty exhilarating, even if there’s a certain amount of jank going on at any given time. Like Atlas Fallen from 2023, Eternal Strands feels like a double-A doing its best to fit in at a triple-A party, and that’s not a criticism. It may suffer from some wobbly mechanics here and there, but the ambition is clear and a lot of it works. Fighting a dragon amidst a crumbling village in the middle of a swamp was an early highlight, as the dragon obliterated everything I tried to hide behind and I was forced to ride the damn thing more than once, or try to pin it to the ground with reams of ice. If you don’t mind a few frayed ends and you’re in the mood for a charming adventure through a gorgeous fantasy world, Eternal Strands is worth checking out.

2025-01-27T15:15:45,Two Point Museum gets a new overview trailer,"Two Point Studios and SEGA have together released an overview trailer for Two Point Museum, coming on March 4th. The team says: “Two Point Museum takes players into a realm where art meets antics, and exhibits collide with occasionally questionable management choices”, and adds that this new trailer gives an overview of the game. Check out the new trailer, below: Running a museum is a balancing act of epic proportions. Money comes from ticket sales, donations, and the perfectly reasonable prices at the gift shop. But beware – arranging expeditions, marketing, workshops, decorations, training, and all those other pesky expenses could put you in the red. Fortunately, loans and sponsorships are always available as backup, though they come with their own risks. A major component of any curator’s management duties is overseeing their staff. They are the backbone of any museum… and occasionally its biggest headache. Experts analyse and maintain exhibits, janitors handle messes and workshop builds, assistants manage ticket booths, gift shops and expeditions while security protects exhibits, donations and the peace. Skilled staff come at a price, so museum managers must keep those pay checks flowing or risk facing their wrath. So, who’s up for the challenge? In our hands-on preview, we said : “On top of everything else, it looks absolutely lovely, with the series’ trademark bright, cartoony visuals bringing it all to life. It’s also very accessible, with simple controls and easy item placement, and objectives that are straightforward while still making you work a little to tick them off. There’s something about Two Point Museum that feels more laidback than previous instalments, yet I was never bored or at a loss for something to do, something to tweak, or somewhere to send my teams of intrepid explorers. It’s too early to say with certainty, but I’m pretty confident that Two Point Museum is about to add another success to Two Point Studios’ record.” Two Point Museum is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on March 4th.

2025-01-27T15:00:33,Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos review,"As of 2025 the Neptunia series has been around for fifteen years. Fifteen years of parodying video game consoles with anime girls is a long time, and Neptune and the gang have some serious longevity whether you enjoy their brand of silliness or not. As a series of predominantly RPGs the quality of the Neptunia games has admittedly been a little hit and miss, yet despite this I keep coming back to them. So let’s celebrate fifteen years with another entry in this baffling series, the bizarre motorbike arcade experience that is Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos. Our protagonist of choice this time around is Uzume Tennouboshi. This recurring character apparently represents the Sega Dreamcast (although I couldn’t tell you why aside from the spiral on her tie) and has never headlined a game in the series before. Our story begins with Uzame waking up in another dimension, brainwashed into loving Dogoos. These dog-faced slimes are the Goombas of the Neptunia world, so it’s somewhat alarming that she has to fight to remember they’re the enemy. It turns out the other Neptunia girls are experiencing the same issue, and it’s up to Uzume to get on her bike and help them out of their trance to try and figure out what the hell is going on. It’s a silly little story that honestly is more enjoyable than a lot of the more long-form Neptunia narratives. To help your friends come out of their Dogoo trances, you’ll need to remove as many of the slimy foes as possible. This means racing around arenas on your motorbike and collecting them faster than the enemy riders can, with the winner reaching a specific number first. This is what every stage of Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos essentially boils down to, so you’d better get to grips with your wheels. Controlling your bike is relatively simple, although I can’t pretend it feels amazing. Alongside moving and steering you can also jump to get over gaps, boost to go faster and drift to turn corners sharper. Drifting is especially important to master, because when you drift the area surrounding your motorbike that absorbs Dogoos gets much larger. This means the most effective way to collect a big group of the little pests is to drift into them at max speed, which is rather satisfying when done perfectly. There’s another way to gather Dogoos though, and that’s to fight dirty. By riding up to your slime gathering opponent and hitting them with an attack you’ll cause them to drop a chunk of their collected Dogoos and give them to you, and especially if they’re ahead of you this is ridiculously effective. The AI opponents will also aim to attack you too though, and with both melee and ranged attacks to worry about you’ll need to stay on your toes. Each of the game’s fifteen stages boil down to this Dogoo collecting gameplay, but they’re varied enough to keep it interesting. Split across five distinct worlds, each of them features unique Dogoo types that change the game. Angel Dogoos allow you to fly across gaps, Token Dogoos can be put into slot machines for prizes, and there’s even a world that has Dogoos that make you bigger and smaller to navigate the arena effectively. These creative elements help keep you engaged throughout Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos, and ensure the endless drifting doesn’t get monotonous. As you progress through the game you’ll recruit all your favourite Neptunia girls to your party, and can choose any of them to play as. Each of the girls has different attack stats and specialities, although I must admit I was happy to just stick with Uzume for the duration and didn’t feel the need to change it up (especially because her melee ability was the best and that was my preferred method of attack). As well as selecting different girls, you’ll also earn money you can spend on new bikes and parts to equip them with. Customising your ride to maximise its Dogoo absorption area or top speed is easy, but in reality it just isn’t necessary. I completed the entire game without a whole lot of hassle by changing to a new bike once, and I never even bothered switching in new parts. The challenge isn’t really enough to make you feel the need to upgrade and shake things up, even if you go back into the stages you beat to take on the optional challenges. There’s one particularly big issue with Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos I haven’t mentioned yet, and that’s the length of the game. I completed the story in well under two hours, and although I could probably have added an hour or so to that by replaying every single level and taking on the optional objectives it’s still not a lot of game. Considering this is retailing at around forty pounds it’s a tough sell, even for the most diehard Neptunia fan. Although I had some fun with Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos, it’s not a game that’s easy to recommend you purchase at launch. With iffy controls, a short runtime, and no real need to dive deeper into customisation options, the entertaining arcade action isn’t quite good enough to overcome the issues the game has.

2025-01-27T15:00:01,Everspace 2: Wrath of the Ancients expansion announced,"Rockfish Games has announced what it’s calling a “massive new expansion” for Everspace 2, called Wrath of the Ancients. The team says Wrath of the Ancients is coming to PC ( Steam , GOG), Xbox, and PlayStation and will be launching later “this Spring”. Check out the reveal trailer, below: Players will be able to pilot a new ship to battle against alien enemies and ancient threats in an all-new story set after the events of EVERSPACE 2. Mysterious attacks have laid waste to human settlements in Cluster 34, destabilizing factions in power and stranding survivors. With this destruction, the uneasy peace between humankind and Okkar is threatened—space pilots will venture into the Okkar Homeworlds to discover the truth behind the threat before war reignites the DMZ. During the events of Wrath of the Ancients, warp gates open to four new fully explorable star systems including the Okkar homeworlds and Aethon, adding even more secrets throughout Cluster 34. These new star systems will be packed with new enemies, weapons, and gear to discover. “Our community keeps asking when they can finally explore Aethon and the answer is soon! Everspace 2: Wrath of the Ancients massively expands the universe of the Everspace series, giving pilots more star systems to explore, more enemies to battle, and a new ship that changes the game. Players who want to discover more of Cluster 34 have a lot to look forward to,” said Rockfish Games CEO and co-founder Michael Schade, adding: “Over the coming months, we’ll be sharing all kinds of reveals for Wrath of the Ancients on our social channels and streams. Stay tuned space pilots!” In our console review of the game we said: “There are countless missions to undertake, from fetching items for various characters, investigating mysterious signals, battling raiders, and more.

2025-01-27T14:22:16,Rise of the Ronin is coming to Steam in March,"Koei Tecmo has announced the Team Ninja developed action RPG Rise of the Ronin is coming to PC via Steam on March 11th. Originally a PS5 exclusive, Koei Tecmo has popped the release date just ahead of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which is coming on March 20th. As you’d expect, we’ve got a new trailer to show the PC version off, and the details and PC features as well. Here’s the list of PC features: 8K resolution support DirectX 12 Ultimate support Ultra-wide and super ultra-wide monitor compatibility 120fps support Ray tracing support 3D audio support Customisable keyboard and mouse controls AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution support NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex support UI menu with mouse click ability Intel XeSS graphics technology support The publisher also adds: “Players can now pre-order the game on Steam. Everyone who purchases the game before 2nd April will receive an early purchase bonus which includes four combat styles; Hayabusa-ryu for katana, Hayabusa-ryu for naginata, Nioh-ryu for katana and Aisu Kage-ryu for katana, the Iga Ninja armour set, and the Iga Ninja’s katana.” In our review of the game, we said : “If anything, perhaps Rise of the Ronin is a victim of Team Ninja’s recent success. It falls a little short of the high bar set by Nioh 2, and can’t fully compete with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty in terms of the combat – but perhaps that’s unfair. It balances much of these apparent shortcomings by being more accessible to newcomers and those who seek out this type of world but don’t want to lash themselves to the altar of the Soulslike for forty hours and counting. Step into this world with realistic expectations and there’s a lot of fun to be had, with a decent story, likeable characters, and fluid, satisfying combat. But don’t expect the sophistication of Nioh 2 or the laser focus of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Rise of the Ronin is a solid open world action adventure that rarely puts a foot wrong, but is unlikely to set the world on fire either.” Rise of the Ronin is out now for PS5 and comes to PC via Steam on March 11th.

2025-01-27T14:00:39,Sniper Elite: Resistance review,"While Sniper Elite: Resistance doesn’t do much different in terms of gameplay from previous entries , the setting of France gives it a life of its own. There are some incredible environments that offer a fresh feel to how you play, with plenty of verticality and opportunities for long range assault and close-up combat. Whether in the heart of a German war factory during a storm or a small French town doused in the summer sun, the freedom to complete your objectives has never been more satisfying. Instead of Karl Fairburne, you play as British agent Harry Hawker who is working alongside the French Resistance to uncover and stop a last ditch effort by the Nazis to disrupt the Ally efforts as they approach D-Day. As you follow the creation process of a chemical weapon known as ‘Kleine Blume’, you uncover a much worse threat, and as you go from mission to mission, there’s much more at stake than ever seemed possible. It’s an interesting story that takes a backseat as soon as you get stuck into the job at hand. One thing I love about the Sniper Elite series is the freedom you have when it comes to completing your mission. There’s the choice to complete main objectives, side missions, or important assassinations of integral German officers and scientists via the Kill List in anyway order you want. Then there’s the way in which you complete them; you can go in noisy and hope the alarm doesn’t get triggered, or you can take your time and pick each enemy off in silence. Sniper Elite: Resistance has some excellent enemy AI. Soldiers are always alert, and if you do pique their interest and they spot you, they might try to find a safer way to approach you, flanking you or patiently waiting for the right approach. They hunt in packs and fire at you the moment they see you, which is something other titles often fail to do. This pushes your patience levels to be at their best because there’s never an easy way to wipe out areas where there’re multiple soldiers lying in wait. You have plenty of firepower at your disposal, whether from your own weapons that can all be upgraded on workbenches if you find them, and between missions as well. You also have the option to use German firearms after an enemy has been killed, with plenty of new weapons to try out. There’s plenty of depth for those wanting full control over every element of their arsenal, however, I rarely drifted away from my original setup. Thankfully, I could upgrade everything from the bullet types, barrel, and scope, providing I unlocked the option to do so through completing missions and hitting objectives. There’s plenty of replayability thanks to unlocking to drop points on the map, going back in to complete any missions you might not have finished, and improve on your previous performances during missions. Sniper Elite: Resistance is your playground, and there’s so much depth to each mission, giving you plenty of reasons to repeat each one. No Sniper Elite game would be complete without the intricate detail in those slow motion kill replays. I never got bored of watching my well-placed shot strike an enemy. Watching as the bullet glides through the air and pierces the back of a soldier’s head, with bits of skull and brain flying everywhere, complete with myriad teeth spreading onto the floor as the shell makes the exit wound. These slow motion replays are also prevalent with stealth kills as you stab someone through the heart, or after a grenade explodes and takes out a group of soldiers. There are only eight missions, but each one can last as long as you want. Depending on your playstyle, you can take your time and be a whisper in the wind or a bull in a China shop. The different objective and the stakes of what you are doing make each new mission and location more exciting, especially as you approach the end of the campaign. They require you to be patient regardless of whether you want to or not, and I was blown away by how diverse each environment is. You can also unlock Propaganda missions that give you an opportunity to play as a French Resistance fighter, but they’re tricky to unlock. On top of multiplayer, there is also Axis Invasion to dive into. It’s such a fantastic mode that allows you to jump into another player’s campaign and try to disrupt their efforts. You can also allow other players to join your game, although this can be turned off if you wish, or even switched to friends-only. I was able to wait patiently in a German facility and bide my time as they got closer, and from above, I fired off my assault rifle and killed them where they stood. It adds an extra layer of difficulty to the campaign, and makes things much more tense. Sniper Elite: Resistance is an enjoyable title that doesn’t necessarily do anything drastically new in terms of gameplay, but rather adds a brand new side to the story and give players some of the best locations to date. Harry Hawker is a likeable agent, coming across like a mix of Jason Statham, Daniel Mays, and Virgil from Thunderbirds. The gameplay is tight, the freedom to play however you want is wonderful, and the enemy AI makes you play more cautiously than ever before.

2025-01-27T14:00:27,Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter review,"Tails of Iron was one of the best surprises of 2021, becoming one of my favourite games of the year thanks to its brutal combat and excellent storytelling. Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter has taken that formula and made the sequel just as impressive, with a story that rivals that of Game of Thrones and The Witcher, bringing back combat and making it more responsive and exciting, in a world that is both beautiful and devastating. Who knew that throwing rodents into a dark fantasy setting could be this good? After an epic introduction where your entire home is destroyed by a new threat known as the Dark Wings, Arlo must avenge the death of his father and lead his people as the new Warden of the Wastes. It’s impressive where a game without dialogue can help you warm to characters so well, but I was fully invested in Arlo’s journey, with every new discovery as thrilling as the last. It helps that Doug Cockle, famously the voice of Geralt in The Witcher games, narrates the story throughout, adding a gravitas to proceedings. The world is beautifully hand-drawn, with environments ranging from snowy mountains, dense forests, and ruined towns. Not only does each location have such detail, the characters also have some lovely touches that give them such life. You’ll encounter many different characters and races, but there’re also a ton of enemies and bosses that look stunning. Odd Bug Studio nailed it the first time around, but with Whiskers of Winter, the team has truly outdone itself. The combat is punchier, heavier, and more responsive that it ever has before. While each strike feels weighty and swift, the dodge, parry, and block is more responsive this time around. Some of the bosses are tough to defeat, but you learn their movements and attacks and are able to take advantage of the tight controls to overcome any obstacle. If you do struggle with the difficulty, there is the option to lower it (or raise it if you’re after a tougher challenge), but the middle difficulty offers the perfect balance. Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter offers plenty of opportunities to upgrade your gear and craft new stuff. By killing bigger creatures, you’ll harvest their corpses to get valuable resources. You can build different sets and equip on the fly for different scenarios, too. Some enemies can use poisonous attacks or harness fire and ice to attack, but different armour sets have a resistance to these elemental effects. You can also craft more powerful swords, spears, axes, crossbows, and more to build your perfect arsenal. You can also upgrade your settlement which gives you access to better gear at the blacksmiths, or better food from the kitchen to give you additional buffs. This not only improves Arlo as you venture closer to the Dark Wings, but also offers a sense of community with your people, and makes the stakes feel higher. As I mentioned earlier, you do start to warm to the characters, especially Arlo who I love with all my heart. While some conversations are hard to decipher due to small images appearing in speech bubbles, Lord Cockle makes these interactions easier to understand. You have some side missions available as well, such as monster contracts where you can go and kill some larger creatures and earn resources and gold for doing so. The more effort you put into upgrading, the easier it becomes, but Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is never a walk in the park. You’re challenged with every enemy you come across, as they all have stern attack patterns featuring vicious speed and purpose. Some might find this too much, but I relished the challenge and loved every second. Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is an excellent squeakquel that does everything the first game did but better. Combat is brutal as ever, but the controls are much tighter, and the whetstone is a cool new feature that allows for extra damage to be done. There’re a wealth of weapons, traps, and extra powerful abilities that aid you along the way, and the upgrades give you plenty of options for how you deal with the different types of enemies, monsters, and bosses. With a deep story and some gorgeous environments, this is a wonderful title to play.

2025-01-27T12:44:19,Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap review,"Finding a balance of difficulty for playing with friends or solo in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap was something I was hoping would work well because there’s a great challenge trying to find the balance. Of course playing in a group is fun, but there’s still so much enjoyment playing games like this alone. Going into this, I was instantly put at ease as I stepped into my first run and had an absolute blast fighting off the orcs with various traps and some wonderfully built War Mages at my disposal. Going down the rogue-like route, Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap sees you fighting off waves of enemies trying to get into a rift you need to defend. If too many of them pass through, your run is over and its back to your fortress to lick your wounds. The great news is you have so many different traps to lay down, and with so many different characters to play as, you’ll find a balance that works for you. While you do find your rhythm, it never allows you to relax, with each wave more powerful than the last. You start off with money to buy and place a range of traps, such as laser beams that fire from the ceiling, fire pits that burn orcs as they run across them, ripsaws that fire through the air, automated crossbows, launch pads, and many more. After placing the traps you want, it’s time for the wave to begin. Watching the fruits of your labour work and enemies die in hilarious ways while fighting for your life is so exhilarating. When one wave ends, the process is repeated, although you can pick a ‘thread’ that improves your game. They are essentially cards that have a specific power like improving one of your character’s traits, providing more health, or heightening the damage a specific trap might do. The different locations make you think differently when it comes to placing traps. Inside the castle, you’ll have plenty of walls and low ceilings, but out in the courtyard the open air won’t let you place those powerful laser beams, so every location offers environmental challenges for you to contend with. The further you go, the tougher the enemies become. They get bigger and more powerful, but there’s also more variety of what you have to contend with, along with those flying bastards that help heal the enemy. While you do have a wide range of traps (with more to be unlocked and upgraded between runs back in your fortress), the different War Mages offer different ways to play and approach. While I enjoyed playing as Wren due to her wand dealing relatively powerful blasts from her wand and an ability that triggers nearby traps, I fell in love with Sophie; a cat with a penchant for necromancy. Soph has dual blades that rip through orcs up close, as well as throwing from a distance. Each War Mage has an Overdrive ability that works like an Ultimate in Overwatch , and hers allows the summoning of her undead knight Bartholomew, who joins the field of play to fight alongside her. While there are War Mages in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, some of them have a focus on healing and support, and that’s where playing with others gets exciting. All War Mages have their own specialised traps and traits. Kalos is a druid bear that can heal allies while fighting, and his ‘trap’ provides healing berries when interacted with. His trait is a second health bar that means his support becomes a vital member of any team. Mac is another great support character who uses his engineering skills to slow down enemies and use his knowledge of enemies and traps to improve the damage done. Each can play a great role in teams, but they’re also strong alone, with Robot Entertainment finding a solid balance regardless as who you play as. This balance also plays into the difficulty. The amount of enemies are scaled depending on whether you are on your own or not. When you first start playing, it is rather difficult to progress far, but each character has a skill tree which you can improve every aspect of their game, and back at base you’re able to unlock a ton of new traps and upgrade how powerful they or or how much quicker they reset. You’re rewarded for the more time you put in, and I really started to find my feet once I began learning the environments and improving my characters of choice. Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap is such an exciting game to play. Fighting off the waves of enemies all featuring different buffs, debuffs, and attack patterns, as well as randomised threads make each run different from the last. It’s fun playing alone, but battling the hordes of creatures with others is where this is going to be at its best. With tons of upgrades and new traps to unlock, the gameplay is always exciting, and while it can be hard defending the rift when waves increase in difficulty, it is always thrilling to fight the various creatures you face.

2025-01-27T10:37:00,Hyper Light Breaker update adds a Medkit rework,"Developer Heart Machine has released a fairly significant update for early access title, Hyper Light Breaker , reworking the medkit system. The biggest change, really, is that you actually start with one now. Previously, the original early access build would require you to do a full cycle of the roguelike action (at least four deaths) to gain a currency to unlock a medkit, and you’d have to grab a specific item each run to increase your chance of starting the next run with one in your inventory. You’d also need to replenish at Shrines with this same item. As you can see from the changes below, the community has spoken, and Heart Machine has listened: Players now start with a Medkit. The first Medkit upgrade available via Pherus Bit now improves Medkits. Medkits now auto-refill on launch of run, up to max capacity (default 1, upgradeable to 2). Medkit refills at Shrines are now paid for with Bright Blood, not Medigems. Medigems still provide a small amount of health still when harvested, but are no longer used for Medikits or used in the end-of-cycle screen. Basically this means you will always start with a medkit now, which makes the game far more manageable. Here’s some more of the changes in the latest update: COMMUNITY SUGGESTION: Removed the tech croc brute and white dirks from the extraction spawn table. COMMUNITY SUGGESTION: Increased time between waves of additional enemies in Crown fights. Projectiles from weak enemies no longer hit-stun the player. Flinch animations will play, but the player will have full control. Previously they played a hit impact that momentarily interrupted them. Fixed an issue where damage trails would cause hit-stun on contact. Enemy aggro distance reduced. Removed some enemies from the Drop Down Lab spawns that weren’t supposed to be spawning there (or at all). The team adds : “As a studio, this has been our most ambitious project yet – making an open world roguelite (which there aren’t that many out there!) — and so, we’re beyond thrilled to make our vision for Hyper Light Breaker a reality alongside you all throughout the course of Early Access. We made Hyper Light Breaker with Early Access in mind to have it grow and evolve with our community, and today’s patch represents that as we made some pretty big changes, including a rework on Medkits, thanks to your feedback.” Hyper Light Breaker is in early access on Steam, now.

Until now it was exclusive to that demo, meaning you had to finish the demo to see it. The trailer shows off plenty of combat, some huge enemy fights, and some story moments, it seems. The demo was released on January 16th, and hit the top spot for Steam demos. Check out the trailer, below: The First Berserker: Khazan is a hardcore action RPG based on the Dungeon Fighter Online (DnF) universe, Nexon’s flagship IP with more than 800 million players worldwide.

Players will experience Khazan’s legendary journey firsthand as they master intricate and engaging combat mechanics and strategic battles that bring his epic tale to life. The First Berserker: Khazan captures the essence of Dungeon Fighter Online with its blend of flashy hack-and-slash combat and hardcore difficulty, delivering polished, high-impact action. Intense boss battles maximize tension, while hard-earned victories provide a deep sense of accomplishment, offering players a thrilling combat experience. In the 89th year of the Pell Los Empire, the Great General Khazan is falsely accused of treason and banished to the snowy mountains. Having narrowly escaped death, Khazan embarks on a quest for vengeance. Witness his growth as he uncovers the conspiracies that led to his downfall, masters lost combat skills, and unveils the truth about the empire. The Steam page says that each weapon comes with “a variety of skills that can be combined to create a combat style that’s entirely your own”.

2025-01-27T09:15:18,Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection review,"There is no escaping the fact that Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection is heavily inspired by a certain first party Nintendo franchise, in particular the Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom experiences. It doesn’t so much wear its influences on its sleeve, moreover it screams them from the rooftops with a megaphone whilst cosplaying as Link. The stamina bar, the look of the main character, even some of the runic insignia encountered in the roguelike dungeons look eerily Hyrule-esque. But this 3D remake of the previously pixelated dungeon crawler is a different and (probably obviously) inferior beast to the aforementioned classics. You take on the role of Tama, who is on an emotionally driven quest to revive her beloved friend Koko. It is the excellent story and anime styled cutscenes that are by far and away the strongest part of Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection. The opening animated movie is truly stunning, and the artwork employed during the vignettes and static storyline panels is of exceptional quality. Whilst the gameplay loop is extremely similar to the original, the transition to 3D adds a different feel and now employs a bit of platforming. There are unlockable boss rush and challenge modes too, and the ability to play local co-op. The core experience sees you move through a series of stages, fighting enemies and seeking loot, and once you obtain the titular sword you are able to resurrect and summon defeated foes to summon and fight alongside you in combat, with up to three critters being stashed at one time and dragged into the fray with a button press. In theory this is a great system and we have seen things like this employed to great effect in titles like Ni No Kuni, or the sublime Pawn system in the Dragon’s Dogma series. The problem here is that in spite of the diverse menagerie of Zelda/Dragon Quest-esque characters, in practice they often find it tough to keep up with Tama, being left behind or trapped as you work your way through the twisting dungeon maps. I also had times where they did not respond correctly to commands, for example being asked to sit on a spot to solve an environmental switch-based puzzle. There are also some irritating moments where you have to sacrifice one of your team of monsters as there are puzzles that can only be passed when you summon a particular type of enemy in your party. Combat overall is also rather dull. A 3D action platformer can live or die by the dynamism and feel of its fighting system, and most enemies can be given an easy leathering by just pressing the same button over and over. There are a decent variety of weapon types and also tools which include things like a bow and arrow to hit distant foes or switches. A rudimentary crafting system seems to be fairly underused, as I was able to progress quite easily without bothering to upgrade by standard sword and spear arsenal too often. In stark contrast to the lovely cutscenes, Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection is a drab looking experience, visually. I get the idea and commitment to providing a retro aesthetic, but the environments are far from inspiring to look at and resemble a blocky 3D platformer from a bygone era, and not in a good way. There are plenty of achievements, and some tricksy challenges to be completed on each new stage you encounter, such as finishing a stage in a set time, or clearing a section only using your sword attack, and these add a bit of longevity to proceedings but this one isn’t going to last you too long before you either defeat it or lose interest. There was much promise to Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection, and it does have a charming and heartfelt story, but if you really want to play something of this ilk then you are better served taking your business elsewhere with one of the titles I have mentioned earlier, as aside from the aforementioned visuals, it just doesn’t quite hit the mark across the board.

2025-01-27T08:59:42,Riki 8Bit Game Collection review,"RIKI 8bit Game Collection is less an actual videogame, but more a piece of audio-visual art; it uses the medium of retro-modern twitchy 8 bit media (think WarioWare , or even Game & Watch, reimagined inside a 1980s Japanese arcade) to flesh out what is essentially a canny collection of high-quality chiptune music, all wrapped up in the stunning anime/Manga aesthetic of the talented and creative RIKI, whose name and logo is proudly emblazoned all over the place. The two actual “games” included in this collection are very basic affairs, and serve more as a medium to deliver the array of exceptional aural delights. Astro Ninja Man DX is a simplistic Space Invaders clone where you control the titular ninjutsu along the bottom of the screen and use a standard projectile weapon and a more destructive laser to destroy myriad foes and debris that cascade down from above. Like everything about RIKI 8bit Game Collection, there is a surreal and hallucinatory feel to this one, with some wild art design both on screen and incorporated into the arcade cab style bezels alongside. Kira Kira Star Night (Reach for the Stars) sees you take on the role of textbook wide-eyed anime lass Kira who can leap into the air and collect the stars that swarm around the screen, all set to more of the great music, and drawn in a very Japanese, synthwave fever dream style, all neon pinks and blues, with cassette motifs and brightly lit cityscapes. The remaining three selectable segments are basically interactive chiptune albums that you can play with to your heart’s content. I cannot stress how many big hitters are involved in what RIKI has curated here. Yuzo Koshiro should need no introduction, but I will say that he was responsible for sound-tracking some of my all-time favourite titles, in particular Streets of Rage and ActRaiser . If, like me, you are partial to a classic vertical shmup, then Manabu Namiki should also make your ears prick up, thanks to their craft on all-timers like Battle Garegga. Manami Matsumae (Rockman/Mega Man), and Soichi Terada (the slept-on Ape Escape) are also part of the line up. I must stress that this is more of a fully interactive way of listening to a superb chiptune album. It is the video game medium equivalent of back in the day when Funkmaster Flex would put out his compilation CDs featuring the hottest acts in hip hop freestyling and dropping little snippets that you hadn’t heard before, and is a novel and admirable way to deliver new music. The games are kind of on the periphery here, and this will not be for everyone – there is a niche market for this aesthetic and sound – however I cannot deny that it thoroughly appeals to me and is going to be firmly in the wheelhouse of many in the still thriving retro game community. As such, beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder, but for sheer force of will and commitment to the art, and the panache with which this has been executed, Riki 8Bit Game Collection deserves a tremendous amount of credit.

2025-01-24T14:00:00,Star Wars Outlaws Descriptive Video Works interview: “it makes for a very wonderful experience”,"When it comes to AAA big budget video games, they don’t get much bigger than Star Wars Outlaws . The combination of the most popular sci-fi franchise of all time, Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft made for a wonderful video game that our own Chris White loved enough to put on his Game of the Year list. It was also praised heavily for its wonderful accessibility features, which includes audio narration. I was lucky enough to get to chat with Jenna Jennissary of Descriptive Video Works and audio narrator for Star Wars Outlaws Ramya Amuthan, and talking to them was an absolute delight. I was able to ask them about the process of adding audio narration to a video game, Star Wars Outlaws’ Innovation in Accessibility nomination, and the future of audio narration in video games. So without delay, then, let’s get into it. Star Wars is a franchise that is loved by millions and millions of people. How important was it to be able to help make Outlaws a game that as many of those as possible could play? Jenna: Of course it’s extremely important to us. Not only is Star Wars very well loved, but there are a lot of blind gamers and low vision gamers out there that are super hyped about anything being released with accessibility. They’re bloggers, they’re streamers, they’re gamers. So anytime there’s anything at all with the promise of accessibility or a preview of some accessible thing that’s going to come up in a video game, or a console development, or even a physical accessible controller, people are very very excited. So yeah it’s just like a two in one icing on the cake that it’s also Star Wars that’s being featured with all this accessibility. Star Wars has been, I guess as a franchise as a whole gradually increasing their inclusivity over the past few years and it’s nice to see that extend to not just representation, which they do very well, but also just ensuring more people can consume and enjoy that media. Ubisoft has also been doing a really great job with it. So by their forces combined, it makes for a very wonderful experience. I’ve never played a game with better audio narration than Star Wars Outlaws. What was the process of finding actors and writing a script for this? Jenna: Yeah, I can answer that part of it since I’m one of, I guess, three writers, technically now with the DLC who worked on Star Wars Outlaws. So audio description has been around for movies and TV shows for several decades now, but it only started coming to video games two years ago. It’s still very new and every game engine is different. So the workflow is going to be different for each of them. But it’s challenging because instead of one contiguous piece of media that you write for from start to finish, you’re given dozens or hundreds of videos to cover and describe the cinematics that actually end up going into the game. Then you have to get additional context to fill in any storytelling that goes on between those cinematics. So Star Wars Outlaws has audio description only for certain cinematics and not during gameplay portions. So then we have to be given additional reference materials to fill in who’s this character? Were they introduced outside of the cinematics? What order do these cinematics go in? What is this thing called? That came up a lot because it’s the Star Wars universe! Then we had it once we had all of the scripts together we would send them to our lovely narrator Ramya who worked her magic. And I think one of the biggest challenges Ramya that you had to deal with was that we had to bombard you with pronunciations for all of these characters and races and unique items to the Star Wars universe. Ramya: Yeah, it was quite fun actually. Sometimes we’d be like, what do you think it’s supposed to sound like? And then we’d be like, well let’s just not guess, let’s ask somebody. Jenna: Yeah we had to go back and forth a couple of times because there were races that had not appeared in video media or in a format where the race would be called out in an auditory manner. So all we had were like text references. So we actually had to go back to Ubisoft and say, how is this one pronounced? Those were just a handful of several challenges that you come across, but I think one of the biggest challenges is maintaining continuity in between all of those different chunks. From a writing perspective, because we have to know when a character is introduced, what their pronouns are, what their alien race is. And then, Ramya, you had to worry about maintaining narrative tone in what might have been cutscenes that happened one right after the other. Ramya: Yeah, definitely with narration and especially with pacing like in Star Wars Outlaw, whether it’s story scenes or actual gameplay, you get a lot of conflict and fight scenes and things like that. Sometimes you’ve got to squeeze in a description into a two second, three second slot and rush through it because you’re matching the pace of the activity that’s going on, but also you’ve got to get it in. So there is a lot of that kind of tonal assistance that I get with whoever’s teching with me, the audio engineer. And we always find it really fun. Like do that again, but you know, she’s actually scared, not happy. It’s also interesting if I can add coming from the perspective of a blind narrator because sometimes I think people might have the opportunity to watch the things that they’re going to be narrating and kind of get a cinematic context that way, a visual context. But for me, that’s not necessarily the case. Sometimes I just go with the amount of space I have to narrate something and the script. Like it’s a very dry recording process. You might get some sound around it and need to be able to slot it in or punch it in, but not always and so sometimes I’m honestly just sort of making up whatever is going on based on just the limited context that I have. Jenna: This is something that’s especially difficult for game projects in general, because when we’re working on writing or recording the script for audio description that goes into the game, the game itself is never finished by the time I look at it. There’s always going to be things that are missing. So there might be an explosion on screen, but the sound effect isn’t done for it yet. So you don’t hear the explosion. There might be climactic music that’s planned for like a really big swell and the music’s just not in there yet which can make that even even more difficult when trying to fill in the context of what the mood should be and what the director’s intent is for the scene. So we do the best we can given the context available to us. So speaking of there being parts of the game that posed different challenges for audio narration for different reasons, are there any particular scenes in Star Wars Outlaws that come to mind as the scenes that were the hardest to work on? Ramya: Great question. Considering I can’t remember all the scenes, it’s interesting to try and think. I probably would have to actually play the game to really understand where my voice fits into all this, if I’m being truly honest with you. Because that’s just the way it is. It’s like you narrate before you know the full script of the project or the full context of the storylines even. I’ve done this with movies as well. And then later on, I’d watch the movie and I’m like, oh, I was so off. Jenna: But you are your own worst critic. I think you did an excellent job. Ramya: Thank you. I will say the hardest for me was the more energetic scenes, like in the middle of conflict or fight scenes or action items, because I’d have to deliver like rushed or angry material and kind of predict the way that the characters are feeling or showing up in those scenes and hopefully feel like I’m matching the tone. I loved anything with Nix though. Nix was cute, anything Nix does is adorable. Jenna: Ramiya, I’m gonna gas you up a little bit because I think you’re way too critical of yourself. So I’ve been playing through the game and I’m almost finished with it and I haven’t come across a single scene where it seems like your narrative tone is off compared to the scene. I think you did an excellent job and I’ll just talk about one example, I came across my favourite scene just a couple of days ago. So spoiler warning , this includes a reveal that happens near the end of the game. So be careful if you haven’t gotten to this part of the game yet. But there’s a scene near the end where Sliro is in his office and unexpectedly Darth Vader walks in and it’s Darth Vader doing what he does best. He’s just throwing the force around and bullying some Imperial officers into submission. And it’s this really cool scene where he breaks all the glass in the room and then makes it hover in a very threatening manner. And Ramya, you nailed the very ominous sort of threatening tone of that scene. also just like, there was very little dialogue during that scene comparatively. It gave us so much time to describe that the fact that you were able to chew on that and and really work with that was really fantastic. That’s my favourite scene that you did. Ramya: Thank you. And I was just going to say, like as a continuation of that, that’s my favourite stuff to narrate. We’re talking more prose, more storytelling, not just a description of actions, like a scene that’s unfolding in front of you. I loved working around that for narration. And there were a few calm moments in this game, it wasn’t all just fight scenes, And during those moments you got to expand on the visuals around you. That was lovely to narrate. Obviously when working in active game development there are money and time constraints that can get in the way of doing everything you want. If you had an unlimited budget and no time constraints at all are there audio narration features you’d like to implement? Jenna: Love this question! Obviously, I would just want to see the scope of audio description explored to its maximum. We’ve seen a lot of developers explore audio description in new ways in the couple years since audio description has started being implemented in AAA releases. But I would want to see that expanded to like descriptions that aren’t time limited. So optional player triggered descriptions of character cosmetics, environments, like just the appearance of how a menu is laid out. Are you using a really cool scripted font? Are you using a high contrast neon? Does the menu look like a flickering neon sign? I wanna know that. Like there’s just so many cool design elements that should be described in my opinion. Ramya: Yeah, you’re 100% spot on. That’s exactly what I think about as well, there’s so much just about the vibe of a video game. You know, when you put it on or turn it up or whatever, you’re in a zone, you’re entering a universe. And the way that we think of audio description at its bare minimum is, what allows me to play this video game? What allows me to actually go through it and be a player. But that’s not the scope of a video game, right? Like that’s the bare minimum. I want to know everything. What are my weapon choices? Cool. But what do they look like? What do they feel like? How does my player hold it? And then everything else around it, like you said, the aesthetics of environments, of different places, the stages of fight scenes. Just so many things people are able to lock in as they’re playing that adds to the full experience of a video game that currently we’re not doing. Like it’s not being offered. To experience that now you’d probably have to take a snapshot and run it through an AI or sit with somebody else who’s gaming with you and be able to talk about the aesthetics and how things look cool. But when I was growing up playing anything, I would love to go back into those video games and know exactly what I was doing. Jenna: Just like going beyond just functionality, it would be nice to have full immersion. Also, I think we should start a hashtag #DescribeTheVibe. Star Wars Outlaws was nominated for Innovation in Accessibility at The Game Awards, how does it feel to be part of a project that received such positive acclaim for its accessibility features? Ramya: Yeah, I mean, of course, it’s fabulous in the sense that we know this kind of influences big games, big companies, big universes in video gaming. When you think of accessibility being talked about in the context of just like enormous universes or enormous video game opportunities. It’s huge. It’s huge for the community. It’s huge for the conversations. It’s huge for next steps for empowerment and influence and inspiration around accessibility. And like we’ve pointed out, Jenna and I through these conversations, we want more. So the more we can get it out there the better. We want to hear these conversations. Wasn’t this audio description awesome? Or wasn’t the narration on this so good? Or hey, did you even realize there was audio description in video games? Whoever is talking about it, right? Then you get the ripple effect of big outlets picking it up and awards being given. Jenna: Ubisoft definitely deserves the recognition. They put a lot of work into all of the accessibility features, not just the vision accessibility. They picked up several other nominations with the Game Accessibility Conference Awards. But like Ramya was saying, it’s nice to see accessibility features making it into the zeitgeist, it’s nice to see it being talked about more in the mainstream. And I would say that people are much more likely to explore all of the settings available in a video game than they are to look at the spoken language options on a major streaming service, because that’s where audio description exists in that. So it’s cool that it’s more likely that someone will stumble across this feature that might be very helpful to them and they just didn’t know about it. Thanks to Jenna and Ramya for their time. Star Wars Outlaws is out now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S|X.

2025-01-24T12:00:48,IDUN – Frontline Survival review,"Tower Defence is a genre I’ve always played sporadically, and usually only when it’s bolted onto the side of something else. It’s rare that I ever get into the nitty gritty of tower defence in its purest form. I prefer a narrative, or at the very least some form of character progression like an RPG or Metroidvania . But IDUN – Frontline Survival surprised me with just how quickly it sucked me in. Primarily, you play as Ham, a gruff but snarky security officer whose job it is to oversee the defence of a mostly automated mining operation on the planet Idun. Aided by his daughter Ro-ro and a handful of unlockable allies, Ham is often the guy in the thick of the action when deadly alien vermin begin attacking the operation from every direction. Ham is just one guy, and will be swarmed in seconds without the aid of equipment deployed via orbital drop. Turrets, flamethrowers, towers and upgrades can be called down, earned with material you pull out of the ground during the mission. The action is fast, the deployment instant, the gratification immediate. But that’s not the cool part. The cool part is that none of your placements are permanent. Just as you can move Ham and his allies around to fill gaps in your defences, you can also move turrets and other items at zero cost and with no wait times. Too many bugs amassing to the east? Drop your turrets there while Ham and his buddies finish off stragglers to the west. In between, you can use a powerful “sky gun” to obliterate enemies in real-time to give your guys on the ground some help. Periodically you’ll receive golden packages you can click on to get new upgrades, more guns, or boosts and buffs, and as missions are often short and frantic you’ll need to use everything. IDUN is designed to be challenging, and taking your eye off the ball for even a few seconds will see you overrun. Other characters soon join you, such as sharpshooter Rayne and melee-focused Q, and with them comes more of a focus on narrative. IDUN – Frontline Survival exists in quite a fleshed-out universe, and the colourful, well-drawn characters reflect this universe. They mostly squabble, but also exposit plenty, and build the world. It’s a good-looking game too. The mission levels aren’t super detailed but they do run the gamut of alien landscapes. The character portraits during conversations are gorgeous though. It also sounds pretty good, with fully voiced dialogue and some great sound effects. It’s quite satisfying to slam turrets into the ground and mow down hordes of giant bugs with the sky-gun. IDUN is seriously frantic at times though. It barely gives you a moment to think once an onslaught begins, and while it’s really fun to micromanage the defence in this way, it can get stressful. Once you start losing turrets it’s hard to unlock replacements fast enough, and repairs aren’t always an option. As I said, it’s challenging by design, and the higher the difficulty you choose per mission, the better the rewards you’ll earn. These rewards are then used to unlock various upgrades to your defences, research new items, and level up your characters and their gear. The between-mission hub allows you to spend resources in any way you choose, though you won’t spend a great deal of time there. It’s interesting to note that IDUN also plays really well on Steam Deck despite not being verified at time of writing. The small screen can make it tricky to read some of the dialogue, but it runs really smoothly and is easy to control even when in the thick of the action. IDUN – Frontline Survival is an interesting take on the tower defence genre with likeable characters and a fun story. It’s quite unique in its mechanics, which keeps it feeling fresh throughout. It’s not super easy though, so be prepared for a little frustration as you get to grips with it.

2025-01-24T11:00:31,White Knuckle to be published by DreadXP,"Indie publisher DreadXP teams with developer Dark Machine Games to bring first-person speed climbing horror White Knuckle to fans. The game is set in a huge underground megastructure that features intense action, intricate momentum-based movement mechanics, and survival horror. To celebrate the announcement, a trailer has been released to give players an idea of what to expect. Thrust into the role of a lone climber, players must attempt to ascend SUB-STRUCTURE 17, an enormous, crumbling complex buried deep underground. With ten thousand meters of concrete and decay above and an encroaching ooze below, every climb is a race against time. Navigate perilous environments, using a blend of precision movement, sharp reflexes, and resource management to scale deteriorating walls, leap across perilous gaps, dodge traps, and avoid the deadly forces lurking in the shadows. White Knuckle will task players with managing a limited inventory so they don’t become encumbered as they climb the creepy structures of SUB-STRUCTURE 17. Resource management and quick thinking are going to be just two of the factors players are going to have to think about as obstacles become tougher to overcome the higher they climb, with each new threat offering a host of challenges. Evil exists throughout the terrifying structure as the environment becomes more and more hostile, forcing players to continually change their approach and strategies to stay alive. From the dry, dusty Silos to the putrid sewers of the Pipeworks and the haunted piers of Habitation, each area presents a distinct set of trials and enemies, all contributing to a sense of ever-growing tension. Run, jump, and climb to survive… or slip and face your doom. Every leap could be the last and it’s a long way down… White Knuckle will be launching on Early Access via Steam later this year, but players wanting to play a little earlier can now dive into the demo, already featuring over 1,000 overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam. .

2025-01-24T10:47:36,GameSir G7 HE Iron Man Limited Edition Controller review,"If you’re after reliable, well-made and, above all, affordable controllers for PC or console, you can’t really do better than GameSir. The GameSir G7 HE Iron Man Limited Edition Controller, for example, is not only well-priced for a special edition pad, it’s also really well put-together too. It is a wired model, so if that’s a deal-breaker for you when it comes to handing over £60 for a controller, you’re best off looking elsewhere. But if you don’t mind plug-and-play and you’re looking for a stunning piece of kit sporting the branding of everyone’s favourite iron-clad billionaire, you could do worse. Gleaming gold and hot rod red may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but the audacious colour scheme is absolutely gorgeous in the right set-up. A gold-embossed Iron Man emblazons the right palm grip, with the symbol of Tony Stark’s unique mini-reactor on the left. Though, the G7 HE isn’t all about the looks. It also features some really nice quality-of-life stuff under the hood that will make a difference to die-hard gamers. For a start, it boasts Hall Effect thumbsticks and triggers, which make it practically immune to ever developing stick-drift. It doesn’t feature an omni-directional D-pad, so fight fans might be put off, but there’s built-in haptic feedback that you can adjust and customise using GameSir’s own Nexus app. This also allows you to customise the extra buttons and set up your own shortcuts. A 3.5mm mic jack lets you play sound through the controller, with a microphone switch baked in. In my hands, the G7 HE Iron Man controller feels weighty but comfortable. I’d rather a controller have some heft to it, and the 227g G7 HE doesn’t feel “heavy”, but doesn’t feel insignificant either. The buttons feel just springy enough, but the sticks themselves are the real MVPs. Hall Effect is one thing, but they feel so smooth and frictionless that playing fast-paced games like shooters is a joy. CHECK IT OUT: GameSir Tarantula Pro Controller | Review Bundled with a 9-foot cable, the G7 HE Iron Man Controller competes well with wired options, though certain other features seem somewhat superfluous at the time of writing. For example, you can remove the faceplate to replace it was something else, but at this point I can’t find other options. Although I’m an Iron Man fan so I can’t imagine doing that anyway. Ultimately, stunning aesthetic aside, the G7 HE Iron Man controller is still a fantastic gamepad. For £60 you’re not only getting a unique-looking pad, you’re also getting something that feels responsive, well-made, sturdy, and reliable. The wire might be an issue for some, but if you overlook that, it’s a solid option for PC, Switch, or Xbox gamers.

2025-12-17T10:04:11,All Anime Celestial X Secret Boss Locations,"Secret bosses in Anime Celestial X drop more gold as well as artifacts you can use to boost your damage. That said they are all hidden across their respective worlds so I'll show you where they are and where you can accept quests to defeat them. Here are all Anime Celestial X secret boss locations . Table of contents All Secret Boss Locations in Anime Celestial X World 1 Namek Secret Boss - Broly World 2 Shinobi Village Secret Boss - Madara World 3 Hunters Domain Secret Boss - Meruem World 4 Desert Kings Secret Boss - Doflamingo All Secret Boss Locations in Anime Celestial X You can reach all Anime Celestial X secret boss locations on foot without any flying mounts like Nimbus. Below you'll find step-by-step guides to find each secret boss separated by Worlds. I'll also show you where to find Alucard/World Line Giver that gives you the quests to slay those secret bosses . World 1 Namek Secret Boss - Broly Image by Destructoid Image by Destructoid To reach World 1's secret boss Broly, follow these steps with pictures above in mind: From the original World 1 spawn look to your right and use a nearby house to jump up to the hill where the Freeza boss spawns (You can also reach Freeza by just following the main road). Next to Freeza, you can find Alucard/World Line Giver that gives you the secret boss quest for Broly. To reach Broly, look to the left of Freeza and you can see some platform islands you need to jump across. Use double jump and dash to cross the platform islands and reach the other side where you need to take the upper cliff. Go around the cliff and you'll see Broly. World 2 Shinobi Village Secret Boss - Madara Image by Destructoid The secret boss for World 2 is Madara and here's how to find him: From the original World 2 spawn, follow the main road and at the crossroads take the right path toward the bridge. Cross the bridge and enter the town area heading straight ahead until you reach the Pain/Nagato boss. Look to the left of Pain/Nagato boss and you'll see Alucard/World Line Giver that gives you the secret boss quest. Double jump up the building next to Alucard and then double jump to the taller building to the right. Madara will be on top of that taller building that's right behind Pain/Nagato. World 3 Hunters Domain Secret Boss - Meruem Image by Destructoid Meruem is the secret boss for World 3 Hunters Domain and here's how to reach him: Follow the main road from the original World 3 spawn and take the right path at the crossroads. Keep heading down the right path toward the bridge and waterfall. Once near the waterfall, double jump toward the waterfall and dash to enter inside the waterfall. Meruem will be inside the waterfall. As for the secret boss quest giver Alucard , he'll be at the end of the map following the right-side road and going past the waterfall until you reach the Chrollo boss (Alucard is next to Chrollo). World 4 Desert Kings Secret Boss - Doflamingo Image by Destructoid Image by Destructoid The World 4 boss is Doflamingo and you can find him like this: From the World 4 spawn, follow the main road and take a right at the crossroad with the tall tower. Keep heading right down that road across the bridge and into the town area. Follow the main road after the bridge until you reach the Crocodile boss. The secret boss quest giver Alucard/World Line Giver will be right in front of Crocodile. From the Crocodile boss, look to the left to see a tall tower, Doflamingo is at the top. To climb the tower, jump on the wooden logs protruding from the tower. When you've jumped on the first one, you can just alternate jumping toward your camera then double jump back onto the next wooden beam/log until you reach the top. Doflamingo is at the top of the tower (In an older update, Doflamingo was spawning behind the building that's behind Crocodile). And those are all secret boss locations in Anime Celestial X.

2025-12-17T10:01:43,How to solve ARC Raiders Secret Button puzzle and get the Guitar,"ARC Raiders ' Cold Snap update has quietly added a Secret Button puzzle for players to decode, and cracking it successfully will lead you to the legendary Guitar item on a raid. There are 15 secret red buttons spread all around the Buried City map. Things would have been pretty easy if all we had to do was to press all the buttons on a single raid. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complex, and this guide will help you to complete the puzzle without any hassle. Table of contents Button 1 Button 2 Button 3 Button 4 Button 5 Button 6 Button 7 Button 8 Button 9 Button 10 Button 11 Button 12 Button 13 Button 14 Button 15 ARC Raiders Buried City Secret Button puzzle solution Before I deep dive into the solution, it's worth thanking ARC Raiders Puzzle Discord for figuring out the solution. This is by far the most complex puzzle that I have ever encountered in the game. To complete the puzzle, you'll have to press the secret red buttons, which are spread all over Buried City. Here's the catch: you'll have to press the buttons in a pre-determined order . That's right, there's only one correct order of activating the buttons. Every button has a corresponding musical note (you just have to pay attention to the button and ensure that the correct order is maintained). If someone breaks the sequence by pressing the wrong button, you'll have to start the entire process from scratch on a fresh raid. Pressing any wrong button, even once, will break the complete sequence, and you won't be able to gain access to the legendary Guitar. Screenshot and remix by  Destructoid If you observe the screenshot above, you'll get the exact order of how you should press the buttons. We begin from the button marked as ""1"" and work all the way to ""15"". Here's a quick note on how to locate the secret buttons at each location. Do note that they're not that hard to find when you're at the correct locations. Button 1 The first button is present at Plaza Rosa. Take the stairs and go upstairs. Turn right, head straight, and there will be a kitchen cabinet to your right. The button is just by this kitchen cabinet. Button 2 Image via Embark The second one is inside the Galleria . Approach from the roof hatch, go down using the zipline. Turn left twice, and the button will be to your left. Button 3 Image via Embark/Chico_Stick The third one is all the way to the west in the Warehouse. It's located on the roof, in-between two structures. Button 4 Image via Embark The fourth one is in the middle of the Marano Park. It's inside a small room in the park at the marked location. Button 5 Image via Embark The fifth button is slightly harder to find. Head to the Grandioso Apartments and take the zipline from the bottom.  Go all the way to the top, turn left, and head straight to the balcony.  Head straight, and you'll find a room with glass walls to your left. Break the glass, and the button will be on the ground the sofa. Button 6 Image via Embark/Lu_2 The sixth button is by a ledge of a cyan-colored house at the Piazza Arbusto location. Look for the ledge on the second floor of the building (outside, and not inside), and you'll find the button. Button 7 Image via Embark The seventh button is inside a bus near the Library building. Button 8 Image via  Embark The eighth button can be on a house near the Corso da Vinci. Enter the marked building from the left (red-colored) using the broken wall. Go inside, turn left, head straight, and turn left. The button will be on the floor of this room. Button 9 Image via Embark Button 9 is in the Buried Properties, by the Raider Den depot. You'll find a dilapidated house, and the button will be hidden beside a generator. Button 10 Image via Embark To find the tenth button, enter the Hospital from the front and turn left. You'll find a set of stairs; the button is under the stairs. Button 11 Image via Embark The eleventh button is under the Abandoned Highway. Keep following the Abandoned Highway till the bridge snaps in two. Drop down to a house's roof on the left, and again turn left (on the roof itself). Just take a few steps forward, and the button will be to your left. Button 12 Image via Embark The twelfth one is in the Church Ruins. It's on the roof of the western edge of the building. Button 13 Image via Embark To find button 13, reach the attic of the Santa Maria houses. Take the stairs to the top, and you'll find a zipline on the top floor to reach the attic. Button 14 The fourteenth button is located in a small tower at the marked location ""14"" on the screenshot above  (map). Button 15 Image via Embark The final one is in the Red Tower.  You'll find the door on the ground floor (enter through one of the broken doors) and just press the button. If done correctly, a tune will play, followed by the door (on the screenshot above) opening for you to find the Guitar and a host of other items.

2025-12-16T22:13:00,Fimbulwinter Stitch god rolls and how to get them in Destiny 2,"The Dawning's Fimbulwinter Stitch may look like a rocket sidearm, but it uses primary ammo. And though that may be enough to take some of the magic out of the Destiny 2 weapon, its god rolls may make you reconsider. Though Destiny 2 had its share of Arc sidearms almost religiously before Renegades , the Star Wars -styled expansion brought a pistol with access to great perks for light-blue builds. Here are our god rolls for Fimbulwinter Stitch in Destiny 2 , based on data from d2foundry.gg . Fimbulwinter Stitch PvE god rolls in Destiny 2 Dawning 2025 has three new weapons up for grabs. Image via Bungie Barrel: Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, or Polygonal Rifling Mag: High-Caliber Rounds, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, or Light Mag Third column: Rapid Hit, Trickle Charge, or Supercharged Magazine Fourth column: Voltshot, Jolting Feedback, or Rolling Storm Honorable mention: Kill Clip This sidearm has quite a few good perks to pore over. In the third column, keep your eyes peeled for Rapid Hit, Trickle Charge, or Supercharged Magazine to help you with reloads. Each perk does it differently: Rapid Hit is a flat boost to reload speed and stability after landing precision hits, while Trickle Charge refills your magazine every time you get or unleash Bolt Charge , and Supercharged Magazine has the same effect while you're Amplified. If you don't have Arc on your kit, however, Rapid Hit is universal, and you can get mileage out of Loose Change if the perk in your other column has elemental synergy. The second perk column uses Fimbulwinter Stitch as a generator for your elemental keywords, which works much better if you're using Arc. Voltshot works perfectly to apply Jolt and get a little more add clear on a weapon used for red-bars. Rolling Storm lets you gather Bolt Charge on kills, and Jolting Feedback lets you proc Jolt after shooting an enemy enough times. Kill Clip appears as a no-frills, universal option for a damage boost, which works even if you don't have anything Arc among your tools. Redirection would have been killer if this were a rocket sidearm, but as it stands, you're likely better off swapping to a different weapon when facing orange bars or above, even with a damage buff. That way, you can use a harder-hitting tool to take down sturdier foes. All in all, your picks for this weapon will depend on your build and how much (or how little) you'd like to use Arc with it. Renegades brought strong contenders for your Energy slot—Psi Aeterna and Uncivil Discourse chief among them—so there are other items to work into a build, but it's worth keeping a copy of this weapon in your vault. How to get Fimbulwinter Stitch in Destiny 2 Eva's little gift for you. Image via Bungie Fimbulwinter Stitch is only available during The Dawning. It can drop from Distorted Engrams, select event activities, and by opening the gifts you receive after delivering cookies to NPCs, which should drop it at quite a high tier. In addition to the new weapons, this year's event brought two new cookie recipes: Dark Matter Drizzlers for the Dean of the Aionians and Peanut Butter Paw Prints for Archie , giving you two more cookies to bake—and more chances to grab this weapon.

2025-12-16T22:11:30,All Dawning Recipes and ingredients in Destiny 2,"The Dawning is upon Destiny 2 , bringing back the classic cookie-baking, recipe-collecting, ingredient-hoarding fun as usual (though without the beloved bounties this year). The tried-and-true tradition of gifting your favorite NPCs for loot remains, though, and this time, the goodies are high-end. Baking cookies is at the heart of the Dawning. Delivering baked treats to any of the eligible NPCs has a chance of giving you an item called A Gift In Return, and if you're lucky, opening it may get you special versions of the new event weapons. Opening gifts has been giving us Tier Five versions of the Dawning weapons, which include a returning linear fusion rifle and two powerful newcomers. Knowing the best goodies to make is vital, so here's a list of all ingredients and recipes for this year's Dawning. All Dawning Ingredients in Destiny 2 This year, you can bake cookies for the Dean of the Aionians. Image via Bungie Dawning ingredients come in two rarities: Uncommon and Rare. Uncommon materials drop depending on what enemy type you kill, while blue ones drop depending on how you got that kill. The uncommon elements are: Vex Milk: Vex Ether Cane: Fallen Cabal Oil: Cabal Chitin Powder : Hive Taken Butter: Taken Dark Ether Cane: Scorn That said, there are no ingredients tied specifically to Dread enemies this year, and it may take a while to get there—if Bungie ever adds that to the fold. Until then, we can be happy we don't have to shoot Barrier Grims to bake treats for Ghost or something similar, and I hope I haven't just jinxed that into existence next year. You can also give Archie cookies, even if he doesn't eat them.

All cookies in this list require 15 Essence of Dawning to make, though masterworking Eva Levante's oven brings that number down to 10.

Instead, it happens passively as you do any activity in Destiny 2 . You should get enough ingredients for cookies just by playing, but if you have a special NPC in mind, you can also focus on baking their favorite recipe.

2025-12-16T22:07:23,How to get and use the Shaker in ARC Raiders,"The Cold Snap update in ARC Raiders has added a fair amount of new items, and you can add the Shaker to create new tunes in the freeze. If you have been looking for something aside from the Flute to play in ARC Raiders , the Cold Snap update has good news. The Shaker is a peculiar-looking item that can be played to create musical tunes. To do so, you'll first have to find the item, and this guide will provide you with all the necessary information. Table of contents How to find the Shaker in ARC Raiders How to use a Shaker in ARC Raiders How to find the Shaker in ARC Raiders Sadly, the Shaker doesn't appear to have a fixed location. It can pop up on any of the available maps, and its location will be random. Unlike items like Candleberries , you don't have to depend on the Cold Snap modifier. Screenshot and remix by Destructoid The item appears to be quite rare, and so far, I have only managed to find it once. I found it randomly in a container on one of the floors in the Research and Administration building . I have marked its location on the screenshot above, but it's a pretty popular spot. The Research and Administration building offers some notable loot that will be immensely helpful to power up your character. It also frequently spawns plenty of keys that allow you to access locked locations on different maps. If you're lucky like me, you can also end up finding the Shaker. Research and Administration building in ARC Raiders. Screenshot by Destructoid Do remember that the Shaker can spawn at practically any location, and you'll mostly find them in different containers. Hence, make sure to breach and search as many containers as possible. How to use a Shaker in ARC Raiders The Shaker doesn't have much of a practical use. However, you can use it from the emote wheel if it's present in your inventory. If you're on PC, press the Q button and then hover over to the Shaker. If you're on consoles, you can do the same by pressing the LB (Xbox)/L1 (PlayStation) button. Be careful since the additional noise can attract nearby ARCs and expose you to incoming heat. In simple words, it's used in the same way as a Flute, and it's not part of any additional quest.

2025-12-16T21:54:55,What is Warzone Holiday Rush? New game mode explained,"CODMAS is here, Call of Duty gamers, and it means it's time for the Holiday Rush in Warzone. This limited-time mode is all about being Naughty or Nice, and it's got some good potential for fun or just classic XP farming, whatever you're into. Either way, it's time to celebrate the holidays in Warzone by dropping in for a silly, respawn-enabled game mode. Here's everything you need to know about Warzone Holiday Rush . Warzone Holiday Rush Screenshot by Destructoid The Holiday Rush mode in Warzone is basically a massive version of capture the flag . One team is Naughty and the other team is Nice, with each team having 36 players. The mode is played on small POI sections of Verdansk like the Promenade area. Periodically, gifts will spawn on the map and the teams have to fight over them. The Naughty team must bring the gifts back to ovens on the map to incinerate the gifts, while the Nice team must capture them to deliver them to Christmas trees. There are two of each of these goals on the map. Holiday Rush takes place over matches that last 20 minutes long, but the first team to reach 15 presents will win. Whichever team has delivered or incinerated the most gifts wins the match if the goal of 15 is not reached. Occasionally, a gold present will spawn on the map. Delivering or incinerating it will count as three points, so make sure to prioritize these. Or just sit on a rooftop and farm weapon XP and sniper headshots, it's really up to you. There's also loot caches you can farm for gear and buy stations for you to loot up further. The mode is straightforward, but also necessary if you want to unlock specific event challenges before it comes to an end, so it's worth knowing what you're getting into when trying to unlock the Sokol 545 or free animated camo that's locked behind the LTM. Screenshot by Destructoid Due to the mode's length and play style, it's a great way to farm XP, camo challenges, and weapon levels, along with challenges for the Naughty & Nice limited time event . The mode also supports wall-jumping and grappling hooks, so get in there and have some fun. The post What is Warzone Holiday Rush?

2025-12-16T21:24:49,"Baldur’s Gate, Divinity CEO explains studio’s usage of AI for concept art: ‘We use AI tools to explore references’","The excitement for Larian Studios next title, the gory and visceral Divinity , was hijacked by some AI-related rage on social media today, because not even the Baldur's Gate 3 studio is immune from it. Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke was caught heat online earlier today after a Bloomberg interview was published this afternoon, stating how ""Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency."" Image via Larian Studios Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that ""the use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian,"" but Vincke explained that ""at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it."" ""Holy fuck guys we’re not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI,"" he said in a post on X/Twitter several hours after the article went live. ""We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do."" Vincke went further, saying how Larian uses generative AI ""to explore things"" in concept art, like ""references, just like we use Google and art books,"" and ""at the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art."" It feels like this is quickly becoming the norm in game dev. For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 caught a lot of flak earlier this year for what many view as AI-generated art in cosmetics like calling cards . At that time, Activision put out a statement, and it sounds similar to this Larian situation. ""Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players,"" Activision said. ""Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzyVeAG00w Honestly, it seems like this has become a standard in game development. And I don't think it's going anywhere. The demon has been let out of its cage and it's here to stay, for better or worse, since there's little to no regulation on it in general. If GenAI is used to help creatives with mundane tasks rather than replace them, then it's likely going to continue for the foreseeable future. As it advances, however, the latter seems to become a potential issue, and that's what's scariest about all of this technology.

2025-12-16T20:27:46,How to get Ether Cane and Dark Ether Cane in Destiny 2’s Dawning,"A Destiny 2 adagio says ""the line between Light and Dark is so very thin,"" but the line between Ether Cane and Dark Ether Cane is a lot thicker. These two ingredients are available as part of the Dawning, and you must get at least one of each to get the full taste of the event. These two are uncommon ingredients in Destiny 2 , meaning you have a chance of dropping them whenever you defeat a specific type of enemy. They both appear in the event quest as well, which tasks you with baking Dark Matter Drizzlers and Peanut Butter Paw Prints . Here's how you can get this duo of materials in Destiny 2 . How to get Ether Cane in Destiny 2 The Cosmodrome is filled with Fallen enemies to take on. Image via Bungie Ether Cane has a chance of dropping every time you take down a Fallen enemy in Destiny 2 , regardless of where in the system you are. If you're just looking to grab a handful of those quickly, we recommend heading to a destination area with Fallen, such as the Steppes and the Divide in the Cosmodrome or Trostland in the EDZ. If you'd like to farm the Portal while you're at it, however, some Solo Ops activities like K1 and Caldera can have Fallen as the opposing faction, though they rotate daily. You can also pick other activities that have them as your foes, such as Ketchcrash (Arena Ops). The faction modifiers can tell you what foes you're up against. How to get Dark Ether Cane in Destiny 2 Take down Fikrul's children for this ingredient. Image via Bungie The Scorn are corrupted versions of the Fallen made with Dark Ether, so naturally, Dark Ether Cane drops by taking down those enemies. They're on the rarer side as an enemy faction, but you can find them in Nightmare Containment in the Arena Ops playlist or inside the Bay of Drowned Wishes Lost Sector in the Divalian Mists in the Dreaming City, which is our guaranteed spot to farm them. After you've had enough of those ingredients, you can bake the required pastries for the NPCs. Delivering them has a chance of giving you a special item called A Gift In Return, which may contain event weapons and other goodies.

2025-12-16T19:59:40,How to get Empty Wine Bottle in ARC Raiders,"The Cold Snap update in ARC Raiders has arrived with the Flickering Flames project, with different stages, and there's suddenly been an increase in demand for Empty Wine Bottle. The Empty Wine Bottle has been present in ARC Raiders since the game's launch on Oct. 30. Until now, its only use (as far as I know) has been as a trinket that you can sell for a lot of cash. But you'll have to find this item if you're looking to complete the Flickering Flames project as quickly as possible. While finding the Empty Wine Bottle can be a matter of luck, this guide will list down the best possible spots to make things easier for you. Best spots to farm Empty Wine Bottle in ARC Raiders The Empty Wine Bottle can be found across all maps (I have never found it on Stell Montis, incidentally). It's a common-rarity item, so finding it shouldn't be much of a problem. I started my search for it on the Dam Battlegrounds map. I found the one Empty Wine Bottle in the Ruby Residence area of Dam Battlegrounds. Ruby Residence and Research Administration Building. Screenshot and remix by Destructoid This massive building has multiple containers that you can search for valuable loot. It's also a Residential area, and I feel items like a Wine Bottle spawn more commonly in such places. You'll typically find them in breachable containers, but they can also be found on shelves occasionally. Ultimately, it all boils down to luck, and the Ruby Residence isn't the only spot. However, it's just a location that could help you find the item quicker. You can also try the Research and Administration building on the Dam Battlegrounds map. Another great area to search is the apartment buildings and houses located in Piazza Rosa on the Buried City map. I won't mention a specific spot, as Empty Wine Bottle has been pretty common. Screenshot and remix by Destructoid Always try to search on a map that doesn't have the Cold Snap modifier active. The Cold Snap modifier raises the base rarity of items that you can find on the map. The increased rarity buff will make it harder for you to find common items like the Empty Wine Bottle. While you only require one Empty Wine Bottle, you'll need to find a lot of Candleberries if you want to complete the Flickering Flames project before it expires in January.

If you're as excited as I am about the upcoming update, this guide will help you keep track of when the update goes live. Palworld Home Sweet Home release countdown Palworld's Home Sweet Home update will be going live on all platforms on Dec. 17. We have known this date since the trailer was launched back in November. It's unlikely that there will be any change to the schedule now, with only a few more hours to go. The countdown below will expire once the update goes live.

The exact schedule was followed last time during the launch of the Tides of Terraria update. Most of the regions will have the update live on Dec. 17, while it will be Dec. 16 if you're in the US. Home Sweet Home is an official collab with ULTRAKILL , introducing new elements never seen before in Palworld . You'll be able to apply brand new armor parts and use a new weapon directly influenced by the content of ULTRAKILL . However, Pocketpair hasn't shown all the new content to us as of writing.

2025-12-16T19:27:33,How to get Dark Frosting in the Dawning in Destiny 2,"Preheat your ovens and put on your aprons, because Destiny 2 's Dawning is here. This classic event asks you to hunt down ingredients all over the system, such as Dark Frosting, which you use to bake treats for your allies. Dark Frosting is one of the Dawning's rare ingredients, meaning you get it depending on how you kill enemies. There's a litany of those, allowing you to gift some of your favorite NPCs in the entire Sol System. Here's how you can get this element. How to get Dark Frosting in Destiny 2's Dawning 2025 Stasis is the OG way of getting this item. Image via Bungie This ingredient has a random chance of dropping by killing enemies with Stasis or Strand damage. Like all Dawning ingredients, it's not a guaranteed reward, but it is common enough that you shouldn't have an issue grabbing enough for your baking ventures. Since it's a rare ingredient, it can drop alongside other materials. Defeating a target with a Strand sword, for instance, has a chance to give you Dark Frosting and/or Sharp Flavor. Recipes that use Dark Frosting in Destiny 2's Dawning Strand also works. Image via Bungie In-universe, Dark Frosting ""adds a decadently deep, rich flavor"" to your meals, according to its official description. Unsurprisingly, it's among the least-used of materials, and it only appears in three recipes: Starwort Thins (Elsie Bray/The Exo Stranger) Neomun-Pie (Nimbus) Dark Matter Drizzlers (Dean Rebecca of the Aionians) If you're planning on baking a specific cookie—for instance, Dark Matter Drizzlers—we recommend farming the enemy faction that drops the other ingredient you need. Starwort Thins , for instance, require Dark Ether Cane , which drops from Scorn enemies. If you'd like to get on Elsie Bray's good graces, killing Scorn with Stasis or Strand damage is the way to go. Likewise, to bake Dark Matter Drizzlers, taking down Fallen is a good way to make progress on two fronts at the same time.

2025-12-16T19:04:51,How to bake Peanut Butter Paw Prints in Destiny 2’s Dawning,"The time to bake cookies is upon Destiny 2 with the Dawning event. This time, Eva Levante taught us a new recipe: Peanut Butter Paw Prints, a treat for Archie, the Tower's favorite cybernetic canine. Despite the slew of changes to Destiny 2 since The Edge of Fate , the core of the Dawning remains the same: kill enemies, get ingredients, bake cookies, spread the holiday joy, and hope you get a Holofoil weapon out of your gift. This year, the event's main quest tasks you with baking two new recipes: Dark Matter Drizzlers for the Dean of the Aionians and Peanut Butter Paw Prints for Archie, which shockingly doesn't use any peanut butter. Here's how to make this delicacy in this year's Dawning in Destiny 2 . Peanut Butter Paw Print recipe in Destiny 2's Dawning Eva lets you borrow her oven if you ask her nicely. Image via Bungie Dark Ether Cane Balanced Flavors Essence of Dawning x15 Masterworking Eva Levante's oven drops the cost to 10 Essence of Dawning Dark Ether Cane requires you to defeat Scorn enemies in Destiny 2 , which can be tricky to find. They appear in some Portal activities, such as Nightmare Containment and Kell's Fall, but you can also make a quick detour to the Bay of Drowned Wishes Lost Sector in the Dreaming City . Balanced Flavors , on the other hand, can drop whenever you defeat an enemy with a bow, pulse rifle, scout rifle, or a sniper rifle. Just use one of those weapons to grab this ingredient, but if you'd like to grab Balanced Flavor in droves, we recommend Trinity Ghoul or Graviton Lance. Both excel at taking down red bars, so you'll be swimming in this ingredient in no time. Lastly, Essence of Dawning drops whenever you complete a Portal activity. You can, of course, head to Solo Ops for quick runs, but the Vanguard Alerts playlists are usually fast and rewarding as well. Aim for activities that have Distorted Dawning Engrams as rewards for even more drops. When you have all the ingredients, bake a batch of Peanut Butter Paw Print cookies and bring them to Archie in the Tower's Annex, just opposite the entrance to Ada-1's den. We're not sure if they're dog-safe—especially not ""cybernetic dog we kind of adopted from a derelict facility"" safe—but we know Archie appreciates it all the same.

2025-12-16T18:38:47,How to bake Dark Matter Drizzlers in Destiny 2’s Dawning,"It's been a while since Destiny 2 fans could make new cookies in The Dawning, but this year, they can bake Dark Matter Drizzlers for the Dean of the Aionians in Caldera. It's a simple recipe, and it's required to make the most out of the festivities. Baking all available cookie recipes at least once lets you masterwork Eva Levante's Holiday Oven, which trims the cost of any recipes you make. If you've been an avid chef, you only need the two new recipes in this year's Dawning: Dark Matter Drizzlers for the Dean and Peanut Butter Paw Prints for Archie. Here's how you can make the first of the two new cookies and advance the event quest. How to bake Dark Matter Drizzlers in the Dawning in Destiny 2 Your oven is the most important tool of the Dawning, and we're not exaggerating. Image via Bungie As usual, making Dark Matter Drizzlers requires three ingredients: Ether Cane Dark Frosting Essence of Dawning (15 for the first time and 10 after you've masterworked Eva's oven) Ether Cane drops by killing Fallen enemies anywhere in the system, whether in the Portal or not. One of our go-to spots for this for years has been the Exodus Garden 2A Lost Sector in the Cosmodrome, though any Lost Sector or activity with this enemy faction will do. Dark Frosting , on the other hand, drops by getting kills with Darkness-based elements , meaning Stasis or Strand. Every final blow can drop this, so it shouldn't take too long to grab at least one for your baking needs. Lastly, Essence of Dawning is a reward for completing activities. Your best bet here is doing Portal activities, especially the faster ones. The quickplay Vanguard Alerts playlist is a prime destination for this, since its activities are usually quick and rewarding. The old method of racing through Lost Sectors or public events to stock up on this resource doesn't work anymore. If you just need one of the new cookies for the quest, you should have enough Essence of Dawning that you only need the first two ingredients, so clear out Fallen enemies with any sort of Darkness damage, and you can advance to the next step on the list. After you've made your cookies, hand them to the Dean on Kepler , either in the destination itself or during a Caldera run in Solo Ops.

The latest update has introduced a special condition that applies to all maps. When the Cold Snap conditions are triggered, the maps will have major areas covered by snow. This is when you can find snowballs. This guide will help you find out about the snowballs and explain what you can do with them. Table of contents How to get snowballs in ARC Raiders Can you damage someone with snowballs in ARC Raiders How to get snowballs in ARC Raiders You can only find snowballs when a Cold Snap condition is active on a map. You can check whether the condition is active before beginning a fresh round. You'll have to be careful about the chill that can chip away at your health if you're not careful. Image via Embark You can find snowballs in the group. You can also collect them with your hands. Go close to a snowball, and you'll get the Collect prompt. The snowball will be added to your quick slot, and you can equip it to throw at another player. The process of throwing a snowball is the same as throwing any other throwable. You confirm your aim and then choose the force to determine how far the snowball will go. However, the range of snowballs in ARC Raiders appears to be relatively low, so try to get close to another player before you throw a snowball. Can you damage someone with snowballs in ARC Raiders The snowballs are purely cosmetic, and you can't use them to damage other players. They also don't have any in-game effects, plus it's nearly pointless to bring them back with you. You'll get just 20 coins per snowball, so it's better just to use them in a round before a safe extraction.

While Embark Studios has done a brilliant job with ARC Raiders , The Finals is a pretty underrated title on its own. Unlike ARC Raiders , The Finals is an old-school FPS title that tests your shooting and movement skills in team-based fights. The Cold Snap update has introduced a special promotion campaign that allows you to unlock a new The Finals outfit in the extraction shooter for absolutely free. How to obtain The Finals outfit in ARC Raiders Before you can begin the process, you'll need to install The Finals . Since the game is completely free-to-play (unlike ARC Raiders ), this shouldn't be a problem at all. You can choose to install and play on a platform of your choice, as The Finals is available on both PC and console. Once the installation process is done, load it up. Then, log in to the game with the same Embark account that you use in ARC Raiders . This step is crucial to avoid missing out on the rewards. Once this part is done, complete the following task. Image via Embark Go to the Contracts tab inside The Finals . You'll find a fresh one that requires you to play three matches in any game mode. Proceed to complete three separate games in The Finals. The matches can be across different game modes. Once done, head to ARC Raiders . If you logged in correctly with the proper accounts, the new skin should be available for you almost immediately. Start ARC Raiders and then go to the Raiders tab. Go to Customization, and then select Outfit. If you completed the process correctly, you'll be able to get a new color palette (Red and White) for the Ryder outfit. The Finals heavily influence this color palette.

Experience the next level of visual performance—get the new MO27Q28G on Newegg right now! True Visual Brilliance: The WOLED Difference The MO27Q28G features a 27-inch WOLED panel that represents a fundamental leap in display technology. Traditional IPS monitors use a single backlight that illuminates the entire screen, often causing dark areas to appear gray and reducing overall contrast. In contrast, WOLED technology gives each individual pixel its own light source. Pixels can switch completely off to produce true, absolute black, or illuminate with precision for vibrant color. This results in an infinite contrast ratio, where shadows are genuinely deep and bright elements are strikingly vivid. With 99.5% DCI-P3 color coverage and factory calibration (ΔE < 2) , this monitor delivers cinematic color accuracy directly out of the box. The result is a display capable of both elite gaming performance and professional-grade creative work, all made possible by the purity and control of WOLED. Speed Beyond Measure: 0.03ms Response at 280Hz If you thought OLED was only about picture quality, think again. The MO27Q28G pairs its stunning visuals with a jaw-dropping 280Hz refresh rate and a near-instant 0.03ms Gray-to-Gray response time. Motion is flawlessly smooth, free from smearing or ghosting, giving you the decisive edge in fast-paced competitive titles. From cinematic adventures to high-stakes esports, every frame is rendered with OLED clarity and speed. Designed for the Modern Gamer: Rich Connectivity & Comfort Features The MO27Q28G is built to streamline your setup and protect your eyes during long sessions: Versatile Connectivity: Includes two HDMI 2.1, one DisplayPort 1.4, and a USB-C port with Alternate Mode and 18W Power Delivery—perfect for modern laptops and consoles. Built-in Hub: Features USB 3.2 downstream ports for easy peripheral access. Immersive Audio: Integrated 5W x 2 stereo speakers provide rich, clear sound without extra clutter.

A new report from Alinea Analytics highlights just how much of a boon the awards season has been for E33 (including Destructoid's own GOTY honors), as it has now pushed the game past six million copies sold while also boosting overall engagement on Game Pass. Image via Alinea Analytics My only question is: what the heck took you all so long? Was it stubbornness? Discussion around the game has been glowing since it launched in April ( my review of the game was quite glowing from day one), but now that it's one of the most awarded games ever, you're ready to take the plunge?! I jest. I'm glad people are playing it now, and in droves. Alinea says over 200,000 copies of the game have been sold since TGA aired, with 76 percent of that coming from Steam and 21 percent on PS5. Game Pass, meanwhile, is ""cannibalizing premium sales,"" with 52,000 players trying it on the subscription service. ""The commercial impact of Expedition 33’s historic nine-award sweep at The Game Awards was immediate and dramatic, providing a pretty definitive case study in the power of critical acclaim,"" Alinea's report concluded. ""However, many of the other nominees and winners saw very little boosts (if any) following the event, so TGA is not a guaranteed post-event sales engine for every winner and nominee."" On Steam, E33 still sits at ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews, with over 27,000 recent ones. That number will likely continue to rise, further cementing Sandfall Interactive's debut as one of the biggest and best new IP in recent memory. Image via Sandfall Interactive A new, free update to coincide with all of the awards has only helped the buzz. I haven't had the time to try it just yet, but I have reinstalled the game on Steam, so I'm looking to hopefully give it a shot whenever I have time over the holidays.

2025-12-16T15:26:14,All collectibles for the Equilibrium dungeon in Destiny 2,"The Equilibrium dungeon in Destiny 2 brings a slew of secrets, but it's not all just Star Wars weapons and lightsaber crystals. As usual, Bungie hid some collectibles in different points in the dungeon, which help if you're looking to get the Heirloom Exotic or just want another fashion option. Finding all collectibles grants you the Praxic Drape shader, which is the base tincture used for the dungeon's Jedi-inspired armor, and it also bumps your odds of getting the Heirloom Exotic. Here are the locations of all three of them in the Equilibrium dungeon. Don't forget to pick up the dungeon's secret chests while you're at it. First collectible: On the ship after the first encounter From here, make a right and drop down when you can. Screenshot by Destructoid Clear the first encounter in the dungeon and keep going through the Harvester. After the pilot turns on the NLS drive and makes your screen shake, you'll come up on a small warehouse full of enemies and a semi-open area that lets you look into space. From here, drop down at the end of the hallway and find the first Equilibrium collectible on the ground, below the entrance. Second collectible: After the second encounter, in the hangar Use the cranes to get there if you don't have an Eager Edge sword. Screenshot by Destructoid After taking down Harrow, Dredgen Apprentice, you'll crawl out of a duct into an open hangar with ships in the distance and a few enemies near you, including a Behemoth. Don't follow the correct path on the right, which leads you upward and into an open tube. Instead, go to the ships on the left side of the room, where the snipers are. There's a small crate behind the second ship, and you'll find the collectible inside it. Third collectible: Below the tank after the second encounter This marks the last one. Screenshot by Destructoid Continue and you'll find an area with two Behemoths and an inactive tank. Jump below the tank as usual and take the first duct on your right to find the last Equilibrium collectible on the ground, in a short hallway blocked by some junk. The item itself may be difficult to see, but the Interact prompt gives it away more easily. Once you've found all three collectibles, don't forget to claim the Listen In triumph, which grants a boost to Heirloom's drop rate. It doesn't do anything for your odds of getting the Dark Crystal for your Praxic Blade , however. Outside of the award, you also get the Praxic Drape shader , used in the dungeon's base armor. The brown has a slight leathery texture that shows up when using it in other gear, and one of the beige tones also brings a cloth texture. It may not go well with every armor piece, especially some of the bulkier ones. But hey, there's no such thing as too many shaders.

2025-12-16T14:43:07,How to identify an Obambo in Phasmophobia,"Phasmophobia has all kinds of unique ghost types you can identify, and over the years, this list of ghosts has grown a few times. On Dec. 12, 2025, the Obambo joined the roster, making it one of the later game additions and thus a tougher one to identify. Since this ghost wasn't around from the start like most others, there's a good chance you might need some help learning how to distinguish it from the rest. Luckily, this ghost has plenty of unique features you can watch out for. Here's how to identify an Obambo in Phasmophobia . Table of contents Obambo evidence in Phasmophobia Obambo behavior, patterns, and clues in Phasmophobia Obambo evidence in Phasmophobia Screenshot by Destructoid The Obambo has three official pieces of evidence you need to watch out for, which are Ghost Writing, Ultraviolet, and the DOTS Projector. No other ghost has these three types of evidence, so anytime you catch them all, you know for sure you're dealing with an Obambo. Here's how to capture all three. Evidence How to get Ghost Writing Place a Ghost Writing Book down in the ghost room. If the ghost writes anything in the book , you can mark down Ghost Writing as evidence. In lower-level difficulties, you can definitely rule out this evidence if the ghost throws the book. In higher-level difficulties, you cannot rule it out, as it might be hiding this piece of evidence, and thus can still throw the book, even if it does technically have writing as evidence. Ultraviolet Use an Ultraviolet light to look for marks around the map, especially in or around the ghost room. You're looking for fingerprints, handprints, and footprints. The best way to check for this evidence is to place Salt around the host room and wait for the ghost to step in it. When they do, they'll leave behind Ultraviolet footprints if this is one of their evidence types. If you're on a higher difficulty level, the ghost may hide this evidence. DOTS Projector Place a DOTS Projector down in the ghost room and witness the ghost manifest in DOTS form in it. The DOTS form is essentially a ghostly silhouette that moves through the DOTS. You can also place a Video Camera down pointing at it to watch for DOTS from the safety of the truck. Obambo behavior, patterns, and clues in Phasmophobia Screenshot by Destructoid In addition to official evidence, all ghosts have their own unique behaviors, patterns, and other such clues you can watch out for. Here's everything we know about the Obambo so far, which will be updated as we continue to encounter this ghost. The Obambo has two different states , alternating between them frequently during investigations. Depending on the Obambo's mood, their behavior looks very different. While the Obambo is feeling aggressive , they're much quicker to start hunting. When the Obambo is feeling calm , they're much slower, easier to track, and less likely to hunt. Because it alternates between two vastly different states, it can be easy to mistake the Obambo for another ghost type. You might mistake it for The Twins due to its dual nature, a Demon based on its overly aggressive form, or a Shade because of its calm, relaxed state. Careful investigation is crucial for getting this one right. The Obambo is very noticeably different from all of these ghosts, making it easy to distinguish once you know what to look for. You can also use official evidence to confirm. The Obambo is very fickle , frequently switching up, and oftentimes defensive . May be an early hunter , or at the very least seems to hunt early under certain conditions. It seems like it may only be when the aggressive state is active, but we're still testing to figure out exactly how this works. While you're working to see if an Obambo might be haunting the map you're on, you also might want to tackle some key tasks like capturing unique evidence , unlocking hidden achievements , and completing Farmhouse Fieldwork .

2025-10-12T10:14:36,EA FC 26 İnceleme: Bu Sahalar Biraz Fazla Tanıdık…,"Her sene olduğu gibi bu sene de EA FC ile tekrardan buluştuk. Uzun bir süre oynadık ve sizler için detaylarıyla birlikte inceledik. Olumlu, olumsuz tüm yönlerini detaylarıyla birlikte sizlere aktardık. Gelin lafı daha da uzatmadan EA FC 26 incelememize başlayalım. EA FC 26 ne sunuyor? EA FC serisi, her yıl üzerine koyarak kendini devam ettirmeye çalışıyor. Tabii, bu konuda bazı dönemler başarılı olamayabiliyor. Bu yapımla birlikte, oyuna kayda değer bazı yenilikler geldiğini söyleyerek başlayabiliriz. Özellikle oynanış tarafında, oyunculara farklı modlar sunulmaya çalışılmış ve dinamiklerde bazı değişikliklere gidilmiş. Buna ek olarak kariyer kısımlarında da irili ufaklı değişiklikler de meydana gelmiş. Oynanıştaki değişiklikler EA FC 25 ile birlikte oynanış sisteminde bazı değişiklikler yaşanmıştı. Oyun, bizlere iki farklı temel oynanış sistemi sunuyordu. Bunlardan birisi rekabet, diğeri ise gerçekçilik odaklıydı. Her ne kadar çok kapsamlı olmasa da oyunculara bir seçenek sunulması güzel bir detaydı. FC 26 ile birlikte de bu durum daha gelişmiş bir şekilde karşımıza çıkıyor. Artık oyunu oynarken birbirinden farklı iki mod arasında seçim hakkı sunuluyor. Bunlardan biri “Authentic Gameplay” olarak adlandırılan ve oyunculara gerçekçi bir deneyim yaşatmayı hedefleyen oyun modu. Bu modla birlikte oyuncuların hızları, tepkileri, topun hızı ve diğer tüm detaylar gerçek bir futbol maçının hızına ve ağırlığına yakın olacak şekilde ayarlanıyor. Yani oyun daha yavaş fakat gerçekçilik daha yüksek oluyor diyebiliriz. Tabii, bu durum sadece tek kişilik veya arkadaş grupları ile oynanan çoklu oyunlarda geçerli. Ultimate Team tarafında ise tek bir oynanış modu seçeneğimiz bulunuyor. “Competitive Gameplay” olarak adlandırılan bu sistemde, çoğu oyunda bildiğimiz ve kullandığımız sistemin benzeri bulunuyor. Oyuncular ve oyun daha hızlı akıyor, rekabet daha çekişmeli geçiyor. Oyuncular, yaşamak istedikleri oyun deneyimlerine göre bu iki seçenekten birini seçerek ilerleyebiliyor. Oyunun bu konuda oyuncuları düşünmesi ve seçenek sunması artı yazmış diyebiliriz. Temel oynanış mekanikleri ne alemde? EA FC 26’nın bizlere sunduğu oyun modlarının yanı sıra temel mekaniklerde de bazı değişiklikler yaşanmış. Bunların başında kaleciler geliyor diyebilirim. EA FC 25’te uzaktan çok fazla gol atıyordum. Aynı şekilde vurduğum plaselerin çoğu da gol olmayı başarıyordu. FC 26 ile birlikte bu durum biraz değişmiş. Artık kaleciler kolay kolay uzaktan şut yemiyor. Aynı şekilde plaseleriniz de eskisi kadar rahat kaleyi bulmuyor. Bir önceki oyunda “Zaten nerden vurursam vurayım giriyor.” mantığının bu oyunda ortadan kalkması ve artık daha temkinli yaklaşma gereği duymamız oyun deneyimini keyiflendiren bir unsur olmuş. Tabii, online taraftaki oyunlar için bu durum farklı olabilir. Oradaki dinamikler, oyuncu farkları ve kaliteleri arasında büyük farklar olabildiği için gol sayıları da oldukça değişken olabiliyor. Pas ve şut sistemlerinde düzenlemeler yapılmış. EA FC 25 ile birlikte pas oyunu oynamak zor bir hale gelmişti. Gerek isabetlilik gerekse hissiyat açısından zayıf gelmişti. Bu yapımla birlikte bu durum da azalmış diyebilirim. Artık pas oyunu kurmak daha keyifli hale gelmiş. Paslar daha oturaklı ve gerçekçi hissettirmeyi başarıyor. Şut sistemi de aynı şekilde bir önceki yapıma göre üstüne koymuş. Aynı şekilde bir önceki yapımda karşımıza çıkan absürt goller de bu yapımla birlikte rafa kalkmış diyebilirim. Gol atmak artık daha zor ve uzaktan vurduğunuz her şut kaleye girmiyor. EA FC 26, pas ve şut mekaniklerinde oyuncuları tatmin etmeyi başarabilecek düzenlemelere imza atmış. Geçtiğimiz yıllarda eklenen “Zamanlı Bitiricilik” olayı da bu yapımla birlikte kaldırılmış. Geliştiriciler, büyük ihtimalle bu özelliğin çok az bir kesim tarafından kullanıldığını fark etti ve bu özelliği kaldırmış. Bunun yerine daha önceki oyunlarda da bulunan yerden şut mantığını getirmiş. Zamanlı bitiricilik özelliğini neredeyse hiç kullanmayan bir oyuncu olarak, eski sistemi birkaç kez kullandım. Devasa bir fark yaratmıyor fakat sizlere sunduğu çeşitlilik ve zor durumlarda aniden gol çıkartabilmenize imkân vermesi keyif seviyesini artıran unsurlardan olmuş. Oyundaki temel mekaniklerden birisi olan defans sistemi de bu oyunda daha kompleks bir hale gelmiş. Zaten EA FC ismine geçiş yapıldığından bu yana her yeni oyunda defans sistemi daha karmaşık ve zor bir hal alıyordu. Bu oyunda da bu gelenek bozulmamış. Defans yapmak, artık birkaç tuşa basıp bırakmaktan ibaret değil. Adam adama, alan savunması, ileride baskı ve defans çizgisi gibi alanlarda ciddi manada özveri harcamanız gerekiyor. Bu kısımda yapacağınız en ufak hata bile rakibin kaleci ile karşı karşıya kalmasına neden olabiliyor. EA FC serisindeki defans sitemi genel olarak sizi zorluyorsa, bu yapımda da bu durumun devam edeceğini söyleyebilirim. Zorluklar arasındaki dengesizlik Oyunda yer alan zorluklar arasındaki dengeler, geçen sene olduğu gibi pek iyi sağlanamamış. “Profesyonel” zorluktan “Dünya Klası” zorluğuna geçmek, aynı şekilde “Dünya Klası” zorluğundan “Efsanevi” zorluğuna geçmek, rakip yapay zekada ciddi farklara sebep oluyor. Bu aradaki dengenin daha stabil ayarlanması sağlanabilirmiş. Bunun dışında yapay zekâ genel olarak iyi çalışıyor. Özellikle yapay zekâ zorluğunu yükseltmek, rakip oyuncuların reflekslerini ve sahaya yerleşimlerini ciddi anlamda etkiliyor. Tabii, bu durumun kendi takımınız için geçerli olduğunu söyleyemem. Hem kontrolün sizde olması hem de kurduğunuz oyun sistemi, takımınızın yapay zekâ performansını ciddi oranda etkiliyor. Kariyer modu ve yenilikleri Benim gibi birçok oyuncu, bu oyunu kariyer modu odaklı oynayabiliyor. Online tarafa çok bulaşmadan kariyer yaparak keyif almaya çalışıyor. Peki EA FC 26 bu keyfi oyunculara iyi bir şekilde sunmayı başarabiliyor mu? Bu soruya cevabım çok net olmasa da “Evet” diyebilirim. Kariyer modunda bu oyunla birlikte bazı değişiklikler yaşanmış. Bu değişiklikler, kariyerin doğasını çok daha iyi bir hale getirmiş. Örneğin artık futbolcular kendi aralarında olay çıkartabiliyorlar. Ya da size gelip “Benim maaşım neden diğerlerinden az? Böyle devam ederse oynamak istemiyorum.” gibi sitemlerde bulunabiliyorlar. Aynı şekilde gerçek hayatta olduğu gibi hastalanabiliyor, uzun süreli sakatlıklar yaşayabiliyor ve hatta bazı sakatlıklar oyuncuların kariyerini dahi sonlandırabiliyor. Bu tarz yenilikler, kariyer modunu oynayan oyuncular için devasa olmasa da iyi sayılabilecek bir yenilik sunuyor. Tabii, bunun dışında kalan kısımların genellikle aynı olduğunu söyleyebilirim. EA FC 25’te nasıl bir kariyer deneyimi yaşıyorsanız, burada da aynı şekilde bu durum devam ediyor. Çok büyük beklentilere girmemekte fayda var. Teknik direktör kariyeri için gelen bir mod daha bulunuyor. Oyun içerisinde “Canlı” olarak adlandırılan bu mod, özünde bir challenge modu gibi çalışıyor. Oyun sizlere bir zaman aralığı veriyor ve bu zaman aralığı arasında istenilen hedefleri tamamlamanızı istiyor. İşin kritik tarafı ise bu modun sadece zaman öldürmekten başka bir işe yaramaması. Yani bu modda girip bir challenge tamamlamak sizlere çok da büyük bir avantaj sağlamıyor. Bazı Ultimate Team ödülleri dışında bir avantajı yok. Bu da bu moda olan motivasyonu ciddi oranda azaltarak oyuncuyu kendinden uzaklaştırabiliyor. Yine de “Girip biraz zaman öldüreyim.” diyenler için denenebilir bir mod olmuş. Oyuncu kariyeri ise bildiğimiz mantıkla devam ediyor. Bu tarafta herhangi bir yenilik beklememekte fayda var. Geçtiğimiz yıllardan bildiğimiz, tanıdığımız oyuncu kariyeri modu hala devam ediyor. Ufak birkaç değişiklik olsa da bunları fark etmek için dikkatinizi vermeniz gerekiyor. Ultimate Team ve diğer online özellikler Öncelikle akıl sağlığımı korumak açısından bu oyunun online tarafına çok girmediğimi söyleyerek başlamak istiyorum. Her ne kadar bundan 3-4 yıl önce dereceye girecek kadar çok vakit geçiriyor olsam da artık online tarafta yer almıyorum. Yine de girip özelliklere bir göz attım tabii. Bu alanda herhangi bir değişiklik var mı derseniz de çok olmasa da mevcut olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Bu yenilikler de genel olarak oynanış tarafında değil. Daha çok Ultimate Team görevleri, kart alma, kadro kurma sistemlerinde ufak değişikliklere gidilmiş. Bunun dışında, oynanış olarak bir önceki oyun ile benzer bir deneyim vadediyor. Clubs modunda ise çoğu oyuncunun ısrarla dile getirdiği birden fazla takımda yer alabilme özelliği bu yapımla birlikte gelmiş. Yani farklı takımlarla maç yapabilmek için mevcut takımınızdan ayrılmanıza gerek kalmıyor. Aynı anda 3 takımda birden forma giyebiliyorsunuz. Güzel ve kullanıcı dostu bir yenilik olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Tabii, bu özellik çok daha önceden de getirilebilirdi. EA FC 26 ile gelen Türkçe spiker Belki de bizim için bu yılın en büyük yeniliği, yeni eklenen Türkçe spiker desteği oldu. Artık EA FC serisinde resmî bir şekilde Türkçe spiker bulunuyor. Maçın anlatımını tecrübeli spiker Özkan Öztürk yaparken, yorumcu koltuğunda da hepimizin eğlenceli mizacı ile tanıdığı Ertem Şener yer alıyor. İnternette her ne kadar ortam ikiye bölünse de ben spiker performansının başarılı olduğunu düşünenlerdenim. İngilizce spikerlerin tepkileri ve yorum stili ile benzer bir ton yakalanmış. Tabii, buradaki fark bizim bu alana girişimizin çok yeni olması. Oyuncular tarafından kıyaslanan İngilizce spiker, neredeyse oyunun piyasa sürülmesinden bu yana devam ediyor ve üzerine koyarak gelişiyor. Türkçe spiker de her yeni oyunda daha da gelişecek ve ideal deneyime yaklaşacaktır. Şu anlık bu spiker kalitesinin ve anlatımının iyi bir düzeyde olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Arayüz tasarımı FIFA isminin bırakılması ve EA FC ismine geçiş yapılması ile birlikte değişen en kritik detaylardan birisi de oyunun arayüzü olmuştu. Ben, yeni arayüzün oldukça basit ve estetikten uzak olduğunu düşünen taraftaydım. Buna ek olarak oldukça yavaş kalıyordu. EA FC 26 ile birlikte arayüz her ne kadar aynı olsa da biraz daha hızlı çalıştığını söyleyebilirim. Menüler arasında geçiş, tuş tepkimeleri vs. Daha oturaklı ve hızlı bir hale gelmiş. Tabii, bu unsurların daha iyi hale gelmesi arayüzü iyi bir konuma getirmiyor. Hala daha iyi bir arayüz tasarımı oluşturulabileceğini düşünenlerdenim. Grafikler ve teknik detay EA FC 26, görsel olarak da bu yıl tatmin edici bir şekilde karşımıza çıkmış. Bir önceki oyuna göre devasa yenilikler var mı? Hayır. Peki gelişmiş mi? Evet. Her yeni oyunla birlikte görsel tarafta da geliştirmeler doğal olarak oluyor. Bu farklar her ne kadar devasa olmasa da teknolojinin gelişim hızına göre ideal bir gelişim var diyebiliriz. Yansımalar, ışıklandırmalar ve oyuncu animasyonları bir önceki oyuna göre daha iyi hale gelmiş. Oyuncu animasyonları, stadyum ve taraftar detayları da aynı şekilde bir önceki yapıma göre daha iyi bir seviyeye ulaşmış. Biz oyunu PlayStation 5 üzerinden deneyimledik. Bu deneyim sırasında da birkaç çökme dışında herhangi bir olumsuz deneyimle karşılaşmadık. Bu durum her ne kadar PlayStation 5 tarafında stabil olsa da PC tarafında birçok şikâyet bulunuyor. Bu şikayetlerin başında oyunun FPS problemleri ve sürekli çökmesi gibi detaylar var. EA FC oyunlarının konsol odaklı bir geliştirme süreci olması nedeniyle PC tarafında optimizasyon problemleri sıklıkla yaşanıyor. Eğer oyunu PC için alacaksanız, bu durumu dikkate almanızda fayda var. EA FC 26 İnceleme: Son sözler EA FC 26, bir önceki oyun ile devasa farklara sahip değil. İrili ufaklı bazı değişiklikler yapılmış ve güncel kadrolarla yeniden bizlere sunulmuş. Oynanış kısmında yapılan bazı değişiklikler oyunu daha keyifli bir hale getirmiş olsa da daha iyisi yapılabilirmiş dedim. Online tarafta ise ne yazık ki kayda değer pek bir yenilik bulunmuyor. Yine de bir futbol oyunu oynamak istiyorsanız, son yıllarda karşımıza çıkmış en rafine “EA FC” deneyimini sunduğunu söyleyebilirim. Özellikle Türkçe spikerin eklenmiş olması, biz Türk oyuncular için büyük bir nimet. Peki bu oyun tam fiyattan alınır mı? Hastası değilseniz indirim beklemenizi öneririm. Olumlu Pas ve şut sistemleri daha oturaklı ve gerçekçi olmuş. Kariyer modundaki spontane gelişen olaylar farklı bir tat katmış. Türkçe spiker Oyuncuya sunulmuş iki farklı oynanış tarzı Olumsuz Oyuncu kariyeri, Ultimate Team gibi alanlarda neredeyse yenilik yok diyebiliriz. PC tarafındaki teknik problemler bazı oyuncuların oyunu oynamasına engel oluyor. Zorluk dengesizlikleri ve savunma sisteminin gün geçtikçe zor bir hale gelmesi. Özgünlükten uzak ve yavaş arayüz.

Daha önce Barista Simulator ve BBQ Simulator oyunlarını geliştiren Compact Core Games, yayıncılığını GameDev.ist’in üstlendiği M edieval Crafter: Blacksmith ile oyuncuları bir cüce demirci olmaya davet ediyor. 22 Eylül’de Steam’de yerini alacak olan oyunda hem günlük araç gereçler dövüyor hem de kudretli silahları can veriyoruz. Silah atölyemizde dövdüğümüz silah ve zırhları görev temelli bir oynanış döngüsüyle satmak da mümkün. Oyunun en ilginç yanlarından biri ise üretim simülasyonunu, bağımlılık yapıcı bir yönetim döngüsüyle birleştirmesinde yatıyor. Oyunda dövdüğümüz güçlü silahları doğrudan satmak yerine kahramanlarla anlaşıp, onları giydirebiliyoruz. Ekipmanlarımızla bizzat kuşattığımız kahramanları daha sonra görevlere gönderiyor ve bu görevlerden ganimet, yeni silah şemaları ve kıymetli malzemeler elde ediyoruz. Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith bu yönüyle hem zanaat simülasyonu hem de yönetim elementlerini sevenler için ideal. Çıkışına saatler kala 32.000 istek listesine ulaşan yapım, Türkiye’ye özel fiyat etiketiyle çıkış yapacak. Üstelik %20’lik çıkış indirimiyle çok daha cazip bir fiyat etiketine dönüşüyor. Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith 30.000 İstek Listesinde! Erken Erişim etiketiyle çıkan yapım ilerleyen süreçte atölyeyi düzenleme ve genişletme gibi yeni güncellemelerle buluşacak. Otomasyon elementini de oyuna kazandırmak isteyen geliştirici ekip, ham maddeleri toplamak için atölyemizde işçi çalıştırmamızı sağlayarak, farklı formüller ile oynanışı derinleştirmeyi hedefliyor. Birçok Erken Erişim oyununda olduğu gibi Compact Core Games de bu süreçte oyuncuların geri bildirimlerine de ihtiyaç duyacak. Eğer Medieval Crafter: Blacksmith’i geliştiricilerle birlikte tam sürüme taşımak isterseniz, oyunun Discord sunucusuna katılabilirsiniz.

2025-05-10T10:26:02,MotoGP 25 İnceleme Dosyası: Erişilebilir Motorculuk,"MotoGP serisinin en yeni üyesi MotoGP 25, devasa yapımlarının birbirlerini gölgede bırakmak için yarıştığı bir haftada çıkmış olabilir. Ancak bazı yönleriyle serinin kıdemlilerinden çok acemilerine hitap ediyor. Buna rağmen dikey öğrenme eğrisiyle oyuncusunu zorlayan MotoGP 25, yeni modları ve Unreal Engine 5 ile yenilenen görselliğiyle serinin hayranlarını da memnun edebilir. MotoGP 25 inceleme dosyamızda serinin yeni üyesinin önceki yıla kıyasla neler sunduğuna, serinin hem severlerine hem de yeni tanışanlarına neler vadettiğine bir bakalım. MotoGP 25 İnceleme – Oyun Modları MotoGP 25’in serinin önceki oyunlarından sonra devrimsel mekanikler getirdiğini söylemek mümkün değil. Her ne kadar önceki oyunlarda piste çıkmamış olsam da Milestone’un seriye vites attırdığını söyleyemem. Fakat yine de Grand Prix yarışlarının arasında nefes alırken oynayabileceğiniz, oldukça keyifli üç farklı mod, MotoGP 25’in serinin hayranlarını da memnun edecek derinliğe götürüyor. Minibikes, Motard ve Flat Track modlarında aslında farklı sürüş disiplinlerinde kendimizi test ediyoruz. Örneğin Minibikes modunda daha küçük yarış motorlarında yarışıyoruz. Manevralara daha sert tepkiler veren bu motorlar, kariyer modunda alıştığımı GP motorlarından sonra çok farklı hissettirdi. F1 24 İnceleme Dosyası: Yılın En Tartışmalı Yarış Oyunu Motard ve Flat Track ise Minibikes’a göre daha zorlayıcı yapıdalar. Örneğin Motard modunda yine farklı motorlarla asfalt zeminde yarışırken, Flat Track’teki ilk yarışımda duvara çarpmış gibi hissettim. Eski Need for Speed oyunlarındaki gibi gaz verip, keserek öne geçtiğiniz bir yapıyı benimseyen Flat Track’te yolda kalmak çok zor. Ama oyun bunun üstesinden gelme konusunda oldukça motive edici. Dolayısıyla MotoGP 25 oyun modlarıyla da benden geçer not aldı. Kariyer Modu Nasıl Olmuş? Oyunun kariyer modu ise MotoGP 24’teki kariyer modunun üzerine küçük fakat etkili bazı değişiklikler getirmiş. Geliştirici Milestone tüm modu elden geçirmek yerine, yarışçılarla birebir kapıştığımız bazı meydan okumalarla kariyer modunu zenginleştirmiş. Hem meydan okumalarda hem de kariyer modunun doğal akışında sıklıkla yaptığım şey ise motoru test etmek oldu. Ancak ekiplerin bir test sınırı var ve test yaparken üreticilerin aldığı notları gözden geçirmek ve parçaların ne kadar yükseltilebileceğine dikkat etmek gerekiyor. Aslında birçok araç simülasyon oyununda gördüğüm ve çok sevdiğim bir karar süreci var. Her şeyi mikro düzeyde geliştirmeye çalışmak ve en küçük ayarlamaların bile pistte etkisini görmek için uğraşmak keyifli. Bir de bunun üzerine oynanış kabiliyetimin vakit geçtikçe artmasıyla MotoGP 25 benim için çok keyifli bir oyuna dönüştü. Fakat öğrenme hiçbir zaman belli bir doğruda gitmez. MotoGP’nin en yeni halkasında da bariyerlere çarpmak mümkün. Oyun her ne kadar tüm yönleriyle çok daha erişilebilir bir hale gelse de karmaşık gaz hareketlerinin üstesinden gelmek hala biraz zorlayıcı. Burada da devreye mühendis bileşeni giriyor. MotoGP 25’te mühendisinizle konuşup zorluk yaşadığınız noktalarda rehberlik ederek gelişmenizi sağlayan ipuçları sağlıyor. Serinin Hayranları Belki De Es Geçmeli… Serinin önceki oyunlarında onlarca saat asfalt ağlatan kıdemlilerin MotoGP 25 hakkında bolca şikayet edeceği noktalar olacak diye düşünüyorum. Ben 30 saati aşkın oynanış süremde ne kadar keyif alsam da, MotoGP 24’ün başarılı adımlarının kaybolan izlerini birçok kez hissettim. Fren ve yol tutuş mekaniklerindeki pişmemişlik ve keskin oynanış eğrisi sanal motorculuk kariyerimdeki en problemli noktalar oldu. Küçük bir dönüşte yaptığım hata bile oyunun acımasız fizik mekanikleri tarafından kurban edilmeme yol açtı. Bunun başta benden kaynaklı olduğunu düşünsem de küçük bir araştırmadan sonra geliştirici Milestone’un yapay zekanın farklı bir fizik modelinde oynadığını öğrendim. Fakat ilk 5-6 saatteki bu adaletsizlik, oyunu öğrenmeye çalışma isteğim ve en basit haliyle motor sürmenin verdiği keyifle yerini kabullenmeye bıraktı. 10.saatten sonra oyunun farklı modlarında keyif alıyor, bir sonraki virajda rakiplerimi nasıl yeneceğimi planlayıp gaz ve fren oyunları yapıyordum. Serinin kıdemli oyuncuları arasındaki büyük bir kitle MotoGP 25’in seleflerine göre farklı yönlerde geriye gittiğini söylemiş. Oyunun özellikle Steam üzerinde aldığı incelemeler, serinin Unreal Engine 5’e geçmesine rağmen teknik, oynanış ve de görsel açıdan vites düşürdüğünü bile belirtmiş. Buradaki en sık okuduğum eleştirilerden biri oyunun halihazırda bir Arcade modu olmasına rağmen Pro modunu da kolaylaştırmaları hakkında. Geliştirici Milestone, oyuncu tabiriyle “çok kasmadan” oynamak isteyenler için bir mod sunarken, profesyonel modda gerçekçi fizik mekaniklerinin işlediği bir deneyim vadediyor. Ancak o deneyimi bile basitleştirmek kıdemlilerin MotoGP 24’ü konsollarından ya da bilgisayarlarından kaldırmadan önce bir daha düşünmelerini sağlayabilir. Seriyle Tanışanlar İçin İdeal Ancak önceki MotoGP oyunlarını hiç oynamamış biri olarak, beni mekanikleri alıştırma sürecindeki bazı zorluklar ve dikey öğrenme eğrisine rağmen MotoGP 25, ne oynayayım diye oyun ararken “dur biraz yarışayım ya” dedirtmeyi başardı. Bence, günün sonunda bir simülasyon oyunu ya da profesyonel yarış oyunu ne kadar derinlik vadederse vadetsin ulaşması gereken noktada budur. Tekrar oynama aralıkları kısa ve oynanış süreleri uzunsa bir oyuna bağlanmışsınız demektir. MotoGP 25, Unreal Engine 5’ten kaynaklı olduğunu düşündüğüm bazı takılmalarına rağmen seriye giriş yapmak isteyenlere önereceğim bir oyun olacak. MotoGP 25 İnceleme – Son Söz Sonuç olarak MotoGP 25 her ne kadar seleflerinin izinden radikal adımlarla ayrılmasa da dikey öğrenme eğrisinin sonunda sunduğu modları ve ödüllendirici deneyimiyle seri acemilerini mutlu edecektir. Unreal Engine 5 görselliği sayesinde hem seriye yeni adım atanları hem de kolaylaştırılmış yapısını sineye çekebilecek seri kıdemlilerini “bir tur daha” demeye zorlayacak kadar çekici. Zorlukları ne kadar konuşulsa da, her virajda biraz daha ustalaşma tatmini arayanlar için MotoGP 25, engelleriyle dahi keyif veren bir başlangıç noktası olmuş.

2025-03-20T12:43:46,inZOI Ön İnceleme: Sims’in Tahtına Aday mı?,"Hayallerimizdeki hayatları yaşadığımız, en azından karakterlerimize yaşatmaya çalıştığımız yaşam simülasyonlarının şimdilik son ve en iddialı görünen temsilcisi inZOI oyunculara erken erişim sürecinde neler vadediyor gelin ön inceleme ile bir bakış atalım. Yıllardır kayda değer en önemli temsilcisinin The Sims serisi olduğu yaşam simülasyonu türü haliyle pek çok oyuncunun kafasında bu seri ile özdeş. Ancak inZOI Studio tarafından geliştirilen ve yayıncı koltuğunda Krafton’un oturduğu inZOI arkasına büyük bir beklenti rüzgarı alarak karşımıza çıkmaya hazırlanıyor. Oyunu erken erişim sürecinde deneyimleme fırsatı bulmuş ve kendini bildi bileli yaşam simülasyonları (tamam itiraf ediyorum, çoğunlukla The Sims serisi) ile haşır neşir ben sevgili editörünüze de inZOI ön inceleme yazısı kaleme almak düştü. Karakter Yaratma Ekranı ile Başlayalım Unreal Engine 5’in gücünü arkasına alan inZOI etkileyici ve detay seviyesi ile şaşırtan gerçekçi grafikler ile karşımıza çıkıyor. Haliyle bu detaycılık seviyesi ve gerçekçilik karakterlerimizde de kendini gösteriyor. ZOI’lerimizi yaratırken yüzündeki küçücük bir benden tırnaklarının uzunluğuna, göz bebeklerinin şeklinden (evet şeklinden) makyajının en ine ayrıntısına kadar pek çok farklı detaya müdahale edebiliyoruz. Bunun yanında eksikler yok mu, elbette var. Karakter yaratma ekranında en çok dikkatimi çeken eksik kıyafet seçeneklerinin azlığı oldu ancak bunu hem erken erişime, hem de kıyafetler üzerinde dilediğimiz gibi oynamalar yapabilme özgürlüğümüze bağlıyorum. Oyunun hazır sunduğu kıyafetler pek çeşitli olmasa da biraz vakit ayırarak ZOI’nizi bir k-pop yıldızı veya moda ikonu gibi giydirmeniz mümkün. Seçtiğiniz kıyafetin yakasından koluna kadar her şeyi değiştirerek bambaşka bir parça ortaya çıkartabilirsiniz. Kısacası zevkinize uygun bir kıyafet bulamadıysanız ona en yakın giysiyi bulduktan sonra üzerinde kendi değişikliklerinizi yaparak karakterinize “haute couture” bir tasarım giydirebilirsiniz. Karakter yaratma ekranının sunduğu şeyler karakterimizin dış görünüşü ile de sınırlı değil. ZOI’lerimizin kişiliklerine, hayat amaçlarına ve tutkularına da yine bu ekrandan seçiyoruz. Oyun bize toplamda 18 kişilik tipi ve özelliği arasında seçim yapma imkanı sunuyor ve bu kişilik özellikleri karakterimizin davranışlarının bir nevi temelini oluşturuyor. Örneğin girimci karakterler stresle öteki kişilik tiplerindeki karakterlerden daha çok katlanabiliyorlar. Bu karakter özellikleri oyun boyunca ZOI’ler arasındaki iletişimi de etkiliyor. Örnek vermek gerekirse tam da bekleneceği üzere otoriter ZOI’ler ve özgür ruhlu karakterler pek de anlaşamıyorlar. Karakteri Yarattık, Sıra Başımızı Sokacak Bir Yer Bulmakta InZOI karakter yaratma ekranındaki çeşitliliği inşa konusunda da sürdürüyor. Yıllarca The Sims’in her bir oyunu başında ayrı ayrı dirsek çürütmüş biri olarak başlangıçta inZOI’nin inşa sistemine alışmak ne yalan söyleyeyim beni biraz zorladı ancak bir kez alıştıktan sonra da devamı çok kolay geldi. Oyun erken erişimde karakterimizi sokaklarına dilediğimizce atabileceğimiz ve birbirinden farklı temalara sahip 3 şehir ile karşılıyor. Benim tercihim şehir yaşantısından yana oldu ancak siz dilerseniz karakterinizi sakin bir sahil kasabasında keyif çatmaya da yollayabilirsiniz. İnşa kısmına geri dönecek olursak inZOI eşyalar konusunda da özelleştirme noktasının üzerine epeyce eğilmemizi sağlıyor. Pek çok farklı eşya arasından dilediğinizi seçtikten sonra bunları dilediğiniz gibi kişiselleştirmeniz mümkün. Örneğin bir yatakta karar kıldıktan sonra malzeme türünden rengine, yatak örtüsünün kumaşından bu kumaşın dokumasına kadar neredeyse her detaya kendi dokunuşunuzu katabiliyorsunuz. Ha derseniz ki “benim o kadar vaktim de sabrım da yok” öyleyse sizi oyunun sunduğu hazır evlere doğru alalım. Şahsen ben öyle yaptım. InZOI’nin en dikkat çekici yanlarından  bir tanesi de oyuna istediğiniz nesneyi ekleyebiliyor oluşunuz. 3D printer sayesinde yüklediğiniz bir fotoğrafı oyun içerisine 3 boyutlu model olarak aktarıp kullanabiliyorsunuz. Buna farklı kıyafet ve aksesuarlardan tutun eş eşyalarına veya süslemelere kadar pek çok şey dahil. InZOI’yi diğer rakiplerinin önüne geçiren en büyük özelliklerden birisi bana kalırsa bu. Ayrıca şimdiden muzip oyuncuların yaratacakları “enteresan” tasarımları da merak etmiyor değilim. Bunun yanında geliştiricilerin de sık sık üzerinde durdukları konulardan biri hareketler ve mimiklerin de videodan oyuna aktarılabileceği ancak dürüst olmak gerekirse bunu denemedim ve nasıl bir performans gösterdiği konusunda fikrim yok. Peki ZOI’lerimizin Hayatları Nasıl Geçiyor? Karakteri yarattık, evimizi dayadık döşedik. Sıra geldi kendimizi sokaklara vurmaya. Geliştiriciler her ne kadar The Sims rakibi olmadıklarını söylemiş olsalar da oyuncular olarak pek çoğumuz oyunu pek çok ve haklı sebeple The Sims serisi ile kıyaslıyoruz. InZOI yıllardır alıştığımız The Sims serisine göre çok daha gerçekçi bir ortam sunuyor. Bu gerçekçilik yalnızca karakter görünüşleri veya grafikler ile alakalı da değil. Örneğin bir yerden bir yere gitmek istediğinizde şehrin sokakları arasına karışmak, toplu taşımayı kullanmak gerekiyor. Bunun yanında The Sims serisinin kendine has ve felaketler karşısında kimi zaman sarkastik kalan mizah anlayışı da inZOI’de yok. Her şey çok daha gerçekçi olmasına karşın oyunun derinlerinde bir yerlerde bazı şeylerin havada kaldığı hissinden bir türlü kurtulamadım. Önümde gerçekten yaşayan ve canlı gibi görünen bir dünya olsa da belki erken erişimin azizliğinden olsa gerek o gerçekçilik maskesinin zaman zaman parça parça döküldüğü pek çok yer oldu. Sokaklar dolu görünse de etkileşime girdiğiniz diğer karakterler şimdilik birer robottan farksız hissettiriyorlar. Örneğin diyaloglar. Farklı konularda sohbet etmeye çalıştığımda gerek diyalogların, gerekse de konuşmaların döngüye girdiğini hissettiğim pek çok an yaşadım. Tüm bunları bir kenara bırakıp standart bir ZOI’nin bir gününden bahsedelim. Karakterlerimiz bekleneceği çok çeşitli ihtiyaçlar ve sorumluluklara sahipler. Örneğin okula giden bir karakteriniz varsa ödevlerinizi yapmalı ve okulda aktif olmalısınız. InZOI bu noktada da The Sims serisinden ayrılıyor. Karakteriniz ofisteyken çalışma alanını dışarıdan izlemek zorunda kalmıyorsunuz ancak bu süreyi pek de aktif geçirebileceğiniz de söylenemez. Ofis çalışanı bir ZOI işe gittikten sonra günün önemli bir kısmını burada harcıyor, bize de bu süreyi ufak tefek şeylere müdahale edebilsek de çoğunlukla oturup zamanın geçmesini beklemek kalıyor. Ancak hakkını da yemeyelim, inZOI bazıları uçuk kaçık (örneğin bir k-pop idolü olabilirsiniz!) bazıları da ayakları son derece yere basan pek çok farklı kariyer yolu sunuyor. Bunlar arasından tam zamanlı veya yarı zamanlı olarak da seçim yapabilir, hatta isterseniz freelance de çalışarak hayatınızı idame ettirmeye çalışabilirsiniz. Gelelim Son Sözlere InZOI yaşam simülasyonlarına pek çok farklılık ve yepyeni harika detaylar eklese de erken erişim sürecinde olduğunu sıklıkla hissettiriyor. Oyunun hala pek çok eksiği ve zaman zaman kırıldığı yer olsa da bu sıkıntıların bazılarının tam sürüm ile birlikte çözüleceğini umuyorum. Oyun bu haliyle verdiği pek çok vaadi gerçekleştiriyor, burası net ancak tüm bunları adını koymanın zor olduğu ve hiç de doğal hissettirmeyen bir soğuklukla yapabiliyor. Yine de yanlış anlaşılmasın, inZOI kesinlikle tam potansiyeline ulaştığında başında zamanın nasıl akıp gittiği anlaşılmayan o oyunlardan biri olmaya aday.

2023-10-04T19:39:15,Why Is Sega Saturn So Hard To Emulate?,"Sega went all-out during the 5 th console generation to dethrone Nintendo and deal with the upcoming challenger called Sony. Compared to its 16-bit predecessor, Saturn delivers a massive leap in processor technology. However, this increased speed came at the expense of complexity which made the console quite hard to develop games for. Why is Sega Saturn so hard to emulate? It boils down to two primary factors, the first of which is the complicated multi-processor design that incorporates dual Hitachi SH-2 microprocessors along with six other coprocessors. Secondly, the Sega Saturn utilizes quadrilateral polygons instead of triangles to render 3D graphics . Despite its immense processing power and forward-looking design choices (CD-ROM drive), Sega’s 5 th gen console was a commercial failure. Sega kept its development under wraps and barely communicated with third-party developers who didn’t get enough time to train on this overly complicated system. As a result, Saturn didn’t have nearly enough launch titles to help it compete against the PS1 and Nintendo’s upcoming N64. Why Is Sega Saturn So Hard To Emulate? If you take a look at consoles from the 5 th generation (between the mid to late 1990s), none are as hard to emulate as the Sega Saturn. It’s quite puzzling how complex the emulation for this console is because much more powerful consoles from the 6 th gen (like PS2) are emulated relatively easily. Right now, if you’re using a PC you only have a couple of reliable emulators that will run a majority of Saturn games without performance issues. SSF, Yabause, and Mednafen are all fairly good at Saturn emulation. But there are still some games that generate glitches, crashes, etc. while running on these emulators. And given how powerful any modern PC is, one wonders why we are having so much trouble emulating a 32-bit console from the 1990s. The answer lies within Saturn’s plastic shell. Open it up, and you’ll find a motherboard that looks like a small city filled with electronic inhabitants and skyscrapers made out of silicon. There are a total of 8 microprocessors in the Sega Saturn, each responsible for handling various tasks from graphics to sound. Modern consoles integrate the CPU, GPU, and I/O management into a single package. Audio is also handled by this main processor. But back in the day, lithography processes weren’t advanced enough to integrate so many functions into a single chip. And it was cheaper to solder a bunch of existing chips onto a motherboard than create an all-in-one processor from scratch. Sega wanted a next-gen console fast, and they wanted to do it with existing technology. So they took two Hitachi SH-2 32-bit processors, a Motorola 68EC1000, a sound processor, and two video processors, and slapped it all onto a single board. Then, they added a Yamaha FH1 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to handle FM synthesis and pulse code modulation for Sega Saturn’s 32-channel audio. Even the CD-ROM drive has its own dedicated processor in the form of a Hitachi SH-1, to compress load times. Finally, you have a System Control Unit (SCU) chip to coordinate communications between all the buses (it also has an internal DSP). Imagine if you can, the nightmare of recreating all this lunacy inside a virtual environment. Which is what emulator developers have to do. And they must also conduct various tests/ optimizations to make sure that this emulator works across an infinite number of PC hardware configurations. What Is The Best Emulator For Sega Saturn? If you’re on PC, the best standalone emulators are SSF, Yabause, and Mednafen. I also recommend you give RetroArch a try. It’s not an emulator, but a general-purpose GUI frontend for all retro consoles/ arcades. Within RetroArch, you can download “cores” for various systems. The best Saturn core within RetroArch is Beetle. Alongside the core, you’ll also need a BIOS file. Is Sega Saturn Stronger Than PS1? There are areas where Sega’s Saturn trumps the PS1, and there are areas where the PS1 is stronger than the Saturn. When it comes to 2D graphics, the Sega Saturn was more than a match for PS1. Thanks to its dual Hitachi SH-2 processors clocked at 28.6MHz (PS1 has a single R3000 clocked at 33.8MHz), Saturn has more theoretical processing power than PS1. However, harnessing the full potential of Saturn was very hard because of its complexity. Saturn can also draw more pixels, and do it faster than PS1. That’s because PS1 relies on its polygon engine while Saturn draws pixels through hardware on the processors. PS1’s Geometry Transform Engine (GTE) was an excellent video processor for its time. But if Saturn’s VDP1 and VDP2 are used in coordination with the SH-2 processor and DSP, they could outperform PS1 in terms of geometry processing and polygon fill rate. In essence, Saturn has more potential power but it’s a lot harder to tap into unless you’re a genius developer who’s had sufficient time to train on the Sega Saturn. Is Sega Saturn A Bad Console? On the surface, it seems like a really good console with how much power it has. But once you start looking into the details, it becomes clear that Sega rushed this product to the market and was desperate not to fall behind Sony’s PS1. Originally, Saturn was supposed to have just one Hitachi SH-2 CPU. This processor was selected because it was cheap, readily available, and would speed up the production chain. Sega wanted to get their new console to the market fast before PS1 and N64 were released. And they just didn’t have the time to sit down and create a brand-new CPU design from scratch. However, the engineers soon realized that one SH-2 wasn’t enough to compute a realistic 3D world. So they added a second one. And just when Sega was applying the finishing touches to Saturn in late 1993, rumors of the PS1 and its 3D capabilities started to spread like wildfire. Sega’s executives were deeply concerned that Saturn’s 3D performance would fall behind PS1. So they decided to add a second video processor (VDP2). Now, the console has two main processors and two video processors. It was a last-minute job, and developers weren’t notified of hardware changes ahead of the release schedule. As a result, they didn’t get enough time to train on Saturn’s complicated design. When the console was finally released in 1994, it took a while for 3 rd parties to create decent games for it. Sega’s reputation had already taken a hit with the 32X and customers weren’t too happy with the slow rollout of games for Saturn. Why Was Sega Saturn A Flop? Yes, it was a commercial failure and caused Sega to lose tons of money. Money that it couldn’t afford to lose after the failure of 32X and the Sega CD. Because Sega was losing money, they couldn’t fund an expensive marketing campaign like in the Genesis days. However, Nintendo was doing just fine and could afford to spend a lot more money on marketing. By releasing quality games and not rushing unfinished products to the market, Nintendo earned the trust of gamers. Gradually, Sega started to fade away from the gaming scene. Saturn got very few games on launch day, and its library was quite underwhelming compared to PS1 and N64. Plus, it launched at $399 which was $100 more than PS1. Saturn sold just 9.2 million units to the PS1’s 102.4 million. How Much RAM Did The Sega Saturn Have? Saturn had 2MB of general-purpose RAM, 1.5MB of VRAM, and 512KB of RAM for audio. Nothing earth-shattering, but quite impressive given its release date of late 1994. Plus, this was enough to run early 3D games at a resolution of 320 x 224 (going all the way up to 704 x 224). Conclusion I hope this article helped you understand the complexity of Saturn’s design and why it’s still so hard to emulate this console properly. It’s not a matter of computational difficulty because modern systems are more than capable of pushing several hundred FPS in Saturn games. Rather, it’s a design issue. The people making Saturn emulators have to spend a lot of time testing and certifying the emulator for various games, across different PC configurations. Sega didn’t do game developers any favors by making such a complex console. And its complexity was one of the reasons behind Saturn’s demise.

2023-09-30T12:55:07,10 Best DOS Golf Games That Are Worth Checking,"What DOS golf games lack in graphical fidelity, they more than compensate for with realistic simulation of things such as terrain and wind. Some of these are more arcade-oriented than others, skirting the laws of physics in the interest of fun and spectacle. No matter which type of golf game you prefer, I’ve got quite a selection for you to choose from. Here are the 10 best DOS golf games that are worth checking out. Because these games are so old and from a relatively obscure subgenre, finding detailed information on them can be very hard. Fortunately, you can just go to an online DOS games website and give these a try in your browser to decide whether you like them or not. Links 386 Pro Back then, most DOS golf games of the simulation variety were made by just one developer- Access Software. Links 386 Pro is part of their Links series, which began in 1990 with “Links: The Challenge of Golf”. This is the sequel to that game and was released just 2 years later with a few extra features. If you purchased the CD version for your PC, you could enjoy audio commentary by Bobcat Goldthwait. He acted as your caddie, constantly making sarcastic quips and comedic interjections between plays.  The CD version also includes an aerial flyby shot of each hole, streamed in real-time from the disc. Mean 18 It’s not as simulation-focused as Links 386 Pro, but Mean 18 still features 3 famous courses. It has Augusta National, Pebble Beach, and St. Andrews. If you want, you can even create a custom course using the level editor. Controls are fairly simple; you execute a complete swing with just 3 mouse clicks. With the first click you initiate the swing, power is adjusted by clicking a second time, and the third click lets you decide between draw or fade. There are two difficulty modes- beginner, and expert. PGA Tour Golf Despite being one of the oldest golf games on my list, PGA Tour Golf looks and sounds excellent compared to its peers who had the advantage of using newer technology. The game has three courses- PGA West, TPC Avenel, and TPC Sawgrass. These are actual courses, but the developers also included a fictional course called Sterling Shores. Four game modes are available- Tournament, Driving, Putting, and Practice. What makes this game amazing is that you get a 3D view of each hole before the shot, after which the camera gradually pans over to your character’s location. Wind physics is a thing, and replays are automatically played for good shots (you even get audio tips from PGA golfers). World Class Leader Board Golf While it’s a golf game from the legendary developers at Access, few played it even back when it was new. It simply didn’t get as much attention as the much more well-known Links series of golf games from the same developer. Nevertheless, this is a very fun game and simulates complex details such as wind, terrain features, etc. You must try to dodge all the water holes, rough patches, and bunkers. There are three real courses in this game- St. Andrews, Cypress Creek, and Doral Country Club. There is a fictional fourth course, along with a level editor so you can craft your own course. Links: The Challenge of Golf The very first Access Software game in the Links series, it set the benchmark for several years to come in the simulation golfing genre. While the game has just one course- Torrey Pines South, it makes up for this fact with plenty of detail in every aspect. For instance, there’s an overhead map function that lets you see the whole course and place a contoured grid on top. It even has audio commentary that reacts based on the dynamic nature of your performance. You can watch replays for every single shot, both from where you hit the ball and from where it landed. And finally, this is one of the earliest golf games to have a multiplayer mode. Harvey’s Zany Golf A complete departure from the simulation-style golf games that we’ve been reviewing up until now, Zany Golf is an arcade-like recreation of miniature golf. Just like in real-life mini golf courses, you’ve got plenty of obstacles, banked turns, and drops. To shoot your ball, you click on it and pull back in the opposite direction, much like charging a slingshot. Once you’re satisfied with the power and angle, you let go. Sometimes, there will be fairies on the course that reward you bonus points for striking them. If you complete one hole fast, you can get more time for the next one. World Tour Golf Created by the same team that did Mail Order Monsters, World Tour Golf is inspired by Nintendo Golf (which the developers were playing after they finished Mail Order Monsters). This game is a hodgepodge of ideas and code. Its graphics are based on an internal EA bitmap editor, which would later become Deluxe Paint. While the game didn’t have a bunch of courses, you could create as many as you wanted with the level editor. Some of the more cartoonish fictional courses in this game are a callback to Racing Destruction Set, another EA game that had been released the year before. Sensible Golf With a name like that, you’d imagine this to be a simulation golf game. But it uses the same engine as Sensible Soccer and Cannon Fodder- two of the wackiest games from the early 1990s. Sensible Golf doesn’t look realistic, it has this cartoonish art design featuring stick-figure caricatures of humans. Controlling your shot’s power is so hard because you have to time it exactly right as a needle moves up and down along a gauge. Jack Niklaus’ Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf If you’re a golf fan, you’ve surely heard of Jack Niklaus who’s widely considered one of the greatest to ever grace the sport, with 117 professional wins. This game contains his favorite 18 holes in one custom-built course. Holes have been taken from Augusta National Golf Club, Muirfield, Pebble Beach Golf Links, and many other courses. PGA European Tour A simulation golf game released in 1994 by EA, based on- you guessed it, the PGA European Tour. PGA European Tour is an interactive glossary/ brochure containing information on significant courses and clubs, with a pretty solid golf game bolted on top of it all. You get real photos of golf courses, their history, audio narration, and video clips of pro players. Conclusion DOSBox is how you emulate DOS games on your modern PC. While most of these are abandonware or shareware by now, I recommend purchasing a copy if it’s still available for sale on GOG. Not because some publisher will barge into your house with a team of lawyers, nobody cares about old DOS games now. But it’s the right thing to do because none of these games cost more than a couple of dollars.

2023-09-29T15:05:51,15 Best Dos Games To Play On Android,"Being able to emulate old DOS games is amazing, but even more so if it’s on the go. There are a few Android DOSBox versions that will play all your favorite retro games just the way you remember them. You can use onscreen controls, or connect a keyboard + mouse, which is the preferred way of playing if you’re at home. To help you get started, here are the 15 best DOS games to play on Android. Some are old-school shooter games that control surprisingly well on a phone, others are platformers that seem like they were made for this type of handheld gaming. So without further ado, let’s get the list started- Quake It’s an evolution of the Doom formula, with real-time 3D rendering and hardware acceleration support via OpenGL. The Quake engine was designed from the ground up to facilitate an entirely new generation of FPS games. Quake had a unique aesthetic, inspired by medieval and gothic culture, with a darker tone compared to Doom which felt like an action game. While Doom initially had just local co-op and deathmatch, Quake featured online multiplayer from the start. It revolutionized competitive shooters in the same way that Starcraft 1 revolutionized the competitive RTS scene. Some of the world’s first “pro” gamers on PC were in fact, Quake players. Heretic It’s a medieval wizard fantasy version of Doom, with a slightly more developed plot and new gameplay features. You can look up and down, which lets you scan the environment much better for traps and enemies. Speaking of the environment, some parts of it are interactable, unlike Doom where the environment is a static mesh. In Heretic, you’ve also got an inventory system to manage all your potions and power-ups. If you get the morph-ovum, it can be used on nearby enemies to transform them into harmless critters. There are weapons modifiers like the Tome of Power which adds a secondary firing mode to your weapon, one that’s often more powerful while also adding a new visual effect. Dangerous Dave John Romero created Dangerous Dave in 1988 as a practical example to accompany his article about GraBASIC (an Applesoft BASIC addon) in the UpTime disc magazine. Yes, disc magazines were a thing back then and they were awesome. More to the point, this game has no right to be as good as it is, considering that’s a glorified tech demo. For Dangerous Dave, Romero took heavy inspiration from Mario. You have a simple 2D side-scroller, going from left to right, and your main character can jump. There are gold cups to collect, monsters to defeat, and secret rooms to find. Albion Albion is a late-stage DOS game that arrived in North America in 1996, after its initial German release just one year prior. What makes it unique is the sci-fi setting that incorporates elements of magical fantasy. Originally intended for the Amiga, it had to be reworked for MS-DOS because Commodore went bankrupt. For a simplistic DOS game with a relatively low budget, Albion’s story and world are quite richly detailed with several interesting characters and memorable locations. It’s a party-based RPG, and you have a total of 6 members per party, each with unique abilities. Gameplay centers around exploration, dialogue, trading, and puzzle-solving. Commander Keen Possibly one of the most fun games you can play on your Android phone, Commander Keen is a side-scrolling action platformer. Its titular character is the alter ego of Billy Blaze, an 8-year-old genius who travels through space to fight evil and solve mysteries. There are 6 episodes, separated into 4 games. Gameplay involves jumping across platforms and using your pogo stick in strategic locations to jump even higher with proper timing. You aren’t defenseless, like the protagonists of some other platformers. Commander Keen is armed with a raygun, which comes in handy if your pogo jump doesn’t work on an enemy. X-COM: UFO Defense A turn-based tactics game with some real-time management elements mixed in. UFO Defense puts you in charge of a secret global paramilitary org called X-COM, its task is to defend planet Earth from an alien invasion. You build teams of operatives to carry out missions around the world. In addition to the turn-based tactics, this also plays like a 4X grand strategy game. You monitor X-COM bases using a global map, request new technologies be researched, allocate additional fighter jets and military units to hot zones, etc. All the while, you’re also recruiting new personnel and reverse-engineering alien tech (or selling it on the black market). The Secret Of Monkey Island Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert came up with the idea for Monkey Island in 1988 after he was frustrated with the difficulty of contemporary adventure games. He wanted a game that was primarily about exploration and worldbuilding, solving puzzles, engaging in conversations, etc. So he took the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride as inspiration and collaborated with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman to create this game in the SCUMM engine. Fun fact, all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are also based on the same Disney Land ride. It’s the last theme park ride that was built under Walt’s personal supervision. In Secret of Money Island, you move with your mouse and interact with objects by choosing one out of 12 commands (talk, pick up, etc.). Daggerfall The second Elder Scrolls game, and it’s considered by some to be the best in the series from a pure roleplaying perspective because of how closely it mirrors a pen & paper experience. Daggerfall was one of the earliest games to use random generation, which is why its game world is almost as big as Great Britain in real life. There are 15,000 cities and towns for you to visit within the game, and each one of them contains unique NPCs, quests, items, etc. Prince of Persia Based on folk tales from the Arabian Nights, Prince of Persia is an action platformer in which you play a nameless hero trying to rescue the princess. She has been kidnapped by Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier who took advantage of the Sultan being busy with a war in foreign lands. As the “Prince”, you’re armed with a sword and excellent parkour skills. You can run, jump, and crawl along ledges. Prince of Persia has the smoothest and most lifelike animations of any platformer from the 1990s because it uses rotoscoping. Jordan Mechner recorded footage of his own brother doing stunts in white garments and digitized the output for his game. Sid Meier’s Civilization If you’re a fan of strategy, you might’ve heard of Sid Meier’s Civilization. Well, here’s where it all began- in 1991. Civilization is a 4X turn-based strategy game, and it is both deeply complex and incredibly entertaining at the same time. You are the chief leader of a fledgling civilization, supervising and guiding their growth across millennia through various ages of progress. By exploring new areas, building alliances with other nations, and securing valuable resources you can improve the strength and status of your civilization. As a leader, you’re also supposed to handle technological advancements, military, science, infrastructure, and education. SimCity 2000 Its predecessor, SimCity Classic, showcased everything from a top-down perspective. While good for immediately identifying buildings and locations, it doesn’t provide enough information on the work happening at any given time. To fix this, SimCity 2000 switched to an isometric camera. Gameplay, music, and controls were also improved to provide players with a more tactile and engaging experience. Some new facilities were added, like schools, prisons, museums, hospitals, etc. You can build highways, bus depots, and nine different types of power stations, and allocate land for airports. Command & Conquer: Red Alert A prequel to the original, it’s set in an era when the Allies were battling the Soviets for control over Europe. Unlike Total Annihilation or Warcraft, opposite factions don’t have units that look different but ultimately do the same thing with slightly tweaked stats. This means you have to produce units that play to your strengths instead of just relying on overpowering the enemy with numbers. Master of Magic A game that combines random generation, roleplaying, high fantasy, and 4X grand strategy. It’s almost overwhelming at first. But once you get a feel for how exploration and resource gathering work, you’ll be laying down new cities with your settlers in no time. Each time you start, you’re given a new randomly generated world to play with and you can adjust various aspects like size, difficulty, magic, etc. You can customize the appearance and skills of your wizard, and choose from one of 14 races to populate your starting city. Star Wars: Dark Forces In Dark Forces, you play Kyle Katarn- a mercenary who works for the Rebels. At the start, you’re tasked with finding the plans for a new Death Star being built by the Empire. Eventually, you find a weakness in the design and exploit this to destroy the giant space station. For your next mission, you’re hired by the Alliance to investigate a new type of trooper that’s been attacking their space station. These new Imperial soldiers are part of the Dark Trooper project and have significantly improved capabilities compared to regular Stormtroopers. In the final mission, you infiltrate the ship at the core of the Dark Trooper project and destroy it. For this, you’re awarded the Star of Alderaan. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans Warcraft is one of the OG real-time strategy games, along with Starcraft. What sets Warcraft’s gameplay apart (as compared to Starcraft) is its lowered scale, focusing on skill-based tactical management of relatively few units. You can play as humans or orcs. Conclusion I hope this list gives you an idea of what game types work well on Android devices. Ideally, it should be compatible with the mobile versions of DOSBox. So full controller/ keyboard and mouse support, along with zero audio or gameplay glitches. Most games will be compatible, but they won’t play well on the small screen. Or they won’t adapt to the widescreen format, so you’ll have to mess around in settings. Platformers and adventure games are ideal for gaming on the go, i.e. games like Dangerous Dave and Commander Keen.

2023-09-28T11:15:17,15 Best Retro Games To Play On Steam Deck,"Ever since Valve launched its handheld gaming system in early 2022, the Steam Deck community has been trying to run all sorts of games on it- both old and new. Thanks to Valve’s open-source approach to software design with SteamOS, you can run a variety of emulators on this little “console”. Nearly every major 6 th and 7th-generation console game will run smoothly on the Deck, so you’ve got many options for retro gaming on this system. Today, I shall take a look at the 15 best retro games to play on Steam Deck. The ideal retro game for Steam Deck is one that lets you do meaningful progression in short 20 to 30-minute play sessions, and it must look on a small display. Old RPGs and platformers are perfect because they can easily hit a locked 30/ 60FPS via emulation, even on the Steam Deck’s relatively anemic processor. Mario Kart 64 A game that defined an entire console generation, Mario Kart 64 combines moment-to-moment fun with gameplay that’s deeper than you might think. It can be enjoyed solo, or with up to 3 friends if you connect some wireless controllers to your Steam Deck. Remember, this is all running via emulation so there’s no guarantee that you can make it work on EmuDeck . If you can’t get the multiplayer to work, Mario Kart 64 has decent enough AI to keep you entertained (they still rubberband and cheat like crazy). The graphics are nothing to write home about, yet something about the way this game handles character art and vehicle models stands out. In an age of derivative game design, it looks unique and instantly memorable. Of course, you can hook up your deck to a large display (like a monitor or TV) and enjoy the game as originally intended. But it looks very good even on a small screen. There are eight playable characters divided into 3 weight classes, each weight class has different stats for vehicle acceleration and top speed. Ratchet & Clank By 2000, at the turn of the century, Insomniac had become a household name within the PlayStation community with their successful Spyro series about a friendly little dragon. With the PS2, they introduced gamers to Ratchet and Clank- a dynamic spacefaring duo comprised of an anthropomorphic alien and his robot sidekick. At its core, Ratchet and Clank is a 3D action platformer in which you have tons of gadgets, cool weapons, and diverse enemy types. You solve puzzles, navigate through harsh terrain filled with traps, and complete missions across various exotic locations. It’s Tomb Raider in space with 20 times the gadgets and weapons, and a very stylized art style. A more entertaining formula if you ask me. Metal Gear Solid 3 With PS2 emulation, Metal Gear Solid 3 performs very well on Steam Deck. You can even play the remastered HD edition, released for PS3, using RPCS3. I suggest you play around with the render settings to see what suits you best, OpenGL and Vulkan are the two best APIs for this game on RPCS3. As for gameplay, Metal Gear Solid 3 doesn’t glitch or lag at all on the Deck. You can fiddle around with the controls and remap them so that the touchpad works as Circle and Square. Because the touchpads on Steam Deck are pressure-sensitive, you can use them for aiming or hostage control just like in the PS2 version. Resident Evil 4 RE4 is the primary reason behind the popularity of the 3 rd person action-adventure shooter during the mid-2000s. This game along with Gears of War made that genre, so it’s easy to take the current crop of 3 rd person AAA shooters for granted. But the Resident Evil series wasn’t always like this, it used to be a proper survival shooter with narrow hallways and tiny rooms. RE1 and RE2 had fewer enemies, and they gave you way less ammo so you had to plan all your actions beforehand. Your character wasn’t as mobile as Leon in RE4, and fixed camera angles helped create more tension by limiting your situational awareness. Despite all this, RE4 became the best-selling game in the series pretty much right after its exclusive release on GameCube. People loved the action movie vibe and revamped combat system. If you’re going to emulate this, I suggest giving both the GameCube and PS2 versions a try since they do have subtle differences. Textures and lighting are better on GameCube, but the PS2 port has additional content (like the Separate Ways campaign featuring Ada Wong). GoldenEye 007 The N64’s controller was weird and awkward to hold. But it did have a feature no other controller offered at the time, and that was an analog stick. GoldenEye 007 made excellent use of this stick by letting you aim with it and even went one step further by supporting a dual controller setup. You’d hold two controllers, one in each hand, and use the left controller for movement while the right one handled aiming. So technically, GoldenEye was the first game to use a dual-stick layout, not Halo: CE. Thankfully, you don’t have to go through all that trouble when you emulate GoldenEye 007 on Steam Deck. Halo: Combat Evolved For a moment, let’s use console shooters as an analogy for evolution. GoldenEye 007 would be the first fish that crawled out of the oceans and onto land, growing legs to walk around. And Halo: Combat Evolved would be the moment when the early man discovered fire. That’s quite a big leap forward, and it happened in just 4 years. Now, you can enjoy this legendary FPS in all its glory while on the move. In a way, you could say that Halo has returned home- to the PC, where it has always belonged (the original Xbox was just a semi-custom Windows PC). TimeSplitters 2 After every monumental leap forward in game design, you’ll see several copycats pop up to ride the tide. When Doom became a massive hit in the early 1990s, there was an entire crop of Doom clones. Some of these were quite innovative and unique, like Heretic- the others were just a waste of disk space. A similar pattern appeared after the success of GoldenEye 007 on N64, yet few managed to recapture the magic. Among these is TimeSplitters 2, an amazing adventure through time, filled with eccentric characters who wield all sorts of wacky weapons. Compared to GoldenEye 007, TimeSplitters offers you far more tools and tactical choices on how to complete the predefined objectives in each mission. Metroid Prime Nintendo recently released a remastered version of Metroid Prime on the eShop. But if you don’t want to throw down 40 bucks for a digital copy of a game that you already own since the GameCube/ Wii days, there’s a much better way to play it. Simply create a backup ROM of the game and run it on Dolphin. Metroid Prime looks great on Deck, and there’s zero input lag. It’s also one of the most stable GameCube titles for emulation, and you can play the whole trilogy at a locked 60FPS. If you go with PrimeHack (a specialized fork of Dolphin), you can play these games with controls that are no different from any modern PC shooter. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time To this day, Ocarina of Time is considered one of the top 3 Zelda games ever, right alongside A Link to the Past and Breath of the Wild. Released for Nintendo 64 in 1998, this is the first 3D Zelda game and has Z-targeting so Link can easily focus on any enemy within your field of view. It also has context-sensitive actions and a ton of interactable objects in every part of the world. As you play through the game, you gain the ability to solve music-based puzzles (some of these will require backtracking through various levels). The game’s plot makes you skip seven years into the future, with adult Link gaining exclusive access to certain weapons like the Fairy Bow. God of War: Ghost of Sparta While the mainline God of War trilogy on PS2 and PS3 is very popular among fans of hack ‘n slash, few know about the existence of this PSP spin-off. It features a similar style of combat to mainline GoW titles, with a heavy focus on extravagant combos that look awesome yet are relatively easy to execute. There are plenty of cinematic set pieces and fully voice-acted cutscenes, making this feel like a regular GoW game instead of a scaled-down mobile game. It’s also one of the best-looking PSP games you can play, with emulation enhancements improving the visuals even further if you play on Steam Deck. On original hardware, the game drops frames during intensive fights that involve lots of enemies on screen at the same time. But if you play on Steam Deck, you can easily maintain a locked 60FPS. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories Canonically, the timeline of Vice City is set during the mid-1980s. Vice City Stories is a PSP spinoff prequel set from that period featuring “Vic” who’s a side character in the mainline game. Vic is a former soldier, creating a drug empire to raise money for his sick brother’s medical procedures. The central gameplay is that of a 3 rd person shooter on an open-world map with driving. You also have an empire-building minigame where rival businesses can be taken over, and unique missions are available to boost the income you generate from each business. The PSP version of this game also had multiplayer via an ad-hoc network, up to 6 players could connect and participate in different game modes. Super Mario World Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped by Bowser’s underlings, Mario and Luigi must rescue her from the evil guy’s castle. The very first Mario title for SNES, Super Mario World is very similar to Super Mario Bros. for NES. But it features a brand-new overworld and mobility mechanics that had never been seen before. From the overworld, you can select action segments that load you into linear levels filled with obstacles and enemies. Every time you clear one of these action segments, you’re one step closer to the end of a “world” and rescuing your princess from the final castle. In addition to dashing and jumping, you can also fly and float using a cape gifted to you by Yoshi (who makes his first appearance in this game). Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater is an iconic video game series that PS1 and PS2 gamers from the 1990s/ early 2000s love to this day. But grabbing a PS2 in good condition along with copies of games that were originally released over 2 decades ago is hard, for obvious reasons. This is why the developers at Vicarious Visions created a fully remastered collection in 2020, featuring both PS1 games (Pro Skater 1 and 2) in HD with updated controls. Technically, this isn’t a retro game, but a remaster. And you don’t require emulation to play it, since it runs natively on Steam Deck. The remaster stays faithful to the originals but also adds new tricks from later Tony Hawk titles. Burnout Revenge The last old-school Burnout title before the series transitioned to an open-world layout with Paradise. Burnout Revenge is an arcade street racer with tons of high-octane carnage, you’re encouraged to do stunts and crash into other racers (like other games in the series). There’s a Road Rage game mode where your goal is to make as many of your enemies crash within a given period. Burning Lap is a time attack mode, with one car and one lap. There’s also an elimination mode, where the last vehicle in the race is removed every 30 seconds. Breaking the rules and smashing into others increases your boost gauge, which you can use to unleash even more damage on your opponents. Spyro: Reignited Trilogy Just like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, this isn’t a “true” retro game but a remaster of a retro game series. It features updated graphics and control schemes for modern systems and will run natively on Deck without emulation (available on the Steam Store). If you want, you can go back and play the original Spyro games via emulation but I recommend you give this one a try first. Conclusion Let’s say you can only carry one handheld gaming system with you, and you have to choose between Nintendo’s Switch and Valve’s Steam Deck. Tough choice, but I can make it simple by telling you that the Steam Deck will play Switch games via emulation. Nintendo won’t like this and you certainly shouldn’t be downloading ROMs off shady websites, but you can run backups of your Switch games on a Deck. This is interesting for several reasons, mainly because retro games can be customized to run at improved resolutions (or higher framerates). You get a superior experience on the larger display, not to mention the fact that Steam Deck’s joysticks feel better. The only downside is that Steam Deck is larger and has worse battery life than Nintendo’s Switch.

2023-09-20T16:49:00,15 Best DOS Action Games That Are Worthwhile,"Action games these days are usually limited to the 3 rd person variety, with an open world that’s wider than the Pacific Ocean yet shallower than a puddle. Compare this to DOS action games from 3 decades ago which came in every genre conceivable, from platformer to shooter. And I’m not just talking about first-person shooters, but also 2D top-down shooters that involved tanks and spaceships. Today, I shall take a look at the 15 best DOS action games that are worthwhile. No matter your preference, you’re guaranteed to find an action game here that appeals to your fantasies. Whether it’s a shooter, brawler, fighting game, platformer, RPG, sports title, or hybrid- DOS has got it all. Rise of the Triad If you look at the cover art for this game, it seems like you’re about to play some kind of tactical espionage shooter in which you infiltrate secret bases. There’s a guy with a WW2-era SMG and a girl who’s shooting off into the distance while holding a guard who’s been knocked out. And you know what, the game is indeed about spying. You’re part of a special forces team known as HUNT, tasked with monitoring and sabotaging the operations of a deadly cult that’s headquartered on a remote island. Unlike most other shooters of the 1990s, you can pick from a selection of five unique operators, each with distinct attributes such as speed and armor. Enemies behave unpredictably, sometimes they will beg for you to spare their lives, and other times they will pretend to be dead and ambush you from behind. Depth Dwellers What makes Depth Dwellers unique is the fact that it was originally intended to be used with 3D glasses. Remember guys, this is a DOS shooter from 1994. Over a decade before 3D became a thing in PC gaming (remember those overpriced gaming monitors with NVIDIA 3D support?). The game’s levels are set in underground caves that are filled with mechanical opponents and various treasures. Your goal is to get to one of the many teleportation gates that act as exits for the level while collecting as many secret items and treasures as possible. Sometimes, you’ll even find slaves who can be freed for bonus points. Little Big Adventure One of the earliest games in the action-adventure genre, Little Big Adventure has a very distinct graphical style. It meshes 3D polygonal characters with prerendered 2D environments, to create a “2.5D” effect. The game is also quite cinematic, with FMV cutscenes interspersed between important junctions. It should be noted that FMV cutscenes, fully voiced dialogue, and high-quality music are only present on the CD-ROM version of this game. Your player character is shown from an isometric viewpoint and has 4 behavior modes- normal, sporty, aggressive, and discreet. Combat is done by throwing magical balls of energy at enemies, and your abilities will vary depending on your behavior mode. Redneck Rampage Stylish, funny, and filled to the brim with high-octane action. This game is an interactive version of that terrible Hollywood movie from 2011 called Cowboys & Aliens. If you ever wanted to see cowboys fighting off an alien invasion with their double-barrel shotguns and six-shooters, don’t watch that movie, play this game instead. Magic Carpet It’s no Microsoft Flight Sim, and you control a carpet instead of an airplane. But some people prefer carpets to planes. And the experience of being a wizard on a flying carpet who goes around sieging castles full of armed guards is executed very well. You visit 45 different worlds, with the simple task of building a castle in each one. After building a castle, you must empower it with mana. There is a fixed amount of mana in each world, which is gained primarily by blowing up the castles of enemy wizards. MDK A game that was ahead of its time and had some truly monumental system requirements as a result. MDK required a 60MHz Pentium CPU or better, along with 16MB of RAM. This would have put it at the top of the most demanding games chart, making it the Crysis of the 1990s. All these system requirements weren’t for nothing, as MDK boasted some extremely large levels and highly detailed character models. It looked and played like nothing else, letting you switch from 3 rd person view to 1 st person if you equipped your sniper rifle. You can use a parachute to glide between large gaps in levels and call airstrikes on enemy objects. MechWarrior 2: 31 st Century Combat MechWarrior is a game about giant stompy robots, set in the 31 st century where humankind has expanded hundreds of light years into space. The BattleMechs is a revolutionary new weapons platform that provides superior firepower, mobility, and protection compared to normal armored fighting vehicles such as tanks. The game is set in a universe where rival space nations have been at war with each other for hundreds of years. It features tactical mech combat showcased from a first-person view of a pilot sitting in the cockpit. Missions take place on giant open-ended levels. Your mission objectives can vary from search and destroy to reconnaissance and infiltration. Star Wars: TIE Fighter If you’re a fan of Star Wars and space combat sims, this game should be a no-brainer. It uses the same engine as X-Wing, with new technologies such as Gouraud shading. As a result of improvements to the 3D rendering model, it looks amazing for a game that’s nearly 3 decades old at this point. The story is set right after the events that took place on Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back. As the pilot of a TIE fighter, you go up against rebel alliance members and pirates. As the story progresses, you discover and stop a coup attempt against Emperor Palpatine, for which he personally rewards you at the end. Alien Carnage Also known as Halloween Harry, this is a side-scrolling action platformer in which you control special agent Harry as he tries to stop an alien invasion. Yes, I know- a bunch of shooting games in the 1990s featured some kind of alien invasion. It all started with Duke Nukem. Aliens were to shooters of the 1990s what Vikings are to open-world action-adventure games of today. In Alien Carnage, you must rescue hostages to refill health (you can also eat junk food that’s lying around each level). You can fly for short bursts with a jetpack but don’t use it too often because both your jetpack and flamethrower share fuel. Scorched Earth I believe that at least half of all gamers who grew up in the 1990s and early 2000s have played this game, or a variation of it at some point in their childhood. Scorched Earth is best described as a turn-based 1 v 1 dueling game with tanks in which you lob comically outrageous weapons at each other along a ballistic arc. You get to choose a firing angle (elevation or depression) for your gun barrel, and the amount of power at which you lob the projectile. Doom II: Hell on Earth Advances in computer hardware meant that Doom II could have larger levels, with more enemy types and weapons than its predecessor. Levels are also more complex, allowing you to take a non-linear approach that rewards exploration. Doom II sees the action go from a scientific facility on Mars to Earth itself, which has now been infested with a demon invasion. The Doom Guy slaughters demons across 32 levels, with the difficulty ramping up as you advance towards the climax. In the final level, you go up against a massive demon the size of a skyscraper, known only as the Icon of Sin. Carmageddon Twisted Metal had already been out for 2 years, but DOS gamers had no way of enjoying it since that game was for Windows PCs only. Fortunately, a very similar experience can be had with Carmageddon. Instead of closed arenas, you have an entire city to yourself. Carmageddon is a game in which you’re rewarded for smashing up your enemy’s vehicles and running over pedestrians. Because of its violent nature, it was censored in several countries such as the UK and Germany. There are a total of 36 race tracks, distributed between 11 locations. BioForge It’s a bit of an interactive movie, with combat elements wedged in rather than a proper action game. BioForge tells the story of a cyborg who has lost his memory, trying to escape from a scientific research center that’s conducting experiments on him. This is one of the earliest video games to make use of motion capture technology. It also has fully voice-acted dialogue and several cinematic camera angles for each stage. The story is also disseminated via notes, diaries, and research logs written by scientists who worked at the facility. As a cyborg, you have access to various built-in weapon systems (these require energy cells that must be replaced). Abuse Its plot is similar to that of BioForge, with one key twist. Instead of just one person being experimented on, you have an entire prison full of inmates who are being used as lab rats. One day, there’s a riot at the facility and everyone gets infected with a toxin that turns them into monsters. But you are immune to this toxin, known simply as “Abuse”. And now, you must find a way through the hordes of mutated zombies who are all out to get you. Battle Chess I know what you’re thinking- “How can Chess be mistaken for an action game?”. But this is no ordinary game of chess. It’s more like that magical chess board from Harry Potter with giant stone pieces that murder each other in real life. Battle Chess is fully 3D, and every time you make a successful move on another unit, it’s massacred in a brutal fashion. Each piece has a different attack animation based on what it’s going up against. For example, the Rook kills pawns by turning into a stone goliath and smashing their heads. Conclusion Even within a genre as saturated as the DOS first-person shooter, there was a ton of variety. Redneck Rampage is a hillbilly simulator that mocks rural Western tropes while also arming you with enough weapons and special powers to conquer an entire nation. Rise of the Triad is a James Bond-esque action shooter RPG hybrid with multiple playable characters, each of whom has unique attributes. If you’re more interested in games like Burnout and Twisted Metal, I suggest you give Carmageddon a try since it has no shortage of vehicular carnage. Or maybe you like space combat sims, in which case Star Wars: TIE Fighter is perfect for you. There’s a ton of variety in my list of DOS action games, and they’re all abandonware so pick one that looks good and give it a try.

2023-09-16T10:32:00,15 Best DOS Sports Games That You Must Check,"Whether it’s football, golf, hockey, or motorsports, DOS has a rich and diverse library of sports games for everyone. There are 2D sports games, 3D sports games, and text-based sports games. Some are simulation-oriented, while others don’t take themselves too seriously and just try to have fun. Today, I shall take a look at the 15 best DOS sports games that you must check out. Of course, there’s a lot more than just 15 in the DOS library but I’m only including the most popular and revolutionary titles here. There was plenty of cheap shovelware back then, and trust me- you don’t want to play that stuff. John Madden Football Initially, Trip Hawkins (the designer) approached Joe Montana and Joe Kapp to endorse his football game which would be created in the same vein as Strat-O-Matic. However, Montana already had a deal with Atari, and Kapp was charging too much. So two years go by, and guess who agreed to put his name on the box- John Madden himself. John Madden Football was received favorably by critics who appreciated the combination of simulation elements with arcade-like features. If you wanted a simple practice run, you could hop into Quick Mode. And for those who wished to go all-in on stats and team building, there was the Standard Game mode. Double Dribble Made by Konami and released for arcades in 1986, Double Dribble eventually got a PC port one year later. With a massive side-scrolling court, smooth animations, cinematics, and accurate player models, Double Dribble was considered the most realistic basketball game of its time. When a player performed a slam dunk, you’d get an animated cinematic sequence that was stylish and impactful. 3D CyberPuck The single most obscure sports game on DOS, 3D CyberPuck is what happens when you combine hockey with spaceships. After all, the only thing more exciting than hockey is hockey with rocket boosters and sci-fi gadgets. You get many exciting powerups, such as the Gravity Well which can be dropped in the middle of the play area to attract the ball. You can also deploy a portable wall that bounces the hockey ball once before breaking. Everyone is driving a rocket ship, and you get shields that prevent your opponent from stealing your ball. Sometimes, you can even drop mines that send the ball flying in a random direction with great speed. 4D Sports Boxing Despite the name, this isn’t a 4D game. However, it’s 3D which I feel is more than enough for most people- we aren’t quite ready for the metaphysical plane yet. This is one of the earliest games to feature 3D opponents in the ring, and they are made of polygons. Boxers in this game are loosely based on real-world fighters and have varied stats. Some punch hard, others punch fast. If you play as the champ, you have extremely high attributes in all aspects of boxing. Hardball III The PC version of Hardball III contains more complex game mechanics compared to the SNES and Sega Genesis versions. For starters, logging your seasonal stats is a much more seamless process on a PC because you have a hard disk drive. Consoles had to go through an elaborate password-based process to do the same thing. Upon release in 1992, Hardball III was praised for its wonderful integration with VGA graphics and modern soundcards of the era. Its animations, stat system, and team mechanics were also revolutionary for being hyper-realistic compared to the more arcade-themed baseball games prevalent during the 1990s. NHL ‘94 Back when EA Sports wasn’t universally, NHL ’94 was one of its premier products. It’s one of the earliest multiplatform ice hockey games and is licensed by both the NHL and NHL Player’s Association. Unlike other hockey games of its era, NHL ’94 used an isometric camera angle that offered you a bird’s eye view of all the action. While characters were still represented via 2D sprites, their animations were significantly upgraded. New mechanics like the “one-timer” were added, along with the ability to save records. All of this, combined with the 4 new game modes made NHL ’94 one of the best sports games of all time. R.B.I. Baseball 2 The second game in the R.B.I Baseball series, it’s fully licensed and features all major league teams along with every player from the 1990 roster. If you want, you can even choose to play as one of the 1989 All-Star squads. You can play solo, 1 v 1, or a full season against every team in the division. Action Soccer If you just want to have some good old-fashioned fun without getting realistic, Action Soccer is perfect for you. Its cartoonish theme is further accentuated by the comedic timing and sarcastic commentary of Jonathan Pearce. You can play solo against the computer, or against another person in 2-player mode. The isometric 3D camera is perfect for fast-paced action, and you can choose from a wide range of unique player characters while building your team. Each character has attributes such as speed, skill, strength, etc. The weather changes during the game and adds a new layer of complexity to what’s already a very intense experience. Grand Prix 2 It’s from 1996 and still manages to be more realistic than some modern racing games. Every aspect of the cockpit in an F1 car is rendered with great attention to detail, and you get to choose between 16 different circuits- all from the 1994 F1 season. Since this game is officially licensed, you also get all 28 drivers and 14 teams. You can do practice, qualifying laps, and the actual race just like in the real world. Cars can be customized, and mechanical failures in the engine, electronics, frame, etc. are modeled accurately. If you want, you can turn on or turn off driving aids like auto shifting, traction control, and power steering. Skate or Die Long before Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, there was Skate or Die- the first game to be developed internally by EA. The game has five unique skating events that you can compete in individually or as part of a sequential tournament format. You can sign up to 8 players for the tournament, and compete with your real-life friends to see who can pull off the sickest tricks. MicroLeague Wrestling Unlike wrestling games you’re familiar with in the current era, this isn’t a 3D-action game. Instead, it’s a text-based professional wrestling simulator that’s licensed by the WWF. It features superstars like Hulk Hogan, Macho Man, Ted Dibiase, etc. in turn-based strategy matches where you select wrestling moves from a list of text options. In the middle of the screen, there’s a window that shows an image of your wrestler performing whichever move you selected (taken from actual matches). Moves are divided into basic and major types, performing a finisher helps you recover HP by rallying the crowd. Before each match, Mean Gene interviews the wrestlers. Sharkey’s 3D Pool Most pool games from this era have a 2D table with a pool stick that you can only angle in two dimensions- left and right. However, Sharkey’s 3D Pool lets you rotate the table along all 3 axes and vary the viewpoint on your cue stick for the perfect shot. You can even set the pace, spin, and strike angle depending on where you want your ball to go. Lakers vs. Celtics and the NBA Playoffs The first-ever basketball video game to be endorsed by the NBA, Lakers vs. Celtics features many top stars and teams from the 1980s. Its story is rudimentary but centers around the rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers. What makes the DOS version special is the fact that Kareem Abdul Jabbar is exclusive to this version of the game. MicroProse Soccer While Action Soccer is a cartoonish depiction of the sport that doesn’t take itself too seriously, MicroProse Soccer turns the dial all the way in the opposite direction. It’s a full-on simulation game in which you can recreate a game of football featuring 11 players on both sides. You can play the Indoor League (6-player-team), or go for a World Cup season (11-player-team). The Games: Winter Challenge With a name like this, it’s obvious that the developers couldn’t get an official license from the International Olympic Committee. Still, it’s based on the Winter Olympics and contains all the relevant events. You’ve got luge, downhill skiing, bobsled, ski jump, biathlon, etc. Conclusion You’ll be surprised to find that a lot of these games can still put you on the edge of your seat in excitement, with their engaging mechanics and level design. Sure, the graphics have aged very poorly and none of the control makes any sense in the modern era. But once you iron out the kinks, I’m sure you’ll find yourself immersed thoroughly in a virtual world of sports for hours on end.

2023-09-14T12:28:06,15 Best DOS FPS Games That You Must Play,"DOS gaming from the 1980s and early to mid-1990s is an era often overlooked when people talk about early first-person shooters. Everyone thinks FPS only became a thing after Windows and DirectX went mainstream, but that’s far from the truth. DOS was just as good for high-octane FPS action as it was for puzzle and adventure games. To revisit and celebrate this oft-forgotten era of FPS gaming, here are the 15 best DOS FPS games that you must play. You have the classics like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, these are pure shooters with awesome music and loads of bad guys to kill. However, I’ve also included a few games that mix and match genres to create truly unique experiences you won’t find anywhere else. Doom Doom’s success owes as much to its ingenious art design, as it does to the headbanging heavy metal soundtrack. The game’s levels are designed to be a cross between the sci-fi horror world of Alien, and the hellscape of Evil Dead. You’re armed with a small arsenal of murder paraphernalia, including classics like the chainsaw and double-barrel shotgun. As your nameless space marine claws his way through one demonic level after another, the enemies begin to get progressively stronger. Along the way, you find some amazing weapons like the BFG (take two guesses what that abbreviation means) which can clear out an entire room with one shot. Wolfenstein 3D The predecessor to Doom, Wolfenstein 3D evolved from the game “Castle Wolfenstein”, which was originally released on Apple II. Instead of the stealth mechanics present in the 2D action adventure it’s based on, Wolfenstein 3D embraces action and sci-fi. Most of the nazis in Castle Wolfenstein are regular people, armed with rifles and submachine guns. But you’ll occasionally come across cybernetically enhanced nazis, giant attack dogs, and various other evil contraptions that wouldn’t feel out of place in a James Bond movie. And the game culminates in a fight against Adolf Hitler in a mech suit, under the Reichstag. Needless to say, Wolfenstein 3D has plenty of blood and gore (which feels impactful even to this day). Quake Just as Doom was an evolution of Wolfenstein 3D with faster-paced shooting and more outlandish enemy designs, Quake is an advancement of Doom- with a much larger focus on multiplayer. Featuring music by Nine Inch Nails and eerie-looking levels inspired by medieval gothic art, Quake is darker and grittier than Doom. The game has both single-player and local multiplayer. What really sells the game, however, isn’t its wide and varied selection of weapons (which are amazing) or the unique gothic aesthetic. Instead, it’s the way you can move and how the physics works. Quake lets you rocket jump, bunny hop, and change direction while you’re flying in the air, making it the first-ever “movement shooter”. System Shock System Shock isn’t your traditional FPS. It’s not a game in which you take out hordes of bad guys with your overpowered weaponry while feeling like a badass 1980s action movie hero. Instead, you’re forced to feel like the weak underdog as you cautiously tiptoe around a derelict space station, listening to audio logs and trying to figure out what happened. Apart from space zombies and robots, you’re also being hunted by a rogue AI known as SHODAN who also happens to have a god complex. SHODAN wants you dead and will use the spaceship’s various systems against you. Enemies are few and far between, but the tension is high since you’re often armed with nothing more than a pistol and crowbar. Heretic Imagine Doom, but with roleplaying elements lifted straight out of Dungeons and Dragons. Heretic uses the Doom engine but adds several new features. For starters, you now have an inventory and the ability to use magical artifacts that give your weapons a secondary firing mode with much more powerful attacks. You can also look up and down, and the levels are often designed with an element of verticality to take advantage of this feature. Some of the levels will contain interactive elements, like streams of water that can carry you away. Weapons in Heretic perform similar functions to those of weapons in Doom but also have new and unique abilities. Instead of shotguns and rocket launchers, you’ve got claws, wands, bows, and staffs. Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri It’s like Titanfall, except this game was released in 1996- 18 years before Titanfall, and probably older than half of Titanfall’s player base. As for the story, it’s a weird mishmash of science fiction tropes and cold-war politics. In Terra Nova, a faction of humans escape the solar system to colonize Alpha Centauri, because Earth has been taken over by a totalitarian socialist government. In terms of gameplay, it’s very similar to MechWarrior 2, each motion of your mech suit feels weighted and tactile. You fight other mechs and vehicles in a massive 3D landscape full of divergent terrain features such as hills, lakes, forests, etc. Each mech comes with a wide range of weaponry, ranging from missiles and lasers to autocannons. You can have up to 3 AI teammates on your side, and each one of them can be given tactical commands (stop, rush, patrol, etc.). Duke Nukem 3D Aliens are invading the Earth, and it’s up to the Duke to stop them. If you like 1980s Hollywood action movies, sex jokes, and gratuitous amounts of gore, this game still has the potential to entertain in the current year. Its level design is very different from MechWarrior 2 or Terra Nova, which makes sense because Duke Nukem is not a tactical mech sim. Instead, it’s a power fantasy with a cigar-chomping badass who wields giant guns. Duke saves beautiful women from alien strongholds, flipping the middle finger as explosions go off in the background. The game contains plenty of power-ups and interactable objects in the environment, and each level is designed so that you have multiple paths for any given objective. Descent Doom was a revolutionary game by 1993 standards, but it wasn’t true 3D. Many games inspired by Doom managed to correct this by embracing full 3D, thanks to advancements in graphics processing. One of these games was Descent, which some consider to be the first “fully 3D” FPS. It has six degrees of freedom, only possible if your object is rendered in 3 axis (3D). The gameplay in Descent resembles that of an early 1980s 2D shoot ‘em up but from a first-person perspective. You pilot a spaceship through off-world mines, blowing up robots that have been infected by a computer virus. Star Wars: Dark Forces Set a year after the first Star Wars movie (original trilogy), Dark Forces tells the story of Kyle Katam. A Rebel Alliance merc who stumbles upon a secret project of the Empire, known only as “Dark Trooper”. The Dark Trooper project aims to create new battle droids and stormtroopers with power armor to significantly enhance their fighting ability. The game’s plot revolves around Kyle’s journey to shut down the Dark Trooper program. The gameplay is like that of any linear FPS from the mid-1990s, with plenty of droids and stormtroopers for you to destroy. Levels are massive and beautiful, taking place in a variety of familiar locations- Star Destroyer, Jabba the Hutt’s yacht, etc. Blood A dark fantasy game in which the protagonist, an undead 20th-century Wild West outlaw, is seeking revenge against his former master- a god of the underworld. It’s responsible for many of the video game censorship movements that took place during the 1990s, with parents claiming that games such as Doom and Blood were “demonic”. That they were turning kids into cultists, Satan worshippers, etc. Sure, Blood has plenty of gore and blood (duh) but it’s nothing more than an edgy FPS with an eerie and gritty atmosphere. Oh, and it’s also really, really, difficult. Not all is dark and serious, the game also has its moments of humor and contains several pop-culture references. Shadow Warrior Kung Fu movies have been one of my guilty pleasures since I was a child, and I suspect many of you reading this article love them as well. 3D Realms took a Kung Fu movie, combined it with a Hollywood action movie, and packaged the whole idea as a 3D FPS. Released in 1997, Shadow Warrior is one of the most entertaining shooters. Shadow Warrior got so many things right on the first try, it’s like Duke Nukem 3D but with even more depth and a larger number of interactable objects in the environment. The innovative room-over-room level layout makes it feel like you’re fighting through an enemy fortress, climbing your way toward the final boss like in a Castlevania game. You can drive vehicles, dual-wield machine guns, and throw ninja stars- 1990s FPS gaming doesn’t get much better than this. Chasm: The Rift Not every FPS game in the 1990s was unique or innovative, most were either shovelware or DOOM clones. However, every once in a while, we got games like Chasm: The Rift that pushed new boundaries in terms of gameplay and level design. While Doom and Blood reveled in gore and demonic themes, Chasm: The Rift combined science fiction with monster hunting. In this game, you’re a special forces commando tasked with preventing a mutant invasion of Earth. However, these mutants are time travelers and are invading Earth from different epochs distributed throughout our history. You travel to different time periods and take out these mutants one by one. Levels range from tombs in ancient Egypt to Aztec ruins and even current-day military facilities. Strife Much like System Shock, Strife merges two different genres- FPS and RPG. However, it leans much more into the Ultima Underworld style of roleplaying rather than the sci-fi horror trappings of System Shock. Strife features a combination of old weaponry along with new stuff- this is a world where crossbows and swords exist alongside machine guns and attack robots. Hexen: Beyond Heretic Developed by Raven and published by id Software, Hexen is a sequel to the dark fantasy FPS Heretic. You play as one of three heroes destined to defeat Korax, the Serpent Rider. What makes Hexen unique is its use of character classes, there are three in total, each with access to a unique combination of weapons and perks. Blam! Machinehead A game as weird as it is stylish, Blam! Machinehead is about a scientist who’s created a special vehicle to defeat a nanomachine infestation that’s taken over the world. You’re given tasks by a creepy assistant via video calls, and these sequences are portrayed as FMV cutscenes. Your vehicle is equipped with dual autocannons and missile launchers. Conclusion DOS FPS games manage to do so much with so little, some of these aren’t even “proper” 3D and use basic MIDI soundtracks. No cinematic cutscenes, voiced dialogue, or shoehorned RPG mechanics like crafting. You just got a cigar-chomping, one-liner-dispensing badass with a gun the size of Texas, and endless waves of despicable monsters to mow down. For a long time, that’s all an FPS player needed to have fun. As technology advanced, so did our expectations and game developers followed along, trying to give us everything we could possibly ask for. But somewhere along the way, in the pursuit of doing everything, modern FPS games have lost track of their core identity and what it means to just have fun.

2023-08-30T09:27:44,Can PS1 Controllers Work On PS2?,"With PlayStation, Sony introduced a revolutionary way to enjoy games that were now in full 3D and featured huge FMV cutscenes for a more cinematic experience. To navigate through this exciting new world gamers used the brand-new controller that had a D-pad with 4 face buttons (X, square, triangle, circle). It even had triggers for your middle fingers, something that every prior controller had lacked. But can PS1 controllers work on PS2? Yes, they will work on PS2 because both PS1 and PS2 controllers share the same port and basic control layout. Because PS2 uses a PS1 CPU as its I/O chip, it can perfectly read inputs from a PS1 controller and can even read PS1 memory cards . If you connect your PS1 controller to a PS2, make sure you’re not using it for a game that requires the DualShock. If the game doesn’t need analog sticks, you can play it just fine with a PS1 controller. Another thing to remember is that the PS1 controller doesn’t have pressure-sensitive buttons, while the DualShock does. PS1 Controller vs PS2 Controller If you open up both controllers you’ll see that they share much of the same basic circuitry with two exceptions. Firstly, the DualShock has two analog sticks and rumble motors. Secondly, it has pressure-sensitive buttons that are used by a small group of games such as Gran Turismo. What this means is that you can control the throttle and brake in Gran Turismo using just the X and square button rather than the right analog stick. This feature didn’t stick around for too long because it had more downsides than upsides. For example, people often found themselves slowing down in racing games just because they slightly lifted off on the X button. These days, the only pressure-sensitive parts of a controller are the triggers (L2 and R2). PlayStation 1’s controller had none of these fancy features, it didn’t have a rumble motor or analog sticks. Yet, games were designed around these limitations until the upgrade controller with analog sticks arrived in 1997. You don’t have to do anything special to make a PS1 controller work on PS2. Just plug it in like a DualShock and insert your PS1 disc into the tray. PS2 can also read PS1 memory cards (these will only work with PS1 games, not with PS2 games). Is A PS2 Controller Compatible With A PS1? Here’s the fun part- not only does a PS1 controller work flawlessly on PS2, but a PS2 controller will also work flawlessly on PS1. Because the controllers are so similar in how they process and send inputs, you can use them on either console. Just keep in mind the fact that many PS2 games require analog sticks so you can’t play them with a PS1 controller. What Controllers Work On A PS2? In addition to PS1 and DualShock controllers, PS2 can also support a small group of third-party controllers. The Logitech Wireless Action Controller is officially licensed and built quite well. You can also purchase modern 3 rd party controllers for your PS2, such as this one from Blue Lake Performance. Do PS1 Controllers Work On PS3? The DualShock 3 works perfectly for playing PS1 games on PS3, but you can’t use the original PS1 controllers. PS3 has USB ports rather than the old controller ports, which are used primarily for charging the wireless DualShock 3. If you want, you can purchase an adapter that makes PS1/ PS2 controllers work on PS3. Which PS2 Model Plays PS1 Games? All of them, because PS2’s I/O chip is just a PS1 CPU. Normally this works as a controller for the front ports, DVD drive, rear expansion slot, etc. But if a PS1 disc is detected, this I/O chip switches into backward compatibility mode. Did PS1 Have Joysticks? Not originally, but it got upgraded controllers in 1997 called Dual Analog. Eventually, this developed into the DualShock which would be used on PlayStation 2. Because Sony hadn’t quite figured out a durable enough rumble system, they removed rumble from the European and American releases of the Dual Analog controller. Thankfully, this feature was put back into DualShock for PS2. Conclusion I hope this article helped you understand more about the backward compatibility of PS2 with PS1 controllers. You can connect a PS1 controller to a PS2 as long as the game doesn’t require a DualShock. Some games even use the pressure-sensitive buttons of DualShock 2 and won’t work with a regular DualShock. For those who aren’t aware, the DualShock is an improved version of the Dual Analog controller that was originally released in 1997 for PS1. It added rumble, and the DualShock 2 is a DualShock with pressure-sensitive face buttons. Because it uses the same protocol as a PS1 controller, a PS2 controller can be connected to the PS1.

2025-02-01T19:28:24,"Nintendo Switch 2 price leak says it'll cost $400, which is far too high","A Nintendo Switch 2 price leak has surfaced, suggesting that Nintendo's next-gen console could cost $400 at launch. While the leak remains unconfirmed, the rumored pricing has already sparked debates among fans who believe it may be too expensive compared to other consoles on the market. Recent reports paint a conflicting picture of the Nintendo Switch 2's price point. Some leaks suggest a $400+ price tag, while others claim it could be lower, potentially around $350. However, industry analysts believe Nintendo is unlikely to launch its new system at a price that competes directly with the Xbox Series S or PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, both of which frequently see discounts. A listing leak in Latin America first hinted at a lower Switch 2 price, but many remain skeptical, pointing out that hardware improvements-such as an OLED screen, upgraded internals, and new Joy-Cons-could push the cost higher. With Nintendo yet to officially confirm anything, fans are left speculating whether the Switch 2 will follow in the footsteps of its predecessor's affordability or take a risk with a premium price point.

I primarily use ring lights for social media content creation and photography. When I bought the Sensyne, my expectation was that it could stay set up in my home office more regularly than my larger 18"" ring light. I was hoping it might also work well with my larger ring light when trying to illuminate a room or studio for photography.  The Sensyne Ring Light exceeded my expectations in some ways, but it disappointed me in others.

2023-08-22T09:25:01,Best MacBook 2023,"A MacBook can be a big investment, and the best MacBook for you isn't necessarily the one with the highest price tag. MacBook laptops are known for their style, their power and their easy-to-use interface, and this makes them popular with creatives, students and those who have already bought into the Apple ecosystem. One of the great things about getting a MacBook if you're already an Apple user, is you can expect a seamless experience across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS.  The MacBook range currently has five models to choose from, almost all of which are considered among the best laptops on the active market. Apple runs all their Macs on proprietary silicon chips, which integrate the CPU, GPU and unified memory (RAM) into one customisable chip. This makes all MacBooks fast, battery efficient and quiet, and who doesn't want that in a laptop? One thing to note is that you can't upgrade the memory and storage on a Mac after purchase. Once you've found the right MacBook model, using our handy buying guide, it's worth buying the biggest specification you can afford. More memory means a faster connection between the CPU, and more storage means you won't get stuck with no space for apps, photos and documents.  Confused? Don't worry. At Gear Nuke, we're all about making tech simple to understand, so that you get the best bang for your buck. We don't want you to end up with a rotten Apple (sorry).

2025-12-16T19:17:07,New PlayStation 6 Handheld Leak Claims Sony Is Prepping “Canis” Through PS5 Power Saver Mode,"A new leak claims Sony ’s PS5 Power Saver push is seemingly the groundwork for the PS6 handheld codenamed “Canis,” with dev docs hinting at fewer CPU threads and new Low Power Modes. Rumors around the PlayStation 6 have been coming in fast lately, and the handheld side of it is starting to sound less like fan fiction and more like a plan. The current leak pile includes a PS6 home console reportedly codenamed Orion, plus a native handheld codenamed Canis, both tied to AMD Zen 6 CPUs and RDNA 5 graphics. On the handheld hardware side, the same reports have suggested a portable system built around Zen 6c CPU cores , RDNA 5 compute units , 16GB of LPDDR5X memory . There are also repeated claims that Canis would support PS5 and PS4 backward compatibility , with a USB-C setup that could potentially allow TV play. Image: Sony | Rockstar Games via The Game Post Related: PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR 2 Reportedly Doesn’t Have Frame Generation in the Plans The most recent rumor before today was claimed Sony is strongly encouraging studios to support PS5’s “Low Power” mode , and not in the lazy “just cap it at 30 FPS” way. The claim was that Sony wants games to hold 60 FPS by dropping resolution and trimming CPU usage , basically to make sure PS5 titles behave on a lower-power profile later. Now, well-known hardware leaker, Moore’s Law is Dead, is back with some new leaked details around the PlayStation 6 handheld. PS5 Power Saver Mode Might Be Sony’s Handheld Compatibility Plan In the new Broken Silicon episode , MLID says a source told him Sony patched all PS5 dev SDKs back to version 1.0 to add Power Saver support, despite being “currently on 12.0.” He also claims Sony did not do this kind of backporting work even for PS5 Pro support, which is why he argues Power Saver support is the bigger priority internally. He then points to a CPU optimization document that allegedly mentions more Low Power Modes coming “eventually” and “directly suggests” games should be runnable on only eight CPU threads . The line he quotes from the document is: “new operation modes may be supported in the future and applications may run in environments with different available CPU configurations.” MLID also says his source wanted one point emphasized: Sony has “directly told them” this work will support new CPU architectures , and devs “cannot assume” the same thread counts forever. Image: Sony Related: PlayStation Leak Hints at “Cross-Buy” Feature, Possibly Between PS5, PC, and Rumored PS6 Handheld Here’s the full on-screen quote shown in the video from the leaker’s source: “Sony just patched all of their SDKs for PS5 game development back to 1.0 to support Power Saver Mode (they’re currently on 12.0). To be clear – they didn’t even do this for PS5 Pro support – if you had an old launch game on SDK 1.0 or 2.0, they’d tell you to ‘update to the latest SDK’ if you wanted to start working on adding direct PS5 Pro modes to your game. That means Power Saver Mode support is more important to them than Pro support! “Additionally, one doc talking about CPU optimizations mentions that there are new Low Power Modes coming eventually , and directly suggests that your games should be runnable on only 8-Threads…it even at one point states: ‘new operation modes may be supported in the future and applications may run in environments with different available CPU configurations’…Sony is definitely preparing a Canis Handheld!” If any of this is real, the implication is that Sony may be trying to make “PS5 Low Power” a common compatibility target, so a handheld can run more PS5 games without each title needing a special, painful rewrite.

2025-12-16T19:16:25,PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR 2 Reportedly Doesn’t Have Frame Generation in the Plans,"A new rumor about PS5 Pro’s PSSR 2 says Sony isn’t planning frame generation. If you’ve been keeping an eye on PS5 Pro news, PSSR 2 has quickly become the big “next year” rumor . The recent leaks claim Sony is working on a major upgrade to its PSSR upscaling for 2026 , with a new approach that’s supposed to look cleaner while using less memory and less GPU time. The chatter also says it would need game updates, since it may rely on a new API instead of being a simple switch. Now, a new round of details has surfaced, and it focuses on one feature some people assumed was coming along for the ride: frame generation. Image: Sony Related: “It’s not some 0.5 upgrade, it’s huge”: New leak claims PS5 Pro will get “PSSR 2” in 2026 using “Multi-Frame Super Resolution 2” to cut memory use and GPU time PS5 Pro PSSR 2 rumor says no frame gen The new comments come from hardware leaker and insider, Moore’s Law Is Dead in a new Broken Silicon episode , where he says he’s relaying what he’s hearing from developer sources and backend documentation. When the discussion turned to frame generation for the next version of PSSR, he shared a message he says came from a source familiar with Sony’s tooling. Here’s what he said: “A source I was talking about this [PSSR 2], then I just asked, ‘is there any reference to frame gen?'” Apparently, the source replied, “not a single one in the next PSSR. I haven’t heard a single developer ask Sony to add Frame Gen to PSSR.” He then follows with:”“not only is Sony not working on it, but they know that developers hate it, hate it, hate it.” The claim is not that frame generation is impossible on PlayStation, but that Sony’s next PSSR 2 upgrade is being treated as an upscaling and image-quality project, not a frame-gen initiative. One possible reason is that frame generation can come with tradeoffs like artifacts and inconsistent motion. Image: Sony Related: New PlayStation 6 handheld leak claims Sony “needs” devs to support PS5 Low Power mode and “maintain 60 FPS by lowering resolutions” to get games ready for launch As for the bigger PSSR 2 package, the earlier rumor set is still the same. The leaks have described PSSR 2 as “MFSR2” internally, with goals like needing fewer inputs, reducing memory use, cutting GPU processing time, and improving image quality versus current PSSR. There’s also talk of Sony shipping better debugging tools for teams, including a replay tool to help track down PSSR artifacting issues. As always, take all of this with a grain of salt. None of it is confirmed by Sony, and “developer sources” can mean anything from early notes to outdated plans. On the PS6 handheld side, the latest rumor says Sony’s new PS5 Power Saver push could be more than just saving electricity . In this same episode, Moore’s Law Is Dead claims a source told him Sony has patched every PS5 dev SDK back to version 1.0 so studios can add Power Saver support even on older builds, and that Sony is treating this as a bigger internal priority than PS5 Pro-specific work. He also points to a CPU optimization doc that allegedly hints at more Low Power modes coming, and says games should be able to run on only 8 CPU threads. The idea is that if PS5 games can reliably run in a lower-power profile, it becomes much easier to carry them over to the rumored PS6 handheld without every game needing a painful custom rewrite.

2025-12-14T18:51:31,Court Dismisses Ex-Marathon Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit Against Bungie and Sony,"A Delaware judge has tossed Christopher Barrett’s $200M lawsuit against Bungie and Sony, not on the facts, but because the case was filed in the wrong court. Former Marathon director Christopher Barrett filed his lawsuit against Bungie and Sony on December 12, 2024 , claiming the companies wrongfully fired him and did it, in his view, to dodge tens of millions in payments tied to Bungie’s post-acquisition agreements. The lawsuit came after public reporting about why Bungie let him go . Bloomberg reported that an internal investigation found Barrett acted inappropriately toward multiple women at the studio, and that at least eight female employees raised complaints. The report described things like flirty messages, comments about looks, and “truth-or-dare” conversations. Image: Bungie Related: Sony Details ‘Disturbing’ Text Messages in Response to Ex-Bungie Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit From Barrett’s side, the story has been that Bungie and Sony used him as a “scapegoat” and fired him to avoid paying him money tied to Bungie’s Sony acquisition and related deals. From Sony and Bungie’s side, the argument has been that he was terminated “for cause” after multiple reports from employees, and they’ve said they’ll fight the claims. Now, there’s a big development. In a new court order filed on December 10, 2025, and obtained by The Game Post, Delaware’s Court of Chancery has dismissed the case . Delaware court dismisses Chris Barrett lawsuit against Bungie and Sony The biggest thing to understand is that the judge did not decide who’s telling the truth about what happened at Bungie. Instead, the Court of Chancery said it cannot hear this dispute at all , because what’s left in the lawsuit is essentially about money damages . The order explains that the Court of Chancery is a limited court. It mainly handles certain kinds of disputes, like cases where someone is asking for special “equitable” fixes, not just money. “The case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,” the order reads. “The Court of Chancery is a court of limited jurisdiction. It possesses subject matter jurisdiction only when ‘(1) one or more of the plaintiff’s claims for relief is equitable in character, (2) the plaintiff requests relief that is equitable in nature, or (3) subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by statute.'” Image: Bungie Related: Bungie Takes Down Marathon ViDoc Featuring Former Director Chris Barrett Following Reports Of Inappropriate Behaviour The order also shows how this got to this point. On October 13, 2025 , the court issued an order asking why the case should not be thrown out for lack of jurisdiction. “On October 13, 2025, the court issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Dkt. 62. Only the defendants argued that subject matter jurisdiction exists. Dkt. 65. The Employee was happy to transfer the case to Superior Court. “Under Court of Chancery Rule, this court must dismiss a lawsuit when it lacks subject matter jurisdiction. This court has an independent obligation to evaluate whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.” The court walks through a few different attempts to keep the case in Chancery, and rejects them one by one. A lot of it comes down to the same idea that even if the dispute is tied to stock awards, merger-related agreements, or a payment plan, the remaining fight still looks like a fight over money payments , which is usually a “regular court” issue, not a Chancery issue. There’s also a moment where Sony and Bungie argued that questions about interest could matter later, and the judge basically says that is not enough to decide jurisdiction. “The defendants also contend that any claim to an award of interest would require interpreting the Merger Agreement. The question of interest will not come up until the end of the case, and then only if the Employee prevails. It is also unlikely that there will be a significant dispute over the interest rate. The interest rate tail should not wag the jurisdictional dog.” Image: Bungie Related: Sony and Bungie Call Former Director Chris Barrett’s $200M Lawsuit ‘Baseless Attempt To Obtain Hundreds Of Millions’ And when it comes to Barrett’s FMLA-related requests, the order notes that he asked for reinstatement, but the judge says it’s very unlikely the court would actually do that, and that money damages would probably cover it anyway. “Here, reinstatement may be theoretically available, but it is highly unlikely that the court would grant it. A damages remedy is highly likely to be adequate.” What happens next This dismissal does not automatically mean the dispute is over. The order lays out that Barrett can choose to move the case to Delaware Superior Court under a state transfer rule. “The plaintiff can make a timely election to have the matter transferred to the Delaware Superior Court.” For now, we’ll have to wait and see how this progresses further. This is also not the only lawsuit Sony is dealing with right now. Sony recently sued Tencent over Light of Motiram , accusing it of copying its Horizon games .

2025-12-13T16:15:50,Destiny 2 Loot Tables: All Raids And Dungeons Gear,"Discover comprehensive loot tables for all Destiny 2 raids and dungeons, detailing the exotic and legendary rewards players can earn from these challenging endgame activities. Destiny 2 offers an expansive universe filled with numerous activities for players to explore, but none are as challenging or rewarding as raids and dungeons. Raids in Destiny 2 are six-player cooperative missions that often span multiple encounters, each with unique mechanics and bosses. Dungeons, on the other hand, are typically three-player activities that offer a similar level of complexity and reward structure but on a smaller scale. They blend the difficulty of raids with the accessibility of smaller fireteams, providing a perfect middle ground for players who might not have a full team of six. Image: Bungie Both of these endgame activities offer a variety of unique rewards such as exotic weapons, legendary weapons, armor, and cosmetic items like emblems, Ghost shells, sparrows, and ships. If you’re looking for the complete list of Destiny 2 loot tables for all raids and dungeons, you’ve come to the right place.

2025-12-11T02:36:25,"Destiny 1 Players Say Their Accounts Have Been Deleted, With All Characters And A Decade Of Progress Suddenly Gone [UPDATE]","After a Destiny 1 maintenance earlier today, players are reporting that their accounts and characters are missing, with third-party tools also showing years of progress gone. Destiny 1 is more than eleven years old now, but for a lot of people, it is still the comfort game. Bungie has not added new content in a long time, yet the original raids, strikes, and Crucible still have a loyal core of players who log in to check off bounties, help new folks, or just relive some very specific 2014-2017 memories. Because of that, Destiny 1 usually sits quietly in the background while Destiny 2 gets all the updates and new content. It is rare to see a “Destiny 1 maintenance” announcement these days. That is exactly what happened today, though, and from what players are saying, it may have made things a lot worse for anyone still playing on the original game. Bungie: Destiny 1 Related: Destiny 3 in “Extremely Early Development” at Bungie, Leaker Claims Destiny 1 maintenance appears to have deleted player accounts and all characters According to the official downtime notice from Bungie, Destiny 1 was taken offline today, December 10, at 10 am PST for planned maintenance, with an expected end time of around 2 pm PST , while Destiny 2 only had background work running during that window. Once that window ended, Destiny 1 came back online. Very quickly after that, posts started to appear on Reddit and the Bungie.net forums from players saying that the game now treats their profile like a brand new account. Instead of loading into the Tower, they are being thrown straight to the character creation screen, with no sign of their old characters. Update, December 10, 7:03 PM PT: The issue appears to be resolved and servers are back online. Players checking third-party tools that read from Bungie’s API, such as Destiny Item Manager, WastedOnDestiny, and Destiny Raid Report, say those sites now show no Destiny 1 characters or activity for affected accounts. Everything looks as if the account has never touched Destiny 1 at all. Image: Bungie Related: New Details Surface on Destiny 1’s Original ‘Staten Cut’ Story Before the 2013 Reboot There have been tons of reports from players across social media. On Reddit, a post titled “Help, Destiny 1 server connection error leads me to the character creation screen. Characters deleted?” describes a player who only started a week ago. “I started playing Destiny 1 for the first time a week ago on my PS5, and today the game gave me an error.” Another user said , “Lost connection to servers and now I cannot find my characters. My characters are now not showing up on the sign-in screen, and it says that it cannot find my account on DIM.” Over on the Bungie forums, another user created a thread , titled “All D1 Progress has been deleted”, with the them saying: “All D1 progress has been deleted after maintenance has been concluded. When will we get our characters back?” Another Bungie.net user reported : “All my characters in Destiny 1 have been deleted after a black screen” before being dumped to character creation. A different player added , “I lost my character under similar circumstances. Does anyone have a way to contact Bungie to find out what is going on?” On top of that, some players say Destiny 1 has been brought back offline again, with the game now showing a maintenance message instead of letting them through to the title screen. That lines up with what you would expect if Bungie is trying to investigate a bad server-side change that only showed up once the game went live again. Image: Bungie.net via The Game Post Related: Footage Shows Destiny 1 Running On PC Via Emulation What happens next for deleted Destiny 1 accounts? At the time of writing, Bungie has not made any public statement that directly mentions deleted Destiny 1 accounts. The developer did put out a statement saying that Destiny 1 servers are being brought offline for emergency maintenance. So, it appears they are aware of the issue and are working on fixing it. Since this is a widespread issue that seems to be hitting a lot of Destiny 1 players at once, one possible fix could be a full rollback on Bungie’s side, restoring account data from a backup taken before today’s maintenance. We have seen Bungie do limited rollbacks and restores in Destiny 2 in the past when server issues or bugs caused major problems, so it is not out of the question here either. We also tested an older Destiny 1 profile that previously had three characters and a full history of raids and activities. In-game, that account now lands on an empty character selection screen, and the associated third-party tools no longer show any Destiny 1 data at all. We will update this story when more updates are provided by Bungie.

2025-12-16T22:38:44,"Adjustments to Enhancement Shaman, Restoration Druid, & Arms Warrior - Titan Reforged","Blizzard has announced additional adjustments coming to Enhancement Shaman, Restoration Druid, & Arms Warrior on China's Titan Reforged server. Additional Rogue Changes Buffs to Arms Warrior Following the routine server maintenance on December 18th, we will be making the following online adjustments to the talents and abilities of Enhancement Shaman, Restoration Druid, and Arms Warrior: Shaman Enhancement Lava Burst: Fixed a bug where Lava Burst could not activate Maelstrom Weapon stacks. Lava Burst can now also chain damage to up to two enemies near the target. The chain effect of Lava Burst can now also activate Maelstrom Weapon stacks. Two-handed Weapon Specialization: A new talent located to the right of Dual Wield. This talent has 3 points: When you equip a two-handed melee weapon, all your damage is increased by 2/4/6%. This damage bonus applies to all Shaman totems, summons, and spells. It also increases your chance to activate Maelstrom Weapon by 13%/27/40% and makes Maelstrom Weapon effect Lava Burst. After the above changes are implemented, all Shaman talent trees will be reset, and players can freely redistribute their talent points. Developer's message: Shamans will gain more serious damage, a smoother Lava Burst casting experience, the same speed of gaining Maelstrom Weapon stacks as one-handed weapons, and stronger area-of-effect damage capabilities without needing to stack a large amount of additional spell damage when using two-handed weapons. Sparks fly and lightning flashes—let your dance begin! Druid Restoration Rejuvenation: Will now immediately heal the target when cast. Tranquility： Healing range has been increased to 40 yards (up from 30 yards), and the cooldown has been reduced to 3 minutes (down from 8 minutes). The system will now prioritize healing the five allies with the lowest health in the squad or team, with priority given to player characters. Improved Tranquility: Redesigned. No longer reduces the cooldown of Tranquility. Now reduces the threat generated by Tranquility by 50/100%, reduces its mana cost by 10/20%, and increases the number of allies prioritized for healing by 2/5 per heal. (With 1/2 talent point invested, it prioritizes healing the 7/10 allies with the lowest health). Improved Barkskin: Barkskin can now be used on allies. Developer's message: In Elune's name, more healing power for the Druids. Warrior Arms Improved Slam: Now also increases Slam damage by 10/20% and allows it to be cast while moving.

2025-12-16T20:52:43,Blizzard Continues to Loosen Addon API Restrictions and Whitelist Select Spells,"In an update within the WoW UI Dev Discord, Blizzard has shared new plans for addon API restrictions, allowing players more control over cast bars, unit frame healing, and limited whitelisting of select spells! While some of the technical aspects only matter to addon authors, the short version is that the developers are relaxing some restrictions and giving players more tools to interact with cast bars or to predict healing and absorbs on unit frames directly. Overall, these are very good changes coming at the request of player feedback. Whitelisting Soul Fragments and Maelstrom Weapon One of the biggest updates is whitelisting specific spells, allowing addons access to track their states, charges, or cooldowns in a way that the current UI does not. A big part of this is making the number of available combat resurrections more visible for players who don't necessarily have one of those spells, with Skyriding also being added in order to make it easier for players to see how many of the shared cooldown charges are available. Among other improvements, these changes will allow addons to track Maelstrom, rather than using janky workarounds. Neither of those have much in the way of direct combat implications, though the big surprise is adding Enhancement Shaman Maelstrom Weapon and Devourer Demon Hunter Soul Fragment, both of which are very important secondary resources that lack native UI elements. While whitelisting them is a huge improvement for those spec's ability to engage with their most important resource, it also contracts Blizzard's previously stated intent to avoid addons enabling a gameplay advantage, which these almost certainly do. Although this may represent a slippery slope, enterprising players had already come up with jury-rigged solutions to replicate the same kind of power trackers that they would have previously made using addons. While we shouldn't expect this leniency to be extended to every class, spec, or spell, the developers have shown willingness to evaluate these needs on a case-by-case basis. Upcoming Addon API Changes via WoWUIDev Discord Blizzard again! Below you will find a list of changes we are making to addon restriction APIs in the coming weeks. These are not the entirety of the changes we are planning, just the ones already committed to for the immediately upcoming Beta releases. NOTE: Beta 5 will be the last Beta build we put out this year. We will be continuing to work on addon dev requests until the holidays but Beta 6 won't be made until January. Also note that Beta 4 had more changes than expected, and Beta 5 has fewer due to build timing (Beta 4 ended up being built later than expected). REMINDER: Beta builds have switched to a 12.0.1 version number instead of 12.0.0. This is because 12.0.0 will be the version used for Midnight pre-patch, and 12.0.1 will be the version used for actual Midnight launch. The remainder of Beta will feature 12.0.1 builds, while PTR (when it goes up) will feature 12.0.0 builds. We will continue to make addon-related changes in 12.0.0 until we make our pre-patch Release Candidate (RC) build. One important thing to note here is that we DO plan to have these new addon restrictions active in pre-patch (12.0.0), rather than waiting until 12.0.1. The reason for this is we want to give players a chance to get used to the new addon landscape prior to Midnight launch. We are not in 12.0.0 RC yet, so you can continue to test in Beta for now, but once we pick an RC build (we will let you know when that happens) we advise addon authors looking to prepare for pre-patch switch to testing on PTR instead of Beta. After the 12.0.0 RC is chosen, our engineers will be switching over to making most addon-related changes in 12.0.1 (outside of very high priority stuff). We will continue to make changes to 12.0.1 all the way up until launch (and well past launch even, in follow-up patches) to provide you with more of the QoL changes you have requested. Coming in Beta 5 (ETA 12/17) UnitFrame Heal Absorb & Heal Prediction We have added a new UnitHealPredictionCalculator Lua object (created via a new CreateUnitHealPredictionCalculator API), and an associated API UnitGetDetailedHealPrediction that accepts this object type. Addons can use these APIs to calculate all of the heal prediction and absorb data needed for passing directly into other APIs. This object provides various options, such as allowing for damage absorbs to be clamped to either missing health, missing health after adding incoming healing, or maximum health. Very brief example shown below: local calculator = CreateUnitHealPredictionCalculator(); UnitGetDetailedHealPrediction(unit, unitDoingTheHealing, calculator); -- 'calculator' is updated with new data after this call. local incomingHeals, incomingHealsFromHealer, incomingHealsFromOthers, incomingHealsClamped = calculator:GetIncomingHeals(); myStatusBar:SetValue(incomingHealsFromHealer); Cast Bars Added a new optional direction parameter to `StatusBar:SetTimerDuration` that allows the status bar to calculate its fill from remaining duration rather than elapsed (for channeled spells primarily). Party Kill Event Added a new `PARTY_KILL` event that gets sent when a party member kills a unit. The payload is 2 unitGUIDs, the attacker and target. Both are secret when the associated unit's identity is secret. Currently being worked on Whitelisting Select Spells Adding numerous spells to the whitelists for cooldown/aura secrecy: Skyriding spells, the GCD spell, Maelstrom Weapon, Devourer DH resource spells, Combat Res spells. Continue to call out spells that you think should be whitelisted, we will evaluate each of them individually. Removing Old Duration APIs We are removing several APIs (in C_UnitAuras, C_Spell and C_ActionBar) that are no longer needed now that Duration objects are a thing. Generic Boolean To Color APIs We are adding 2 new APIs (C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorFromBoolean and C_CurveUtil.EvaluateColorValueFromBoolean) that can be used to convert a secret boolean to a color. This is in preference to adding SetStatusBarColorFromBoolean, SetColorTextureFromBoolean, etc. Lots More Cast Bar Stuff We are adding a new castbar spell sequence ID delivered with spellcast events and from the UnitCastingInfo/UnitChannelInfo APIs. This sequence ID is only delivered for casting events that should display a castbar in the UI, is incremented on each new spellcast, and is never secret. We will be removing secret restrictions on several values needed by addons to properly display enemy empowered casts (number of stages and the percentage of cast time each stage consumes). We will be adding a way to include the hold-at-max time of empowered casts in a duration object. Formatting Secret Times We are adding a new SecondsFormatter Lua object that will allow addons to format secret time values into strings. Other numeric formatting solutions are also being worked on, including a solution for formatting differences between cast durations (eg. for spell pushback). Restricted Environment Issues Several functions (strsplit, strjoin, strconcat) that got mistakenly removed from the restricted environment are being added back. Reload UI & Secrets We are fixing an issue where secret values are made non-secret following a UI reload.",2025-12-17T11:45:55.361061,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379691/blizzard-continues-to-loosen-addon-api-restrictions-and-whitelist-select-spells,cf91322730368076c6c073631e53a6d19bc045a4,1645,en,0.1,"In an update within the WoW UI Dev Discord, Blizzard has shared new plans for addon API restrictions, allowing players more control over cast bars, unit frame healing, and limited ",other,0.25

2025-12-16T19:45:59,Records Shattered in WoW Classic with Naxxramas Cleared Under 40 Minutes by <Eternal>!,"Wowhead had the pleasure of sitting down with Maddux, leader of the guild <Eternal>, after they completed Naxxramas in an incredible 38:24! In our conversation, we go over the preparation of a Naxxramas speed run and how these players manage to clear the entire necropolis in under forty minutes! Naxxramas Raid Overview Guide Hey Maddux, first of all, a big congratulations on not only a sub 40 Naxx clear, but currently the fastest 40-man Naxxrammas clear ever! How did that record-breaking run feel? Thanks - While beating the current record feels great, we still have a month left, so it's far from over. Our competition is fully capable of beating our current time, so our first thoughts after a run are always on what went wrong or how we can improve things. Looking at the WCL entry, are there any PoVs you'd recommend people watch? We have a lot of great points of view on our speed runs. Our warriors like Camelllia and Atd provide great views of our speed runs. What spots do you really feel are the ""make or break"" moments of increasing your timers? How do y'all handle those moments? There are definitely a few high-risk points in the run. In Spider Wing, we have a Paladin and a Rogue using a flask of petrification to help skip large amounts of trash mobs. If either of these guys fails their setup, the run is effectively over. Another spot that's very volatile is the Sapphiron polarity strat. This involves taking the polarity damage buff from Thaddius into Sapphiron, then killing the boss in under 20 seconds. It's very possible for a bad blizzard cast to take out a few players, which can snowball into a large time loss for Kel'Thuzad. For people who don't speed run, can you walk us through what the preparation looks like? When do y'all start preparing for the next run, and what goes on from when 1 lockout is done to the next? The preparation for speedrunning starts with gathering full world buffs. This go-around is much easier than back in 2019, since we have chronoboons from the start. Next, we have a pretty extensive list of consumables needed for a Naxx speedrun that we need to make sure are ready. Then, before we can actually start the run, we need to mind vision to scout certain mob types and set up some patrols to line up properly for our start. Will Eternal continue to speed run in TBC Anniversary? Eternal will continue speedrunning in TBC.

2025-12-16T16:07:30,Hidden Achievement Hints at One Final Phase of Legion Remix,"Hinted at by a hidden achievement, one final phase of Legion Remix may be coming soon allowing players to bid farewell to this beloved event in an epic and chaotic finale. Legion Remix OverviewLegion Remix: Rewards Cloudy With a Chance of Infernals Legion Remix Finale Collected all the appearances and achieved all your goals in Legion Remix? Well they may still be one more thing left to do, but it's as of yet still unobtainable; acquiring the hidden achievement Cloudy With a Chance of Infernals. While initially speculated to be awarded with the Infinite Echoes update or as part of the Lost Legion Infernals Event, the hidden achievement did not complete upon login suggesting we might not have seen the final bit of Legion Remix content. So what might we expect from a finale event? The achievement itself is a reference to the 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' children's book that was later adapted into a series of movies. In the story, food-related weather, like meatballs instead of rain, lead to some destructive natural disasters. So for Legion Remix, the answer is simple expect Infernals to rain from the skies. Conveniently, the latest Infinite Echoes update added an ominous temporal vortex in the skies above Dalaran, the perfect location from which Infernals could rain from above. The infinite dragonflight NPCs below even suggest that the unstable vortex spells likely spells the end for the remix timeline. Similar send-off events have occurred typically in the final days of WoW expansion Beta tests. Notably at the end of the Classic Beta, developers swarmed Stormwind with Infernals and even had Ragnaros, Hogger, and Onyxia fight to the death. The shenanigans can be quite entertaining and we can only hope for a similar level of antics at the end of Legion Remix on or before its end on January 19th. Check below for some footage of the Classic Beta finale event by ChiodoGaming. Do you enjoy these types of send-off events? What do you hope to see for the finale of Legion Remix?",2025-12-17T11:45:55.375445,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379671/hidden-achievement-hints-at-one-final-phase-of-legion-remix,ee7781d2a1808873585086f06d7b7462d3258665,1652,en,0.1,"Hinted at by a hidden achievement, one final phase of Legion Remix may be coming soon allowing players to bid farewell to this beloved event in an epic and chaotic finale.

2025-12-16T12:14:00,Back to Normality - TWW Season 3 Mythic+ Rankings Week 18,"After the excitement from next week, this week is back to normality, without any record-breaking pushes. Raider.IO TWW Season 3 Dungeon Statistics Spec Popularity in Mythic+ for TWW Season 3 - Week of December 9th With the highest key being back, not a lot of changes are seen in popularity with the meta spec of Frost DK, BM Hunter, Havoc DH, Prot Warrior, and Resto Druid still comprising most of the player base, with Elemental and Resto Shaman trying to sneak into top-tier compositions. Depletion Rates for Season 3 Keys - Week of December 9th Without any changes, depletion rates continue to be stable across the board, with Ara-Kara boasting over 20% depletion rate. Key Level Distribution in Season 3 - Week of December 9th The gap between +10 and +12 keys continues to drop, with most players being done with their Keystone Legend achievements, and most only doing +10s to fill in their weekly Vault slot. Mythic+ Participation per Week in Season 3 While reducing, the number of keys stays somewhat stable when compared to last week, staying around 400k keys completed. Legion Remix Disclaimers and Source Data for this article is sourced from Raider.io statistics for Mythic+ dungeon participation, collected during the week of December 9th. Data encapsulates all key levels, looking to paint a complete picture of what the M+ community is doing during the period. Note that, since the data reflect only participation, there are many implicit biases in the numbers. Since all metrics shown deal with popularity, they aren't directly attached to spec balance, but to community perception of spec balance. Specs considered bad by the community will generally be played less and tend to have lower participation. Highest keys tend to have a very low participation, meaning specs played by these players will be overrepresented, despite any actual balance.

2025-12-16T07:14:05,Has The Light Forsaken Them? - The War Within Season 3 DPS Rankings for Mythic Manaforge Omega Week 18,"This week, we will be looking through the Manaforge Omega journey for Arcane Mages and Retribution Paladins, continuing our journey through specs in Season 3. Manaforge Omega Statistics Page Manaforge Omega Raid Tier Lists Looking for more insight into the raid balance? Check out our Tier Lists, which include more information besides pure throughput for Manaforge Omega. DPS Tier List Healer Tier List Tank Tier List The War Within Season 3 DPS Rankings To start our look back into Season 3, we will be looking at Arcane and Retribution. Arcane had a comfy run in Manaforge Omega, being in the first quartile of rankings for the whole tier. You could say that its only regret this tier was never able to reach the #1 spot, always filled by Elemental Shaman or Marksmanship Hunters. In the other end of the spectrum, we have Retribution. After a great run in Liberation of Undermine, Manaforge had a rough start for rets. Starting the tier in the last spot, then briefly climbing all the way to the #7 spot, Paladins were hopeful to repeat their performance, but the gains were short-lived. Shortly after Ret dropped back to the lower quartile, where it struggled to get out of the whole tier, bouncing between the 15th and 20th position. We've invited our writers for the two specs to contextualize their journeys better, and you can read them below, after the rankings. For Rankings, without any new tuning or changes, all changes below are just noise changes, with specs that are close enough balance-wise, just swapping positions. 95th Percentile Statistics Overall Damage Damage to Bosses Overall Statistics Overall Damage Damage to Bosses PositionSpec and ClassPopulation SizeChange from Last Week 1Marksmanship Hunter2885↑1 2Elemental Shaman15102↓1 3Arcane Mage180590 4Assassination Rogue61750 5Beast Mastery Hunter314590 6Fury Warrior17370↑2 7Destruction Warlock23460↓1 8Frost Death Knight24955↓1 9Subtlety Rogue3115↑5 10Augmentation Evoker31200 11Unholy Death Knight2616↑1 12Fire Mage1892↓3 13Balance Druid11083↓2 14Windwalker Monk4861↓1 15Shadow Priest80850 16Devastation Evoker67770 17Havoc Demon Hunter17742↑1 18Retribution Paladin19112↑2 19Feral Druid25960 20Affliction Warlock1036↑1 21Demonology Warlock2508↓4 22Survival Hunter7980 23Arms Warrior814↑1 24Enhancement Shaman1523↓1 25Outlaw Rogue894↑1 26Frost Mage4795↓1 Class Writer Commentary To help us better understand the charts above, we invited our Class Writers for Arcane Mage and Retribution Paladin to provide insights about the journey their specs had in Manaforge Omega. Arcane Mage Porom Arcane started off strong and is looking to finish strong in Manaforge Omega. Due to good spec design which leveraged big burst from Arcane Surge and heavy funnel from Resonance, Arcane was able to be a solid role-player on the fights that mattered most this season, Nexus-King Salhadaar and Dimensius. Both of these fights had critical timings that, due in large part to Shifting Power reducing our major cooldowns to 80 seconds, we were able to rise to the occasion on. I have spoken repeatedly about how good Arcane's damage profile is in The War Within for usefulness and we saw this on display in the last few seasons. Arcane even got hit with nerfs this season, taking a 3% hit a couple of months ago, but despite that Arcane continues to do well. It cannot also be stated enough that a lot of Arcane's success this season was attributed to favorable tuning from the start. Most specs in WoW, despite how useful or not, tend to rely on tuning for relevance, with an occasional spurious factor, like cleave radi being bad due to boss hitboxes. A good damage profile can mitigate these factors to a degree, but ultimately if you aren't tuned well, it becomes an uphill battle very quickly. Arcane Mage is the perfect storm of a strong damage profile and solid tuning. Overall, the strengths of burst, funnel, and execute paired with cooldown flexibility have led to success for Arcane since the Dragonflight talent tree was introduced; however, with most of these being removed or severely weakened in Midnight, it is very likely that Arcane will depend much more on tuning in the future. Retribution Paladin Bolas Retribution has settled into occupying its normal positioning in DPS rankings - solidly below average, but not bad enough to get meaningful buffs. Ret started out this tier underperforming significantly, due to poor management of the buffs/nerfs received at the beginning of the patch to Divine Hammer and a below average tier set bonus. It received some justified buffs shortly after the launch of the raid, but has sat relatively untouched since then, in solid mediocrity. For the encounters in Manaforge Omega itself, many of the challenging encounters have important windows for increased damage, like Forgeweaver Araz, Nexus-King Salhadaar, and Dimensius. Ret's current design doesn't really have any options for optimizing damage for these windows. The spec has burst damage, but it's concentrated in only a couple of globals (Wake of Ashes and Hammer of Light) and its burst windows are strictly every 30s. This means that for Ret, although it can do solid consistent damage and has good options for AoE burst for regular add spawns, it really struggled to contribute on fights where the damage amps are a priority. This is entirely a design/tuning issue, since the options that it has for longer cooldowns are extremely undertuned. Disclaimers and Source The data for this article was taken from the Raid Statistics Page on Warcraft Logs for Mythic difficulty during the week of December 2nd. Overall, the numbers shown above represent data for the 95th percentile. For charts, we also included data for all percentiles and boss damage to better represent the current state of balance. The data presented, however, isn't free of bias, as it is representative of the current meta of the game, which, in itself, is biased by community perception of specs. This bias comes from players generally flocking to specs perceived as ""better"", be it either easier to play or dealing more damage, or a combination of both. The other side of the coin is specs that are too hard to play or too weak will be underrepresented and appear lower than they actually are. Competitive players will generally prefer specs perceived to do more damage, making the best specs appear higher than they actually are. While not as prevalent in modern days, strategy differences and parse-funneling may impact rankings. Specs that excel in AoE, spread cleave, or burst windows will appear higher in the total charts.",2025-12-17T11:45:55.378420,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379674/has-the-light-forsaken-them-the-war-within-season-3-dps-rankings-for-mythic,ee0b68326fbb7627cd7a43b9fab604c53cbbd690,1655,en,0.1,"This week, we will be looking through the Manaforge Omega journey for Arcane Mages and Retribution Paladins, continuing our journey through specs in Season 3.

With major system and itemization updates to new endgame features that the community has been clamoring for since the release of Diablo 4, there is something in the expansion for everyone. Of course, the expansion also includes two new classes, one of which is the Paladin that can be played now with a pre-order of the expansion. Paladin Overview Season 11 Overview Diablo 4 Lord of Hatred Expansion Details Lord of Hatred brings a lot of changes and new content to the game in various forms, and the infographic has everything coming with the expansion categorized into short snippets. There's also a mini-roadmap included with the post. Diablo 4 Lord of Hatred Expansion Overview Content As is expected with a new Expansion, there is a new campaign to go through, an increase in the maximum level, a new region, and two new classes. Players are still debating what the second class might be, with some thinking it could be the return of Diablo 3's Witch Doctor, or an Amazon class, since those line up with the lore of the ancient Skovos region. System Updates Lord of Hatred is bringing plenty of new updates to important game systems. The skill tree has undergone big changes, with expanded functionality on a lot of skills, increased skill ranks, and more! On top of that, Diablo 4 is seeing the return of franchise-favorites in both the Horadric Cube and the Talisman system, which will reintroduce set bonuses. New Endgame Features The Endgame is also seeing big changes with Lord of Hatred, ranging from new features such as Warplans to focus on certain content more heavily, or the new Echoing Hatred system that will challenge players in an endless gauntlet.

We've prepared a list with the best Bronze sources in the Broken Isles to ensure you finish your checklists before the timeways return to normal. Legion Remix Rewards Sentinax Farms The most efficient Bronze per hour farm since it came out, Sentinax farms are excellent choices if all you're looking for is raw Bronze. With a good group, you can achieve over 100k Bronze per hour and a lot of Infinite Power. For that, look for groups farming Sentinax in the group finder, usually listed under raids. Note that this method can be very boring and repetitive, but the numbers make it enticing. Daily Raid Clears One of the best ways to farm Bronze is to raid. Since the recent hotfixes, every raid boss, regardless of difficulty, will award you with 2500 Bronze. Nighthold, Tomb of Sargeras, and Antorus all have over 10 bosses each, meaning each raid completion will net you way over 20k Bronze. This is probably the best method if you're still looking to gear up as well. One-Time Rewards As is tradition with Remix, everything awards Bronze. If you still have goals to complete, like achievements or finishing campaigns, focus on finishing those before grinding for Bronze, as you will, more likely than not, farm enough Bronze for whatever cosmetic you're looking for while completing those. Non-account-wide achievements like completing dungeons and raids will also grant bronze to every character you complete them on, meaning you can earn a lot of Bronze by running these dungeons and raids on alts at least once for completion as well. You can always ask a friend to help carry your alts. Daily Activities Bronze rewards from daily activities got buffed considerably in a recent hotfix. If you're still gearing a character or enjoy running raids, emissaries, world bosses, and assaults, completing those is a very good source of Bronze now. Their only downside is the daily limitation, meaning you have a cap on how much Bronze you can earn per day. If you're not in a rush, this is a great choice.",2025-12-17T11:45:55.382390,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379663/best-ways-to-farm-bronze-in-legion-remix-wrap-up-your-collection,0feffa7e90e505678ce67977a8e82b8ec93fc63d,1658,en,0.1,Looking for more Bronze to finish your Legion Remix collectibles?

2025-12-15T16:26:05,Defend the Broken Isles Faster to Earn Legion Remix Achievements and Decor,"With demonic invasions spaced out every few hours, Defending the Broken Isles can take quite a long time, but players can earn these Legion Remix achievements in just one sitting using a simple trick! Although Blizzard just pushed a hotfix to cycle Legion Assaults significantly faster, completing 10 events would still normally take three to four days. However, the achievement increments each time the scenario's objectives are completed, rather than when the quest is turned in. This means that players can speed up the process by repeatedly abandoning the Assault quest and then re-accepting it to queue for another scenario. Find an active assault. Complete the four world quests and initial chain. Start the final assault scenario: Battle for Azsuna, Battle for Val'sharah, Battle for Highmountain, or Battle for Stormheim. Complete all steps up to the final objective (Get Out of There, Time to go, or Escape!), in which the quest is marked completed. Instead of taking the mount out, simply leave the group and abandon the quest without turning it in. Re-accept the quest, and queue again. A bit tedious perhaps, but sped up even more by the fact that Legion Assaults no longer require a group, meaning the achievement can be quite comfortably finished in no time even while completely solo! Be sure to check the achievement tracker for credit before leaving the scenario! Finishing all 10 assaults awards a Vertical Felsteel Chain and unlocks the Hanging Felsteel Chain for purchase from the Legion Remix housing vendor. Along the way, you can also complete the Defending Broken Isles portion of the Legionfall campaign, as well as Defending the Broken Isles I and II for a little bit of knowledge.",2025-12-17T11:45:55.386358,,Wowhead News,https://www.wowhead.com/news=379660/defend-the-broken-isles-faster-to-earn-legion-remix-achievements-and-decor,18ceb19ee94bb360d1f37d017808b7954ad217db,1663,en,0.1,"With demonic invasions spaced out every few hours, Defending the Broken Isles can take quite a long time, but players can earn these Legion Remix achievements in just one sitting u",other,0.25

2025-12-14T22:56:54,What Do the Old Gods Really Want? - Nobbel87,"The title says it all! What on Azeroth DO the Old Gods really want? Lucky for us, Nobbel87 is here to tell us... Transcript: Hello everyone! I’ve been asked to do a video on what the Old Gods really want. You know, besides the whole “absorb and control everything”—but then what? Like... just to have it? And it’s a good question—not just what do the Old Gods want, but what about the Void Lords, the source behind them? What about the void in general because, well, some storytelling has been going on in the lore lately. The story of the Old Gods is one of the older ones that we got in the history of warcraft, going as far back as the early 2000s, with Warcraft 3 and the Warcraft RPG. An evil force defeated by the noble Titans, locked away beneath the world as the Titans brought order to the planet, cut out the rivers and formed the mountains, with the corruptive influence of the Old Gods neatly locked away. The elemental lords dissipated, although later were sent to their own elemental plane. Sometimes there were 4 Old Gods, sometimes 3, sometimes 5, and then we got the chronicles, 2016, nearly 10 years ago (jfc), which gives us the most expanded description of what happened, but even that is no longer set in stone. Here’s what it says though: The Old Gods are physical manifestations of the Void. They are nightmares incarnate: mountains of blighted flesh and writhing tentacles that grow like cancers within the world of the Great Dark. These malignant entities serve the Void Lords, and they live only to transform the worlds they infest into places of despair and death. From the moment the cosmos came to be, dark spirits within the Void sought to twist reality into a realm of eternal torment. These entities were known as the Void Lords, and they had long watched the Pantheon and their journey from world to world. Envious of their power, the Void Lords sought to corrupt one of the world-shaping Titans into an instrument of their will. To achieve this goal, the Void Lords struggled to manifest in the physical universe. As they did so, their energies seeped into reality, warping some of the unsuspecting denizens of creation. Yet the noble and virtuous Titans proved impervious to this insidious corruption. Eventually the Void Lords moved to exert their influence over a Titan in its most vulnerable state: before it had awakened. The Void Lords did not know which worlds contained slumbering Titan spirits. Thus, they pooled their power and hurled dark creatures throughout the physical universe, hoping some would smash into a world-soul. An unknown number of the Void Lords’ creations hurtled through the Great Dark. They contaminated mortal worlds and everything else they touched in their blind search for a nascent Titan. In time, these wicked beings would come to be known as the Old Gods. Although the Titans were aware that Void energies existed in the universe, they had no knowledge of the Void Lords or the Old Gods, but that would change when Sargeras came across a planet infected by the Old Gods, which also housed a slumbering world soul. The dreadlords on the planet told him all about what they’d found out about the Void, how they wanted to corrupt the Titans, get their tentacles into a soul. If the power of the Void succeeded in corrupting a nascent Titan, it would awaken as an unspeakably dark creature. No power in creation, not even the pantheon, could stand against it. In time, the warped Titan would consume all matter and energy in the universe, bringing every mote of existence under the Void Lords’will. Sargeras, the undefeated champion of the Titans, knew fear for the first time, and this would be the kick off point—the reason for him to form the Burning Legion and start his Burning Crusade. The chronicle this information is from is turning almost 10—10 years old with brand new writers, narrative leads, new visions, new quests and expansions. In general, Steve Danuser made the statement that the chronicles are from a point of view and since then, pretty much all books produced have been from a point of view. Regardless of opinions on this choice, we still use the chronicles as a baseline, as a foundation, but then all this information provided about the Old Gods being created by the Void Lords and the Void Lords being all about consuming the universe, it has lore bits that support it and lore bits that put down some major question marks. “Serve me.” “You? You are nothing.” “Nothing? I AM A GOD! Before you walked this land, I ruled.” “Uhng...Magnificent.” We know for certain that there was a time in which the Old Gods ruled the world of Azeroth, the so-called Black Empire, as we’ve seen this in the Azshara short. We’ve traveled through time and ended up in that time period. There was a time in which the Old Gods were ruling the planet, but what were they up to? Were they corrupting that soul inside until the Titans showed up? It does seem to be that way, as we have Magni confirming to us that... “Today at long last, she’s free from the grasp of the Old Gods. Her song rings clear and strong throughout this chamber.” N’zoth and the other Old Gods have been kicked off the planet, reaffirmed with the war within presentation in which they’ve told us that the Old Gods are gone and their blood is that which remains. Which then played a part in the expansion itself. Blood of the Old gods who definitely set their sights on that world soul, as shown with the Xal’atath lorewalking... “You shall only watch this world as it gains untold power without you. You shall never lay claim to it.” “The world soul so long denied me...shall...be... mine.” And we do have story supporting the idea that the Void’s ultimate goal is to devour the entire universe. Velen once had a vision when gazing upon Anduin, a vision of Renilash Void vs Light, and he describes it as: It was vast and empty and swallowed all light that entered it. Velen knew it would be all consuming until, at last, it would turn and devour itself, endlessly gnawing on nothing in the Great Dark Beyond, removing all meaning from the universe, from the most heart-breaking sonata to the most arresting sunset. It was too terrible to see, to comprehend, and yet the army headed straight for it. And the light began to fade... So that’s what the Old Gods are all about: sent out by the Void Lords to corrupt a slumbering Titan spirit, for it to awaken and devour the universe. It fits—pieces are all together—we saved Azeroth and saved the day. But then there is the story of K’aresh, and that’s where a bit of this new storytelling comes in, because they’ve made a small change to the lore which has a bit of a domino effect. They’ve written down that K’aresh, like Azeroth, has a world soul inside. In the past, that detail wasn’t known, so when in the original story, Dimensius the All-Devouring, a Void Lord, did his thing and tried to devour K’aresh, no big deal. A planet might be delicious for a Void Lord, but now there’s a world soul inside and we were told that the Void Lords are all about corrupting these slumbering world souls—not eating them—so what’s up? I think it’s an oversight, a small change to the story which they made to mirror K’aresh to Azeroth as in this was a world with a world soul inside that had to deal with the powers of Dimensius and look what happened to it. That fate is now looming over Azeroth with Xal’atath, best go protect the planet, but it doesn’t flow well with the earlier established story. You could explain it by saying that not all the Void Lords are on the same page. Some might be down with this corrupting plan, some are more hungry and want to eat themselves. Maybe Dimensius ate all the other Void Lords and that’s why he’s the last one standing. But that explanation has not been given, so we’re left to our own devices to fill it in. “I will devour your world!” And what about the Old Gods corrupting these slumbering world souls? As you might remember, Sargeras was informed by the Dreadlords that is what the Old Gods wanted, yet with the Shadowlands, they’ve added a book called Enemy Infiltration - Preface, and in that book, they make mention of the Dreadlords actually coming from the Shadowlands and the Dreadlords being all about infiltrating these cosmic domains, manipulating things from within and pitching them against one another—point being that the Dreadlords are not exactly the most trustworthy of sources. Now, there is a bit of meta storytelling here to consider. Do we really want Sargeras’ whole motivation to be based on a lie? But that’s neither here nor there. Just throwing it out there that there is the potential that the Dreadlords were lying to him. But then, what about our Old Gods? Because we know that there are more planets out there with Old Gods on them. Presumably we got lucky and those planets don’t have a world soul inside. They’ve described Azeroth as the last one, so maybe Sargeras’ Burning Crusade did the job or the Old Gods just misfired on empty planets, but they should still be out there. Even though they don’t have a soul to corrupt, they’re still hanging out on the planets, in the same vein that we had Old Gods hanging out on our planet doing more than just burrowing their tendrils into Azeroth. They reveled in chaos, pitching the enslaved elemental lords against each other, reveling in the destruction and madness that overwhelmed the world. Looking back at Battle for Azeroth, with N’zoth pushing into the vale and Uldum, is a good indicator for the madness of the times, but they weren’t mindless chaos machines bent on nothing but devouring and corrupting. Sure, that was a big part of it, but when pushed, we’d see them work together and working on their own plans... “N’zoth should have known Xal’atath would target Ny’alotha when she learned what he had been building. Our aid will leave him in our debt.” “Xal’atath underestimates us. Her attempts to distract us have failed. Even we will work together when faced with such blatant betrayal.” “Xal’atath! You betrayed not only the strength of the Black Empire, but the very darkness that embraced you. As punishment for your craven selfishness, you will suffer in confinement.” Unsure what N’zoth was building, some have suggested the Blade of the Black Empire itself, but it is not set in stone what he was working on, which pushed Xal’atath to betray the Old Gods, as they’d describe it. Point being, they were working on their own plans besides just corrupting the world soul, and when provided with an opportunity... “But that was not all Xal’atath said. The tablet states she whispered in a voice only N’zoth could hear...” “Consider what greatness could be yours, if your siblings did not stand in your way. The offer stands. You need only reach out and claim it.” “Hear me, God of the Deep! I have brought you the Opener... the Bringer of Truths...the Torch That Lights the Way! Honor our bargain, free me to find my own fate.” “Go...but the blade must remain...to serve my will.” “A fair exchange. Shadows guide you, my dear friend. We will meet again. I am certain of it.” It is no coincidence that the old god N’zoth, the weakest of the lot, would be the one to break out of his prison. How could he not, with a Xal’atath in his corner? Where she was released from the blade, he was released from the Titans bonds, only to be taken out by us. A win-win for Xal’atath, who could then push on with her own plans and once again set her sights on claiming that world soul. Perhaps not as the Old Gods did. Perhaps more in the direction of what the Titans or the jailer wanted her for—the power to reshape the universe in their image—although part of me kinda hopes that Xal’atath is the one that just wants to set Azeroth free. I would be somewhat disappointed if Xal’atath just wants to eat her or use her for the ultimate powers of the Void, but that part is to be revealed. So, long story short, what did the Old Gods really want? They wanted, as far as we know, to corrupt a slumbering world soul so that it would devour the entirety of the universe. The Void would be the dominating force, and while working on that, they definitely played their own games and schemes. With that, we’re going to wrap up, so thank you very much for watching everyone!

Remember that the upgrade tracks are changing in Midnight, as well as how crests work. Check out this article for more information. Please note that this is available in Beta, and confirmed by datamining, but it has not been officially announced by Blizzard. This may be changed at any time as this is a Beta. Midnight Season 1 Mythic+ Rewards from Great Vault In Midnight, the Great Vault track has been extended and will now scale past +10s, all the way up to +18s, where players will get Myth 4/6 loot. The first part of the track is no different than War Within, and the only change is for player who want to push past +10 keystones. This is great news for Mythic+ players as they will no longer get a low Myth 1/6 by completing the highest keys.

If this extended track is available right away in Midnight, you might want to push for +12s week 1 to get a Myth 2/6 piece. Or if you're an extremely skilled Mythic+ player, maybe you'll want to push for Myth 3/6 the first week to save even more crests. Don't forget that the crest upgrade system is changing in Midnight, so the higher you push, you'll save more and more crests. For people that only do +10s? There's no change. For people that want to push a little further now into +12s, there's a little more incentive to do so and I think this may get more people into higher keystones. What do you think of this change?

Boasting two builds in S-tier, Barbarians might finally have the strength to compete with everyone else. Paladin remains a big question mark around Season 11. Builds are being theorycrafted, content is being cleared, and the best players are already on the hunt to optimize their gear and skills for the challenges ahead. Will Paladin make its mark and crush the competition? It remains to be seen!

2025-12-17T11:43:00,Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon – Sanctuary of Sarras Review – An Excellent Addition,"W hen Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon got its 1.0 release earlier this year, our own review regarded it as a pretty good game that, while having some rough edges, made up for it thanks to its fantastic world-building, intricate lore, and generally fun setting. This setting has now seen a surprisingly well-thought-out expansion with the new Sanctuary of Sarras DLC. Sanctuary of Sarras doesn’t dramatically change how The Fall of Avalon plays, but it’s a strong expansion where it counts: story, atmosphere and lore. Spoiler warning: this review discusses major base-game story details. While the base game focused quite a bit on the classic Arthurian legend and twisting it into a dark reflection of itself, the DLC adds a surprising amount of extra detail that makes it fun to delve further into all the history that you can find through side quests, random conversations, books and item descriptions you might find along the way. Sanctuary of Sarras manages to accomplish the rare feat of actually making the story of the base game better just by existing. "" Sanctuary of Sarras manages to accomplish the rare feat of actually making the story of the base game better just by existing."" The core premise behind Sanctuary of Sarras revolves around a group that decides that Avalon under Arthur’s rule was turning out to be a little too hellish for their tastes, wants to return to what they call the “homeland” – a place far away from Avalon. This group was led by Merlin’s apprentice Nimue, and as you might expect, Arthur was incredibly displeased about this would-be rebellion happening under his rule. While he ultimately decided that he should let this group try and find their way to the homeland, and likely die trying, Merlin decided to take things a step further and sank the entire fleet while still cursing them with magic that kept them alive. This would ultimately lead to the creation of an entirely new kingdom forming underwater – the realm of Sarras, named after the ship leading the group. The story itself ties into that of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon ; you, along with Arthur, end up in the ocean after getting mysterious hints from a stranger telling you that the ocean’s depths hold important secrets to uncover. On getting there, you start peeling back layers of not only the story of the ship Sarras and how its sinking led to the formation of the realm of Sarras itself, but also more details about what Avalon was like under Arthur’s and Merlin’s rule in the fallout after the Red Death. In many ways, the central story of Sanctuary of Sarras is self-contained, with you never really leaving the underwater realm over the course of its runtime. However, the fact that it ties in so well with the base game is what makes the story especially interesting, since you also get to hear Arthur’s own thoughts about Sarras and its denizens. ""The core premise behind Sanctuary of Sarras revolves around a group that decides that Avalon under Arthur’s rule was turning out to be a little too hellish for their tastes"" Mechanically, Sanctuary of Sarras only really has one major addition to the game: a new progression system that revolves around exploring the world and finding a new passive skill tree that gives you some added bonuses to make your time in the DLC easier. Generally speaking, enemies in the DLC scale in power alongside your own level. This means that one of the best ways to get stronger than them is by getting the various buffs offered by the new skill trees, which are split across three distinct branches: Warrior, Rogue and Mystic. The bonuses are just passive ones, like letting you do more damage. They do affect your playstyle, however, since there are plenty of choices to specialise further in your preferred playstyle by, for example, getting damage bonuses according to the weight of your armour in the Warrior tree, or by applying damage-multiplying debuffs in the Rogue tree that encourages faster attack speeds. You can switch your tree at any time, which makes experimenting painless. If you’re bored of playing an archer, for example, you can just equip the right bits of gear and switch to a magic using playstyle, while also getting power ups courtesy of the Mystic tree. When it comes to core gameplay design, Sarras is quite an interesting place. Rather than being open for free roam like the base game, the DLC’s zone is instead separated into distinct underwater islands with access to other islands being blocked off by gates with guardian fish spirits protecting them. Each one of these islands is fairly small on its own, and as a whole, the map is smaller than what you would see from the base game. While this might sound like a letdown in theory, in practice, the relatively smaller zones throughout the map ensure that you’re never really running around for too long without something interesting happening nearby. ""Each one of these islands is fairly small on its own, and as a whole, the map is smaller than what you would see from the base game."" Eventually, however, you will want to travel to the other parts of Sarras, and to do this, you must convince the sea creature guardians – referred to as Maws of various things, like Maw of the Current or Maw of the Tide, for example – to let you use the gates to travel to other “islands”. Each one of the Maws tends to have a different request that you must fulfill before you are allowed entry through the gate. These requests can range from fighting off nearby enemies, to having a philosophical discussion about the nature of a dictatorship, to even cooking a specific food. Once you’ve completed the request, however, the gate is free to use at your leisure to travel back and forth across the various parts of the DLC’s map. The DLC’s other major strength lies in its side quests. While there’s an excellent main quest to follow, with some downright fantastic writing that makes the whole world of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon more interesting, the side quests go a step further in giving you a glimpse into how this underwater realm survives. Just about every quest goes into some aspect, be it how humans mutated into hybrid ocean creatures, or how they established relationships with other sea creatures, and in some cases, even what their day-to-day life means in their present form. Enemy design is also quite interesting, both in terms of visual design as well as their behaviour. Visually, the enemies fulfil just about every undersea creature you can think of, ranging from tentacled beasts to barnacle-crusted zombies, fish people, serpents, and everything in between. In fights, they tend to behave how you might expect them to; the more serpentine enemies, for instance, will tend to focus on hit-and-run tactics that let them take advantage of their agility. Zombies, on the other hand, don’t use much in the way of tactics aside from trying to swarm you. ""Enemy design is also quite interesting, both in terms of visual design as well as their behaviour."" Boss fights also don’t really get particularly complex, with most of them revolving around you hanging back for a few seconds to wait for an opening to take advantage of. Some of the bosses are slower, which tends to favour builds that focus on ranged attacks like bows or magic. Others will be faster, with moves that let them close the distance quite fast, which favours builds that either focus on heavy armour or dodging. While you’re not going to get intricate puzzle bosses in Sanctuary of Sarras , the bosses still end up leaving a lasting impact because of their visual design. Most of these new enemies and bosses can be found in the many new dungeons you can find all over the new map. Generally speaking, only some of these dungeons tend to offer anything more interesting than groups of enemies to fight in your quest for epic loot. A few, however, can offer up more interesting encounters; these tend to be tied to side quests as part of a larger narrative, and can provide some unique chances to have a conversation with, for example, a pair of particularly intelligent serpents that are only out to partake in scientific research rather than attacking anything in their paths. Essentially, while the combat spaces might be simple, the context provided by the narrative tends to serve as their saving grace. The DLC also brings with it a lot of new gear, from weapons to armour pieces and even accessories like rings. However, these offer little in the way of gameplay-altering changes, instead merely being different ways to boost your stats. Depending on at what point of your journey through Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon you decide to kick off your journey into the DLC, you might very well end up with gear that’s much more powerful than anything Sanctuary of Sarras has to offer. To that end, the biggest benefit to doing side quests and roaming off the beaten path to explore the world tends to be learning more about the world and lore rather than a shiny new sword. Since you need to reach Cuanacht in Act 2 to trigger the quest that starts the DLC, chances are high that you will have built up a tidy arsenal before you venture into the depths of Sarras. ""The DLC also brings with it a lot of new gear, from weapons to armour pieces and even accessories like rings."" While our review of the 1.0 release of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon had noted that the title suffered from quite a few technical problems, these issues have seemingly been smoothed out in the months since. Playing the title on an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU, and 32 GB of DDR5-6000 RAM allowed me to maintain solid frame rates of over 100, with only the occasional hiccup when loading into a new area for the first time. I was able to comfortably crank up the graphics settings to the High preset while playing the title at 1440p, facing no issues for most of my play time. Sanctuary of Sarras is an excellent addition to Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon , thanks in large part to how well it helps in fleshing out the already-excellent worldbuilding and lore of the base game. While the DLC’s story is largely self-contained, it also happens to give you a lot more context about the characters of Arthur and Merlin, and slowly learning about a medieval fantasy take on an underwater civilization is a cool concept in and of itself. It isn’t mandatory to understand the main story. Still, it meaningfully enriches the broader mythology of Tainted Grail , which helps to enhance the overarching story thanks to how it builds on the foundations that were already laid by the base game.

2025-12-17T11:39:10,Divinity Director Says Studio is Not Releasing a Game With AI Components or Trimming Down Teams,"While Larian Studios certainly had one of the most interesting trailers during The Game Awards 2025 where it revealed that its next big release will be a new Divinity game , the studio has since fallen in some hot water owing to founder and game director Swen Vincke’s recent interview with Bloomberg . In the interview, Vincke spoke about the studio’s push to use generative AI despite these tools not offering much in the way of efficiency gains. According to Bloomberg, Larian is using generative AI to “explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.” This interview has since caused quite a stir among fans of the studio’s other recent works like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 . While some noted that using generative AI tools for things like PowerPoint presentations might be fine, the fact that these tools are also being used to create concept art for the game acts as a bit of a red flag. As Reddit user Gnl_Winter notes , it “poses an ethical copyright issue, and it also hampers creativity, which is a serendipitous process in which the ideas developed as concept art are essential.” This criticism has prompted Vincke to issue a statement as a follow-up to IGN , where he spoke about how machine learning tools provided to creative teams are working as “additive” to their own talents rather than being serving as replacements. He also noted that Larian currently has 23 concept artists, along with job openings to hire even more. Thanks to this, new concept art is being created on a daily basis for use in ideation as well as production. Check out the full statement below. “We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists, writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.. Since concept art is being called out explicitly – we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.” “Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating. Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft. We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.” “We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.” Vincke also took to social media to issue yet another statement, where he said that Larian is not replacing its concept artists with generative AI tools. He also spoke about having a team of 72 artists in total, and how everything the team is creating is completely original. His statements about the use of generative AI, he noted, came from him simply being asked about the subject during the interview. Expanding further on the use of AI, he said that the tools were used to explore references in a way similar to how books and even Google are often used. Holy fuck guys we’re not ""pushing hard"" for or replacing concept artists with AI. We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do. I was asked explicitly about concept art… — Swen Vincke @where?

2025-12-17T11:17:05,Ghost of Yōtei Studio Co-Founder Brian Fleming is Stepping Down From Leadership Position,"Sony has announced that co-founder of Ghost of Tsushima and Ghost of Yōtei developer Sucker Punch Productions, Brian Fleming, is stepping down from his leadership position. With Fleming having been noted as working on passing the torch to his successors over the last year, he will be stepping down at the end of 2025. The leadership of the studio will be taken up by long time creative and technical leads Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley. Since the studio was founded all the way back in 1997, Fleming has been in charge. The company would become an official part of the PlayStation banner in 2000, and Fleming has steered it throughout the development of a host of games, from the Sly Cooper trilogy on the PS2, to the inFamous series on PS3. After the release of inFamous First Light on the PS4 back in 2014, the studio would then begin work on its most successful release— Ghost of Tsushima . As for Fleming’s successors, both Connell and Bentley have been with Sucker Punch Productions for quite some time. Connell worked as co-director on both Ghost of Tsushima and its sequel, Ghost of Yōtei , while Bentley served as the technical director at the studio, steering its engineering and production efforts. The two will also serve as creative leads for Sucker Punch Productions alongside Nate Fox. “Brian’s vision and leadership have shaped the studio’s culture of creativity and collaboration and established a foundation that Jason, Adrian, and the entire team will build on as they look to the future,” wrote Sony in its announcement. Fleming had previously spoken quite a bit about the studio’s general direction in light of the successful release of Ghost of Yōtei earlier this year. Back in October, he had noted that Sucker Punch Productions will continue to remain a single-project studio , rather than splitting its teams up to work on multiple games at the same time. He revealed this as part of an interview where he noted that, while he may not be sure about the studio’s next major project, he doesn’t want to overextend his teams by juggling multiple projects. He also noted that, while there is no shortage of good ideas to work on, the studio only really gets to pick one thing to work on. “The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly , the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time,” he said. “If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.” “So it kind of has to be your best idea, right?” he continued. “And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. I mean, that is choosing your college and your major every five years.” For more details on the studio’s most recent release, Ghost of Yōtei , check out our review . The game is available on PS5, and just last month got an update that brought with it support for variable refresh rate displays .

2025-12-17T11:01:36,"Terminator: Survivors Delayed to Unknown Date, Early Access and Co-op Canned","If you thought the days of Terminator titles constantly getting delayed were over after Terminator 2D: No Fate finally released, a new challenger has emerged. Nacon’s Terminator: Survivors , a survival game set in the aftermath of Judgment Day, has been delayed again, this time to an unknown date. Previously set for early access in 2024 , it had been delayed to 2025 , but the past several months have been bereft of new information. If there’s any consolation, it’s that Survivors will launch as a full game rather than going through early access first, arriving simultaneously for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Unfortunately, co-op multiplayer is no longer on the table. Nacon Studio Milan creative director Marco Ponte said , “Though we’ve been quiet, we haven’t been idle; this year has been productive, and we’ve made important progress across all fronts, from world design and combat to narrative depth and atmosphere. “After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic ‘ Terminator ‘ experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer. We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.” The developer will share a new release date when it’s ready. However, in the meantime, there will be NDA’d closed playtests with sign-ups currently available here . “We know expectations are high, and we can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on. For now, I can only thank you for sticking with us as we do our absolute best to create a game worthy of the Terminator legacy. We’ll be back with more news as soon as we can,” said Ponte.

While its Featured Tours returned on a limited-time basis, it’s now official : There won’t be any new content. That means no new vehicles, tracks or features are planned according to Turn 10.

On top of keeping servers active, the studio will continue “hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime.” Aside from the underwhelming reception to Forza Motorsport , it’s pretty obvious why the team is shifting gears (no pun intended). It’s working with Playground Games on Forza Horizon 6 , arriving next year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

2025-12-16T18:39:49,PS5 vs Switch 2 vs Xbox : The Year in Review,"I t’s been a year of incredible, incredible highs — this was the year we saw a small unknown team take everyone by surprise with their debut masterpiece, Clair Obscur . This was the year where Metal Gear Solid came back, and the year that Silent Hill got its first original entry in over a decade – and it turned out to be good! This was the year that Kojima put out another masterpiece in Death Stranding 2 , and the year that Donkey Kong returned to the scene with a literal hit. Silksong came out this year, and it was fantastic! Metroid Prime 4 came out this year! So many great things happened that it feels almost ungrateful to be negative about video games after all that. And yet, in spite of how amazing the games themselves have been, this year also had some really dismal lows — and those are all owed to the platform holders who are tasked to be the custodians of the industry. Make no mistake about it — for as successful as games are now as an industry, and as a creative medium, 2025 probably marks the year that gaming consoles, long a stalwart and hallmark of the medium, found themselves on shakier ground than ever before. Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft all variously shot themselves in the foot through the year, making it really hard to root for any of them, with the poor and baffling decisions they kept making. In fact, let’s get this out of the way — if you really want to know which platform holder “won” this year, the only one we’d feel comfortable talking about without feeling icky and gross about validating some pretty poor decisions, is Valve and Steam, who, like every year, entrenched themselves into the hearts and minds of video game fans the world over, and made some major, bold moves that see them in more direct competition with the other three than they have ever been. Especially with their new hardware announcements, they brought a lot of excitement to their platform. Valve and Steam both have their own issues, of course, particularly when it comes to content moderation, but on the whole, they’re the only platform holders who did well without caveats this year. Which brings us to the rest of them. This piece, of course, is about the console manufacturers, so those are the three we’re going to focus on for the remainder. And that’s where… actually you know what, let’s save everyone some time and remove Microsoft from the competition right now. If ever a platform holder has had a period of time where their continued participation in the industry was in question, Xbox’s 2025 would be it. Microsoft opened the floodgates on third party publishing this year, making it clear that ALL their games will hit PS5 (at the very least) going forward. This even extended to Halo, Gears , and Forza – the three pillars of the Xbox brand. Microsoft announcing Halo would be on PlayStation going forward was a surreal moment, akin to seeing Sonic on a Nintendo platform after Sega exited the hardware market following the Dreamcast’s failure. Microsoft’s continued indication to all customers that there is no need for Xbox hardware to play Xbox games ended up becoming a an expected outcome. Sales of Xbox, which had already been in free fall, declined even now precipitously this year, with Xbox consoles being outsold not just by the eight year old Nintendo Switch, which has its successor out on the market already, but in some territories, even being outsold by niche VR and PC handheld hardware. Several retailers the world over even started to make moves to discontinue carrying Xbox hardware entirely — this is something you only see when your sales are Dreamcast or Wii U level poor, to be clear. That’s how badly Microsoft fumbled Xbox this year. The sad part is it didn’t have to turn out like this. Ironically enough, after more than a decade of hyping up their games output and various initiatives like Game Pass, this was the year where things finally came together for Microsoft — their first parties put out several major, largely well received, games, while Game Pass was offering major bangers, including some of the most hyped games of the year in Clair Obscur and Silksong , day and date. Of course, we’re ignoring the several price increases (for hardware AND services, and even an attempted increase for games) along the way — but that only serves to reinforce the infuriating schism between Microsoft’s game output and their business decisions. With Microsoft being out, the other two are a lot closer to each other. In terms of pure sales, Sony had a great year with the PS5 outperforming its sales in 2024. This, incidentally, was in spite of Sony, rather than because of them, because they chose this year to increase the price of the PS5 hardware globally AGAIN. There were some regional exceptions — the U.S. never saw a price increase, while Japan saw a region locked cheaper model introduced — but other than that, five years into the PS5’s life, we are continuing to see prices increase, rather than come down as they would in a sane world. Console pricing wasn’t the only thing Sony increased this year either, as PS Plus prices continued to increase in several markets around the world, such as Canada and Australia. Sony also made some decisions that generated concern among their fanbase, such as the decision to release a PlayStation published game in Helldivers 2 on Xbox. In fact, through the entire year, Sony and PlayStation were marred by small scale controversies — whether that was poor performance and support for PS5 Pro by several games, or them sending mixed signals about when to expect the PS6 (and making no one happy in the process), State of Play events that disappointed multitudes of fans… In fact, arguably the only thing Sony and PlayStation got right this year were the actual games. This is the one area Sony almost always delivers on, and to their credit, they kept that going this year as well. Sony saw two flagship releases for the PS5 this year, with Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yotei . Both of these games were very well received, both sold well, and both are garnering accolades and acclaim on the awards circuit already. This was on top of their existing games, like Astro Bot, Gran Turismo 7 , and Helldivers 2 , which all got great continued post launch support as well. And on top of that, the PS5 remained the best console to play most games on, with PlayStation versions of most third party games read performing better on the base PS5, when compared to the competition. Much like with Xbox, the actual games output was fine — it was the other areas that drew ire. This is sort of a theme in this whole piece, because it also holds true for Nintendo. Nintendo had an extremely eventful year — this was the year that the long awaited Nintendo Switch 2 finally launched, which would make one think, ordinarily, that they’d have it in the bag. But Nintendo made a lot of decisions along the way that proved to be unpopular — from becoming the first publisher to adopt $80 pricing for video games with Mario Kart World , to adopting Sony’s model for paid cross gen upgrades, to high pricing for hardware and accessories across the board, to unpopular DLC policies… The one area where Nintendo always delivers is games, and in 2025, they… mostly did that. Mostly. I’d argue 2025 was actually an uncharacteristically poor showing from Nintendo on the games front, at least compared to their own standards. They put out several games — Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Pokemon Legends ZA, Hyrule Warriors, Kirby Air Riders, Metroid Prime 4 … and except Bananza , which is one of the best games of the year, all of the games were disappointing or divisive in some way or the other. I’d argue their output this year is still better than Microsoft and Sony, because they had more games out, and because they have the highest rated game out between the three — but it’s actually a surprisingly poor showing from a company that otherwise reliably delivers hits. We are also not talking about games like Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour and Drag X Drive , both of which were very poorly received and represent some of the worst reviewed Nintendo games ever. Where the Switch 2 did surprisingly well was third party support. Now, over the Switch generation, Nintendo managed to rebuild their third party relations, and with the Switch 2 being a far more capable platform, and Xbox in particular imploding, it’s not a surprise to see that continue here. However, even here, Nintendo made some baffling decisions, withholding development kits, or in some cases even announcements of Switch 2 versions of third party games. However, in a lot of regards, third parties shone on the Switch this year. Multiple third party publishers seem to have communicated and indicated that the Switch 2 is part of their multiplatform pipeline going forward. Hell, it was  announced Resident Evil Requiem day and date for the Switch 2, which is arguably the biggest show of third party support the system could have gotten other than GTA6 being announced for it. And, as with the original Switch, indies continued to thrive on the platform, with Silksong and Hades 2 (the latter being console exclusive for Switch and Switch 2) being particular highlights. What’s also interesting is that, for all the unpopular decisions Nintendo made this year — and there were so many — their performance on the market never slowed down. In fact, it did the opposite and it accelerated . In spite of a truncated marketing cycle and a lot of backlash from enthusiasts, the Switch 2 broke pretty much every record in the book for a console launch, selling 3.5 million units in three days (something no other system in history has managed) and over 10 million units in four months, keeping a pace of sales far beyond any other platform in history. What made this doubly impressive was that the Switch 2 sold this much in spite of a somewhat lacking lineup — it had Mario Kart and Pokemon Legends , yes, but both were criticized by fans of the respective series, and none of the other releases are major commercial hits. This means that Nintendo still has its biggest system sellers — Mario, Zelda, Animal Crossing , mainline Pokemon — to come, and sales are already this high. It indicates that Nintendo handled this generational transition well, that they have created an ecosystem where players want to stick around, and where they are willing to buy the hardware on faith that the games will come, not unlike PlayStation. Based on the Switch 2’s explosive sales, as well as Nintendo’s lineup being better than either competitor (if still being weaker than Nintendo’s own prior showings), I suppose if I had to pick a platform holder that “won” 2025, it would be Nintendo. But I want to make it known thar I am not happy about this at all, and that I’m awarding Nintendo this “win” under protest. Their litany of business decisions this year were deeply exploitative and alarming, and the only reason that doesn’t put them in last place is that, somehow, the competition was at least as bad as them on this front. Corny as it sounds, this year is a prime example of “whoever wins, we all lose”. Nintendo may have won the console war this year, but they’ve made a lot of people very unhappy along the way, just like Microsoft and Sony also have. For 2026 and onwards, let’s at the very least hope that these console manufacturers can keep their greed in check at least a little bit. But with a whole third of the console market taking itself out of the running, and the sheer state of the hardware components market at the present moment in time, something tells me things might in fact be about to get a whole lot worse.

2025-12-16T18:25:16,15 Single-Player Hidden Gems From 2025 You Shouldn’t Skip,"I t’s been an incredible year of video games despite a few noticeable flops, and single-player experiences continue to be a part of the industry that push its boundaries in many ways. While there were some truly magnificent titles on offer, there were others that enjoyed their success rather quietly but were no less enjoyable in the process. We’re here to give them the spotlight they deserve, and perhaps give you a great new game to pick up and play. Join us as we take a look at a few excellent titles that deserve your attention. There’s something for everybody, and you’re sure to find a title that joins your list of favorites! 1. Blue Prince With a rather unconventional premise, and a whole lot of entertaining puzzle-adventure gameplay to stretch your brain power to its limits, this is a gem of a game that did not get its due in a year crowded with huge releases. But Simon P. Jones’ surreal trip through the Mt. Holly Estate and the discovery of its story make for an unforgettable adventure. If you enjoy solving puzzles and are the kind who doesn’t like to leave any loose ends in their games, this one is going to have you occupied for quite a while. 2. Dispatch It can be jarring to be relegated to a desk job after an exciting stint in the field even for the best of superheroes. But Mecha Man, aka Robert Robinson III, faces a frustrating twist to his career and having to manage a team of reformed supervillains is the perfect recipe for a story that’s told with heart and charm. A stellar voice cast elevates the experience, and Dispatch is a game that you enjoy from the very beginning right up until you navigate a roller coaster of decisions whose varying outcomes could have you wanting to dive back in for another playthrough. That’s certainly a game that’s easy to recommend. 3. Tormented Souls 2 Caroline Walker (or Emma, if you’re familiar with this one’s predecessor) just can’t catch a break. This sequel builds on the first game’s strengths while telling a grim, chilling story about a cult that seems intent on continuing Noah’s work. But Caroline has never been one to sit around and wait for fate to play its hand, and you’re going to be navigating dark hallways and dangerous places with bated breath. This is an excellent horror experience that does well to bring forgotten genre trappings back with style. 4. Keeper It isn’t everyday a game gives a lighthouse the ability to walk, and puts its players behind a character as unique as the one in Keeper . As the lighthouse, your travels aren’t as lonely as they could be thanks to Twig, and the bond that forms between them as they tackle the scourge that’s affecting their home is a lovely story. This one’s bizarre premise lets its creators come up with some very inventive designs in their levels, and navigating its world isn’t going to be easy. But we can tell you it’s definitely worth it. 5. Atomfall An action survival gameplay loop set in an alternate, post-apocalyptic version of the British countryside into a radioactive zone was always going to be a blast, and our time with Atomfall had us chuckling away at the humor that it has managed to bake into an otherwise grim world. The story is definitely gripping enough to make this a rewarding experience while the side content brings some top-shelf writing into the fray. This is a world that’s going to be very worthwhile to those of you who like ferreting out secrets and leaving no missions incomplete. 6. Cronos: The New Dawn The Bloober Team cemented its reputation as a talented horror studio with its take on a time-travelling survival horror adventure. As the Traveller, every step you take into the game’s world makes you feel the weight of its desolation, while its threats can have you missing perfectly aligned headshots thanks to their raw aggression and feral rage. However, for those of you who learn the art of survival in this bleak world, you get to find very creative ways to turn the tables in a deadly dance of tactics, strategy, and skillful shooting. It’s a slow-paced ride but a wild one nonetheless. 7. Hell is Us Although this one did gain a fair bit of traction, it can be hard to put the allure of a world that staunchly refuses to reveal its secrets to none but the most diligent of players into words. But Hell is Us does just that, leaving you scribbling furiously away on a notepad just so that you get to experience all that it has to offer. It can be quite a disorienting experience at first but the story and combat can have you quite invested. If exploration and lore hunting sound like hours of fun to you, this one is going to have you very content with how it presents its best features. 8. Shinobi: Art of Vengeance Fast, stylish, and well-paced, Joe Musashi’s battle against the ENE Corporation is a great game. The story moves along at a breakneck pace, giving you new ways to dish out damage in your 2D platforming adventure. Musashi’s agility and the fact that the stakes are literally about life and death with a dollop of vengeance thrown in make this a shinobi adventure with all the good stuff. Just be ready to bring your best fighting skills to the table as you take on the ENE’s hordes of soldiers, yokai, oni, and imposing bosses. 9. Echoes of the End Although Ryn and Abram’s journey didn’t get the start that developer Myrkur Games might have wanted, the studio has done well to release an enhanced edition of Echoes of the End as a free update, fixing a significant portion of its launch issues and making it a very enticing offering. The combat is now quite good, while the story has several great moments in the second half of the adventure. Stick with this one and you’re going to find yourself quite invested in how things turn out. 10. The Rogue Prince of Persia If you’re a fan of roguelites, this one might be right up your street. Playing a Prince who is on the run from an army of possessed soldiers is a great way to spend a few hours exploring well-designed levels with mechanics that are quite engaging. Evil Empire has done well to capture the look and feel of a Prince of Persia game a action adventure game, and you should definitely give this one a shot. Its recent Switch debut should see it get some well-served attention, too. 11. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound This side-scrolling hack n’ slash spin-off of the popular franchise is definitely up there with the best ones of the year. Kenji Mozu’s inspired effort to defend the Hayabusa village from demonic threats, leaving Ryu free to live out his legend in America, is a very entertaining take on the Ninja Gaiden universe. Its slick combat and challenging platforming make it a pleasure to play too. This is a great choice for those of you who love to let your blades do the talking. 12. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers If you’re a Soulslike fan and have somehow missed this one from Leenshee Games, it’s worth checking out. Bai Wuchang’s mission to save her sister quickly turns into an exploration of sinister events against the background of a failing dynasty. That premise does very well to set up battles that can test your reflexes and ability to improvise in the field. Combat is an art in this game, and you’re given a wide set of tools to use as you paint a bloody canvas that tells an epic story. Expect to be challenged, and this one is going to take your breath away. 13. Shadow Labyrinth Bandai Namco’s refresh of the classic character was such a blast we almost forgot our initial scepticism of the entire exercise. The swordsman and Puck are quite a duo, navigating a treacherous world that leaves a very interesting trail of information about its history and denizens. With challenging enemies and mechanics, Shadow Labyrinth is a game that has you always on the lookout for a detail that you missed, and can take a long time if you’re intent on teasing out all of its secrets. 14. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream While it can be difficult to handle the emotional weight that this excellent story brings to the table, Hanna’s desperate journey to rescue her brother, and the people she meets along the way make this one a worthy addition to our list of 2025’s underrated gems. This is a game that brings some great stealth mechanics in a world in which the shadows are your biggest strength, and a story that underlines the importance of staying unseen through the eyes of a young orphan. This one’s a winner for all of you stealth nuts out there. 15. Steel Seed Bringing excellent stealth action, robust platforming, a dark sci-fi-world, and a relatable protagonist and companion duo, there’s a lot to like about Steel Seed. Although this one did draw a bit of flak on the critical front, its story and excellent world building are compelling reasons to dive into this title. Zoe’s sassy yet earnest nature wins you over quite quickly, and her proficiency with her weapons make her fun to embody in this tale of redemption. Despite a relatively shorter runtime, this game has its charms, and the journey is definitely worth it. And that’s a wrap on our best single-player sleeper hit titles that you might have missed out on this year. Here’s to a fresh new batch of winners as we look to 2026 and beyond.",2025-12-17T11:45:55.472661,Varun Karunakar,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/15-single-player-hidden-gems-from-2025-you-shouldnt-skip,f3d6b88f8c45a2573d78224c4afe00ef093f227b,1702,en,0.1,"I t’s been an incredible year of video games despite a few noticeable flops, and single-player experiences continue to be a part of the industry that push its boundaries in many wa",other,0.25
2025-12-16T18:16:26,Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s “Thank You” Update is Fantastic – Here’s Why,"Y ou knew it was coming, but it still felt pretty good to see Clair Obscur sweeping The Game Awards. From composer Lorien Testard and lead vocalist Alice Duport-Percier winning Best Soundtrack to the nervousness of Guillaume Broche accepting Best Direction and eventually Game of the Year, it was a lovely night overall. Of course, Sandfall Interactive didn’t just leave things on that note and released the game’s major free update before the show went off the air. Simply titled “Thank You,” this is less of a patch with some new content and more like free DLC. And, above all else, it’s fantastic. Let’s dive into everything great about this, starting with the new area. Light spoilers follow for certain bosses if you have yet to explore much of the game, but we’ll keep story spoilers to a minimum. Definitely on the larger side compared to many others in the game, it’s considered one of the oldest parts of the world, and it’s easy to see why. Upon entering, it feels like paint is scattered haphazardly in places; other spots feature simpler, child-like patterns. It’s not long before you’re introduced to the gorgeously bizarre landscape as a whole, teeming with lollipops, balloons, and the giant stone face of Esquie in the distance. Even the save point flag isn’t a traditional Expedition banner, but one of a familiar-looking boy and his dog, playing. Further exploration yields even more incredible sights. Gestrals are simply hanging out in the resort-like surroundings. Esquie-shaped flowers blooming all over the place. Even a joyous carousel that each party member can take turns riding on (unlocking some neat outfits and hairstyles as a result). A lone piano awaits in a treehouse. It’s almost like a vacation away from the main game, which makes sense given its purpose as a hideout. There are still plenty of threats awaiting, though, as the upbeat music twists into something more melancholic whenever danger is near. New Chromatic enemeis await, which introduce the cotton candy-styled Barbapapa effect. Any character afflicted by this has their skill damage reduced to 1 for the next hit. So if you’re using any multi-hit skills – Crystal Crush with Lune, for example – the first hit will only deal 1 damage. If you have four stacks, then it can effectively neutralize the former’s entire combo. Fortunately, new Pictos and weapons abound to provide some advantages and new build-crafting possibilities. They start simple enough, like automatically consuming a Healing Tint if your health drops below 50 percent or inflicting Slow with basic attacks for one turn. Then you have truly insane stuff, like consuming three Gradient Charges to deal 200 percent more damage for that turn. Don’t worry about building the Gradient bar either – equip Gradient Parry and voila, five percent earned with each successful parry (and there’s a lot of parrying to do in this DLC). The weapons are no joke either, including Duollison for Sciel, which allows Free Aims to apply one Foretell. Execute a Base Attack, and you’ll deal 50 percent more damage per Foretell Consumed. Do this during the Twilight phase, and that Foretell won’t be consumed, allowing you to effectively scale damage for your Base Attack. Don’t even get me started on Esquim for Lune, which converts all Stains generated from Base Attacks into Dark Stains – if you have four of them active, your next Skill consumes them all to deal 300 percent more damage. Combine that with everything else, and suddenly, Lune becomes the nuke, wiping out bosses left and right. Though that may not necessarily apply to the newest bosses. Osquio will probably be the first if you go through the new area first, and while he won’t deal too much damage for late-game characters, parrying his attacks and avoiding the Barbapapa status for those big, damaging skills is vital. Of course, this entire exercise is more whimsical than life-threatening, but it’s still great for sharpening your skills if you haven’t played in a while. If you choose to explore the new area further, you’ll discover hidden puzzles, and some funny conversations with Gestrals. But if it’s a greater challenge you want, head on over to the Endless Tower where four new bosses await. And they’re definitely no joke. Remember the Duolliste boss that wiped out many expeditions before yours? How about fighting two at once? To clarify, you’re not just fighting two of them – they’re both almost constantly attacking at the same time, and the combos are long. Of course, they’ll seem like a mercy when you encounter the Chromatic Lampmaster, whose lamp trial and projectiles remain as obnoxious as ever. You’ll also fight a stronger version of a boss from the Flying Manor, which ups the memory game aspect of its regular version by only allowing you to deal damage if you successfully counterattack. However, all of them pale in comparison to Simon, the Divergent Star. As a stronger version of the strongest post-game boss, every single aspect of this fight is a test of your utmost parrying and jumping skills. Of course, you’ll also need some of the strongest weapons, skills and Pictos in the game to stand a chance. A truly fitting test for some of the most broken builds out there. Even if you don’t challenge what’s now the toughest content in the game, this update offers a lot in terms of quality-of-life features and new additions. Photo Mode is one, finally allowing you to capture the game’s gorgeous art direction and characters from every angle. You can also finally save multiple Lumina loadouts instead of manually swapping them out depending on the boss. Other outfits and hairstyles lie waiting to be discovered, and if you haven’t had a chance to mop all the content, there are plenty of additional resources, like Chroma Catalysts and Lumina Points, to power up your party. Adding on to all this is FSR 4 upscaling and Frame Generation support for smoother performance, input remapping for more comfortable play, and even an option to scale the HUD’s elements. Combined with Steam Deck and ROG Xbox Ally verification – alongside other tweaks like adjusted graphics settings, turning off VSync, and better text legibility- and Clair Obscur is now even better to play on the go. What’s interesting about this update is that it feels like a send-off of sorts for the title that captured so many hearts and minds throughout the year. The overarching universe will no doubt continue – it wouldn’t surprise anyone if Sandfall wanted to expand Clair Obscur to encompass other mediums and emotions. But there’s a celebration to all of this and, more importantly, an appreciation, which is still funny considering that the development team essentially gave away a DLC-sized update for free. With the new year upon us and many more hyped titles to come, it’s worth looking back at what Clair Obscur accomplished. From an underdog releasing in the shadow of a much bigger franchise to a universally beloved RPG and now a record-setting Game of the Year winner, it’s something special that comes around only so often. Here’s hoping it’s only the beginning of Sandfall’s legacy and the cornerstone for many more excellent RPGs to come.

2025-12-16T15:42:06,The Legend of Zelda Franchise GM Wants Monolith Soft to “Create a Unique Title in the Series”,"Monolith Soft is well known for its technical capabilities in game development, especially when it comes to making large open-world games with limited hardware. The studio has previously worked on a number of games, from the Xenoblade Chronicles series of RPGs, to Nintendo’s flagship titles like The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword , Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom . In a new interview on the studio’s official website , Nintendo’s general manager for The Legend of Zelda series, Daiki Iwamoto, spoke with Monolith Soft’s animator and director Yasuhiro Fujita about the two companies working together. While the duo discussed several projects throughout the interview, one of the most interesting details came from Iwamoto talking about wanting to work with Monolith Soft again in another game in the Zelda series. He praised the studio as being a “strong partner” when it comes to making games in the Zelda franchise, and went on to say that they should “use the know-how we’ve developed by working together” to make a new unique title in the series. “Monolith Soft is a strong partner when it comes to developing Zelda games from scratch,” said Iwamoto. “And more and more I would like to see them taking on a central role in production. Going forward, let’s use the know-how we’ve developed by working together, and the strength of the whole Monolith Soft team, to create a unique title in the series together.” While this by no means serves as definitive confirmation that the next mainline entry in The Legend of Zelda franchise will be developed by Monolith Soft, Nintendo and the developer are quite likely already working on something new for the series in the background. Elsewhere in the interview, Fujita also discussed the role Monolith Soft had played in the development of Zelda games, and how it has evolved since its work on Skyward Sword . “Monolith Soft now has a larger number of developers, and the way we’re involved has changed,” said Fujita. “With Skyward Sword , the main relationship was that Monolith Soft would create the data in accordance with the game design and specifications laid out by Nintendo, but with Breath of the Wild , we’re more likely to ‘think and create together.'” While the studio had been working with Nintendo for quite some time with the latter owning 96 percent of the studio as of 2011, Nintendo became a 100 percent owner of Monolith Soft back in December 2024. While this didn’t really change much since Nintendo was already the majority stakeholder in the studio, Monolith Soft now being owned 100 percent by the company likely means that it has more access to the internal infrastructure and support system that had already been set up. In June, Monolith Soft had revealed that it wasn’t just working on Xenoblade Chronicles and The Legend of Zelda games. It had also provided support in developing Nintendo Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World . While details were sparse, the studio confirmed that Nintendo contracted it to work on the kart racer’s open world and character designs.",2025-12-17T11:45:55.481590,Joelle Daniels,"Video Game News, Reviews, Walkthroughs And Guides | GamingBolt",https://gamingbolt.com/the-legend-of-zelda-franchise-gm-wants-monolith-soft-to-create-a-unique-title-in-the-series,02eea97f7a89824135f7016cc4c2e3cf42495be8,1705,en,0.1,"Monolith Soft is well known for its technical capabilities in game development, especially when it comes to making large open-world games with limited hardware.

2025-12-17T06:17:25,"It has finally happened, chat: Supervive is shutting down","After years of decline, Supervive is officially dead. The short life of Supervive has been an interesting one. While the game has seen a drastically declining playercount this past year, the dedicated fans have been supporting the game like crazy, making the shut down all the more bittersweet. What went wrong with Supervive? Supervive was a complex MOBA created by Theorycraft Games, a team made up of former Riot employees and other experienced devs in the competitive space. Fans of the genre-bending competitive game and its unique features stuck around, but they noticed a huge decline soon after the initial launch hype. Fans of the game noticed the rapid decline, pointing to player retention as the issue due to the game not feeling rewarding to play. One player on Reddit begged developers to add rewards for continuously playing the game or logging in. Others felt it took too much effort to unlock new characters. Another big reoccurring complaint are the game modes. Supervive was focused on the Battlerite mode, rather than the traditional 5v5 or 6v6 of popular MOBA titles focused on laning. This caused some to say it was a glorified battle royale rather than a MOBA. Either way, maybe it shoulda picked a lane. Get it? Despite the large issues with the game, the fanbase was quite dedicated. And worried. This entire year, players have been speculating if Supervive would fight on or not. “We got into Supervive a while back on a whim and loved every second of it, it just felt so fresh, and with the unique characters, awesome art style, and fun gameplay that doesnt feel punishing to your life if you lose, it really felt like the perfect game for us,” one player said on Reddi t three months ago. “Now we are trying ranked and it’s taking us soooo long to get a game that I am super worried about how long this game has, like finally we found the game that scratched that itch and it just doesn’t look good.” When is Supervive shutting down? Executive Producer Jess Nam announced the Supervive shutdown on YouTube earlier this evening. She explained that the game was something “magical” but the retention has continued to be an issue no matter the changes made . This has led the game to be unsustainable for the small team. For now, Supervive developers will be releasing Patch 2.04 with a final bundle of completed skins, all free of course. Then, Supervive live service ends at the end of February 2025. The response from the gaming community has largely been devastating. Fans shared their sadness over the news all over X, Reddit, and YouTube. One comment said: “This has been the most fun I have ever had with a game before. It’s gonna be hard to say goodbye.” What’s next for Theorycraft Gaming? While Supervive is no more, the team behind the game doesn’t want to give up. Theorycraft Gaming is working on a new game after “going dark” for a bit. Nam said that the next game is “going to look very different,” lying somewhere between indie and AAA. The genre was not mentioned, but it’s possible it won’t be live service due to the cost of maintaining this type of game for such a small team.

Ketsu Battler is bringing butt vs butt action into the esports world On Sunday, January 18th, 2026, get ready to see a serious esports battle between the buttcheeks. While some amateur fighters will secure the Joy-Con in their belt, game publisher KAYAC is encouraging contestants to read the manga for inspiration on the true fighting form. About 128 fighters will compete booty to booty on stage in a single-elimination best-of-three format. Once the four masters of crack-gripping, butt swinging action become clear, they will move to a best-of-five format. If you win, you’ll get a signed copy of the Ketsu Battler manga.

2025-12-16T22:25:05,Bad challege designs are ruining video games,"Imagine for a moment, you log onto Battlefield 6 and hop into a game, only to find that half – actually half – of the lobby is drone spotting the enemy. Almost no one is pushing the objectives, and because everyone is fighting for the spot credit, almost no one is getting that either. You proceed to play a weird ghost town of a game, where you are constantly getting shot in the back, and you barely see any teammates. That has been a reality in the game this past week, as folks attempt to complete a special challenge to spot enemies with the drone in exchange for the highly coveted in-game advertisement for Red Bull — a little Red Bull can that hangs on your weapon. That way, you can always remind yourself to buy Redbull every time you play the game! Putting aside the corporate shillery of it all, bad challenge designs like this are detrimental to the experience of playing first-person shooters in this, the year of our lord 2025 (almost 2026). The poverty of challenge-based gameplay loops Look, challenges and achievements are nothing new. For decades now, achievement hunters have scoured games, trying to tick those boxes in pursuit of the elusive 100%. Those challenges also found their way into multiplayer games, asking players to explore new places and try new weapons in exchange for special unlocks and boosts to the XP. On their own, challenges are not really a problem if they are carefully designed. In fact, sometimes challenges can encourage good behavior, like motivating team revives or teaching players to master mechanics that make the game more dynamic and fun to play. However, there are some challenges that can ruin the gaming experience. Fortnite learned this lesson back in 2018, when it asked players to dance with enemy players to complete a weekly challenge. At the time, there were very few ways to earn extra XP, so challenges were crucial to completing a battle pass. The result was frustrating chaos, wherein players were forced to technically break the rules by teaming up to achieve a challenge, only to turn on each other mid-challenge. Battlefield 6 is currently learning this lesson, with the aforementioned Red Bull Recon challenge. Lobbies in many cases feel dead, or worse, if your team is all wrapped up in drones, while the other team is PTFOing your face off. It turns out, telling everyone to do something that really only one or two players should be doing at any given time sorta makes Battlefield 6 a bad game. And even when the challenge doesn’t harm your teammates, a bad challenge can turn something that is supposed to be fun into a chore. Halo Infinite, for example, infamously tied many of its weekly challenges to specific, often unpopular, game modes. Many players flooded into modes that they didn’t like in hopes that they could get some of those unlocks. At that point, it makes you ask, Is this making the game better? Am I having fun? Are challenges really making games better? Shooter fans are looking for something a bit different (or maybe, familiar). Image credit: EA I understand that challenges are a hit for many gamers. Especially in battle royale and sandbox contexts, they offer a fresh goal and help direct players who lack direction or are looking for extra motivation. But when the challenge grind becomes the entire gameplay loop, the reason you play the game, it can detract from the core game experience and leave core-game enjoyers like me wondering — is this really the point now? Grinding unlocks will always be a big motivating factor for gamers to stick with a game; I am not denying that. But there is a big difference between leveling up a gun by playing the game with it or taking on a challenge in a single-player mode, and chasing rabbits down rabbit holes in the hopes of getting a sorta sad looking Red Bull advertisement for your weapon. At some point, bad challenge designs don’t just take players engaging in the challenge away from the core experience, they hurt their team as well. Instead of fighting for the objective, and working with your squad to walk away with the W, your teammates can be found huddling in a corner controlling a drone or trying to get hipfire kills with an assault rifle for some reason all while completely ignoring the objective. This is made worse by the universal nature of many of these challenges, where all the players have to complete the same criteria at the same time within a certain window to get the prize — it’s not well considered. So for the devs, when you are designing a challenge, especially one with a desirable reward, make sure it encourages desirable behavior. If it’s not, you may be poisoning the well of your very own game. And if you are going to put in a challenge like this Red Bull Recon challenge, consider staggering it so that players are all trying to complete it at once. Please and thank you.

2025-12-16T22:24:15,How South Korea wants to prevent gaming’s worst behavior,"For years, gamers have complained that random-number-generation, or RNG, in modern games can feel less like randomness and more like a carefully managed revenue stream. It’s no different in South Korea, where players have consistently decried gacha mechanics and loot boxes. This week, that frustration briefly escaped the usual habitat of Discord threads and forum meltdowns, instead landing somewhere stranger: a presidential policy briefing. On December 16th, President Lee Jae-myung pushed for tougher, profit-focused penalties against game companies accused of manipulating or misrepresenting the drop rates of probabilistic items. The thrust of Lee’s message was simple: if the incentive is money, then the punishment should take money. At the briefing, Lee pressed Seo Tae-gun, Chair of the Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC), on whether regulators actually understand how angry players are when expensive items don’t drop — especially when probabilities are missing, unclear, or allegedly falsified. Seo outlined enforcement efforts, including a task force and a 27-person operation doing online monitoring for missing or false probability displays. Seo also described a sanctions ladder where most cases end at “corrective action” requests, and only a small number escalate to blocking measures or investigative referrals. Lee was not impressed by the “we asked nicely three times” vibe. According to local reporting, he criticized the current process as overly circuitous and argued that criminal punishment, in practice, often results in small fines or suspended sentences — not exactly a deterrent for companies that can bake risk into their business model. His proposed fix was what Korean officials have described as a “financial corrective treatment” approach: impose meaningful penalty surcharges for the violation itself, and structure them to claw back unjust profits. This isn’t happening in a vacuum. Korea has been tightening its approach to loot box-style mechanics, including rules around probability disclosures and stronger remedies for consumers when disclosures are missing or deceptive. And globally, governments are still arguing over whether loot boxes are gambling, consumer fraud, or “just videogames”: Belgium’s hardline stance has been widely discussed, the UK has leaned heavily on industry-led protections, and China has required probability disclosure for years. The answer to cyberbullying? Cyberfining Then came the second, very Korean, very 2025 twist: lawmakers aiming that same “make it hurt financially” philosophy at gamers themselves — those who participate in esports cyberbullying. Also this month, Jeon Yong-gi, a Democratic Party of Korea lawmaker, introduced a bill that would help courts award higher damages for emotional distress in cases of malicious cyberbullying — explicitly framing coordinated harassment within esports communities as socially harmful violence. The bill is an amendment to the Court Organization Act, and it’s designed to move Korea away from what Jeon calls “token compensation” and toward damages that actually deter bad actors. Instead of just saying “we should punish people more,” the bill tries to fix a practical problem: courts don’t have a clear, consistent way to decide how much money someone should get for emotional harm. It would give a Supreme Court body the task of studying past cases and creating shared guidelines — basically a reference chart that judges can use when deciding damages. The idea is that if judges have better guidance, the payouts won’t be so randomly low, and they’ll be more consistent and more likely to actually deter harassment. Jeon’s move follows his earlier, very public criticism of coordinated harassment linked to an online fan community centered around T1, which has been condemned for targeting pro players with abusive comments. Taken together, these two stories feel like a government finally acknowledging something gamers have been complaining about for a decade: financial incentives shape behavior. If companies can profit from blurred odds, or if anonymous mobs can ruin someone’s life at a cost of essentially $0, then the system is basically encouraging the worst outcomes. “Financial treatment” is an attempt to rewrite the incentive structure. Image Credit: Yonhap News Agency Is it wise? In a relatively functional system, it can be. Targeted economic penalties can be faster and more proportionate than criminal prosecutions, and clear civil standards can help victims pursue real relief without needing a once-in-a-generation court ruling. But “financial deterrence” is also a sharp tool — and sharp tools have a way of ending up in the hands of people who should absolutely not be holding them. In less competent (or less accountable) governments, a regime of vague “financial penalties” can morph into selective enforcement, political favour-trading, or a backdoor way to pressure speech and communities under the banner of “protecting users.” Korea’s challenge — and any other country watching — is to build guardrails that make enforcement transparent, evidence-based, and appealable, rather than becoming yet another system where power decides what “harm” counts. Because if the lesson governments take from gaming is “follow the money,” the next question is unavoidable: who gets to aim that lesson, and at whom?

2025-12-16T21:51:51,“We all wish it went a little bit faster”: Bethesda speaks on The Elder Scrolls 6 development,"Bethesda developers have given us an update on The Elder Scrolls 6 and it’s sorta whatever. The Elder Scrolls 6 was first announced back in 2018 with a very vague cinematic trailer. Since then, we’ve basically heard nothing. And we definitely haven’t seen anything. It’s now been 14 years since the launch of Skyrim and gamers feel like it could be 14 more until The Elder Scrolls 6 is launched. Bethesda finally says something (sorta) about The Elder Scrolls 6 In an interview with Game Informer , Tedd Howard, Angela Browder, and Emil Pagliarulo discussed the development of The Elder Scrolls 6. According to Howard, development is “progressing really well.” And it hasn’t been as much of an afterthought as gamers believed. “The majority of the studio’s on VI, but I’ll say this: We always overlap,” Howard said. “So, we’re very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. “And it’s a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster – or a lot faster – but it’s a process that we want to get right.” While we were still given no real information about The Elder Scrolls 6 (no plot, no gameplay elements), we did learn from Browder that we should expect “endless possibilities” and a look at how the gaming industry has advanced since Skyrim. In other words: “It’s gonna be dope.” When is The Elder Scrolls 6 coming out? Glad you asked. WE DON’T KNOW! Anyway, Pagliarulo said that Bethesda is feeling the “time pressure” from desperate fans. However, they don’t put that same pressure on themselves. In other words, they’re not willing to rush the process simply because players want the game to be released. That doesn’t mean gamers are being ignored, of course. They acknowledged gamers’ frustrations, but Pagliarulo noted: “What do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?” So there you have it. The carefully curated answers from a team that was already well-prepared to not give us any answers. Not a surprise after Howard claimed he wanted to “shadow drop” The Elder Scrolls 6 .

Initially teased way back in 2016, Umamusume launched in Japan with an anime first and then the game in 2021. Since then, it’s been one of Cygames’ rocks in an ever-changing industry. Not even the studio’s Nintendo-backed game, Dragalia Lost, could make it. Gamebiz – and translated by Automaton West – reports that net profit increased by a whopping 136.5% year-on-year. That’s tallied at 33.1 billion yen (~$213 million). Alongside this, operating profit increased 103.3% to 33.1 billion yen (around $213 million), and it saw a 3% rise in revenue to 137.5 billion yen (roughly $886 million). Umamusume has had quite a successful month, too. The game went on to win Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards , cementing the gacha genre’s dominance at Geoff Keighley’s event. They’ve since handed out a few freebies to go alongside that. Cygames recently updated Umamusume in the West so that it matches the pace of the Japanese version. The update smooths over quite a bit of the initial version’s bumps with quality-of-life additions that don’t particularly take from the game. Umamusume has continued to hold a steady pace since the launch hype for the game slowed down. On Steam, the game is averaging around 17,000 players every 24 hours, with no real sudden drop-offs outside of the peak back in July. Umamusume catches its first PETA stray Recently, animal rights activists PETA drew the ire of Umamusume fans after they posted an image of a horsegirl snapping her leg to the bone. It was supposed to raise concerns about horses being put down after injury in a race. I think the rather embarrassing nerd reason that it breaks Cygames’ rules for art is not the point here. It also fails to understand why horses get put down if they bust their leg. That, and PETA employees were linked to the dumping of 18 animal corpses after “rescuing” them from a shelter. It has also been reported that PETA puts down 60-70% more than any other monitored shelter or rescue. Have you ever seen a horse try and rehabilitate 1000 pounds on three legs? I went and looked after the PETA post. It’s not pretty, even on a loving farm. Horse racing isn’t exactly a pristine thing, but I guess putting a horse through suffering is. Also, don’t look up “horse with no hoof,” I almost vomited.

2025-12-16T19:14:47,Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis release: Exploring below the surface of the remake,"This page mixes confirmed information with industry rumors and speculation. We’ll keep it updated as new details and leaks come to light. The Game Awards 2025 gave us not one but two Lara Croft adventures to mark on our calendars, starting with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis . Described as a “reimagining” rather than a simple remake, this updated version of the 1996 original adventure is said to have several surprises in store for fans. How fitting that we return to the very beginning in the Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis game, albeit with a few extra details thrown in, to prepare for the launch of Tomb Raider: Catalyst . There’s a lot to unpack, and The Escapist is eager to get started, so it’s high time we plaited our hair, readied our pistols, and dived below the surface of this exciting remake. The Escapist recaps Lara Croft being featured at The Game Awards 2025 had only been teased days before the show , but fans were unsure of what to expect. Then, at The Game Awards 2025, Tomb Raider: Catalyst was announced alongside Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Unlike Tomb Raider: Catalyst , the Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis game returns to the very first Lara Croft adventure. A remastered collection of the first three Tomb Raider titles was released in 2024; however, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis goes beyond to deliver a modernized reimagining that promises to add “new surprises”. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis ’ release date is 2026 and will mark the 30th anniversary of the first game. When could Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis be released? Lara returns to her roots in Legacy of Atlantis. Image credit: Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis ’ release date is 2026. Although we don’t have to wait too long, in theory, nothing beyond a vague 12-month release window has been provided. In a similar vein to the Tomb Raider: Catalyst announcement, Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog are keeping certain details back until the time is right. Still, the Tomb Raider 1996 remake has got fans excited, even without a specific release date. Expected Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis price & pre-orders The visuals of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis are something else. Image credit: Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis ’ price hasn’t been shared, and likely won’t be until closer to its release. As a result, there are no pre-order options available; however, you can wishlist the title on your preferred platform. That being said, it’s wise to expect a minimum price of $69.99. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis platforms Oh, how we remember these death-defying puzzles. Image credit: Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog The Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis remake will be available on PC (Steam), Xbox Series S/X, and PlayStation 5. Similar to Tomb Raider: Catalyst , there’s no mention of a Switch 2 launch yet, nor do we know if one will be coming anytime soon. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis trailer & gameplay analysis If you were there to see Lara Croft’s 1996 debut, the chances are you know the story of the first game off by heart: Lara is searching for pieces of the Scion, an artifact that has unimaginable power, and which takes her across the globe to uncover the secrets of Atlantis. “Some legends are destined to be retold,” says Lara, and she’s not wrong. However, while the Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis trailer showcased many familiar and iconic locations from the 1996 title, it also hinted at new content. Therefore, none of us can assume we know the story in its entirety. Despite there being “new surprises” on the way, the developers have stated that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is about “honoring the spirit and atmosphere” of the original. And while this remake is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and looks incredible, the essence of the first game shines through. Most notably, in its aesthetics. Although Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis looks like a totally new game graphically, the visuals have a more cartoonish edge to them, akin to the kind of graphics we saw in 1996. Furthermore, Lara and the environments she explores are more colorful than the ones seen in the Tomb Raider: Catalyst trailer. Clearly, homage is being paid to that nostalgic aesthetic we remember fondly. Gameplay-wise, there’s a mix of pre-alpha gameplay footage and cinematic scenes utilized in the trailer. Footage looks smooth, with Lara jumping, swinging, swimming, and shooting her way through Peru, Greece, Egypt, and beyond. She’ll also be solving puzzles, a gameplay feature that was synonymous with the original games but has taken a backseat in newer installments. Ask The Escapist Is Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis a remake? Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a remake, though Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog describe it as a “reimagining.” This isn’t just a rehash of what’s gone before; this is building on the original story and adding new content for us to discover. How does Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis relate to Tomb Raider: Catalyst? Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is the 1996 debut title reimagined and introduces you to Lara Croft during one of her most harrowing adventures. Whereas Tomb Raider: Catalyst is a new adventure told further along in her career, after the events of the Legend Trilogy. In this way, Tomb Raider: Catalyst follows on from Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, but not directly. How is Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis different from Tomb Raider Anniversary? With so many Tomb Raider remakes and reboots, the canon story becomes a little difficult to follow, even for veteran fans. Tomb Raider Anniversary is also a remake of the first game; however, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis expands on the original lore and adds more details. Who is developing Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis? Crystal Dynamics and Wild Flying Hog are the co-developers of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, with Amazon Game Studios as the publisher.

2025-12-16T17:32:04,Goddess of Victory: Nikke developers still “compiling” list of changes coming to gacha game,"Shift Up, the developers behind Stellar Blade and Goddess of Victory: Nikke, have revealed their plans for the gacha game. Nikke has just had its third anniversary, but the team is – of course – already looking ahead. The message comes from the game’s director, Hyungsuk Yoo, who hopes we don’t catch a cold. In fact, there’s “no pressure at all” when it comes to reading this, apparently. What a relaxed press release. So what’s coming or changing in NIKKE going forward? A whole host of quality of life changes, along with details about the upcoming New Year’s update. Rerun event for Nikke New Year Update From January 1, a rerun of the banner, Rapi: Red Hood, will headline New Year’s. There’s apparently a new story that Yoo has been wanting to “tell for a long time.” Shift Up is also extending the Bonus Recruit period until December 31, 2026, and expanding who is available. From December 31, 2025, bonus recruits will include: Liter Naga Alice Helm Tia Nikke will also increase the redeemable points from 600 to 1000 for additional gacha gains. Shift Up lays out update plans for “Surface” mode It’s a little surprising to see a press release talk so openly about its game, especially in the capacity Yoo is in this press release. “Surface” is the game’s relatively new mode, bringing a strategy experience to the gallery-shooting of the main game. It’s all done on a hexagonal grid map, but Shift Up plans to tackle the biggest issues in the mode. Yoo says this is to “reduce the burden” of people grinding out the mode every day, something Shift Up has been excellent about in the past. I was super into Destiny Child, the company’s first gacha game. I would leave it open in an emulator overnight at the office (free internet and power!), looping indefinitely in the background while it ground away at everything. Seeing that same sentiment coming through for Nikke all these years later sparks a little hope inside my gut. First, they’re fixing the movement speed. “When not in combat”, characters will now move faster around the map. It’ll also remove “required currency and attempt limits” from Rapid Deployment. This will help get rid of any hoops needed to jump through when activating it. Those on mobile should expect to see improved responsiveness for the controls and a reduction in “unnecessary touches”. I think that’s a roundabout way of saying, “Yeah, this takes too many clicks.” Lastly, under “Gameplay pressure reduction”, these changes are coming to Surface mode: Limit sector units to hours during the early exploration phase to spread out playtime Significantly reduce the occupation requirements for the main gameplay, such as gateway battles Significantly reduce the HP of Tyrant-class Raptures Make changes so that occupied areas are permanently saved when captured (removal of the battery concept) Completely revamp the usage of the hospital Change the main consumption points for Surface materials from the factory to Hexacode Block production to ease pressure These are just the confirmed changes coming to the game, with Yoo and Shift Up saying they’re “compiling” the list. Less crossovers for Goddess of Victory: Nikke One thing that is changing, possibly for the better, is that Shift Up plans on cutting crossovers to just two next year. This year saw three, including Resident Evil , but next year will be only the two. This is to shift focus back to the main game’s story, something that Yoo seems quite excited about : “In the coming days, I will also give it my all and focus on making more interesting and meaningful stories for Goddess of Victory: Nikke .” The post Goddess of Victory: Nikke developers still “compiling” list of changes coming to gacha game appeared first on The Escapist .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.495973,Joel Loynds,The Escapist,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-goddess-of-victory-nikke-developers-still-compiling-list-of-changes/,3dfc52804fb94e9466fbba4c3d50979e0da151b4,1713,en,0.1,"Shift Up, the developers behind Stellar Blade and Goddess of Victory: Nikke, have revealed their plans for the gacha game.

2025-12-16T17:29:52,Total War: Warhammer 40K factions round table reveals unique Space Marine Limits and Aeldari Webway Travel,"Creative Assembly teased that a new fantasy game was on the way. And, at The Game Awards, it revealed Total War: Warhammer 40,000 . With the fantasy trilogy put to bed, bar some DLC of course, the main focus is on getting the 40K setting to us. We already know that the Space Marines, Militarum, Aeldari and Orks are on the way. Yet, a recent developer roundtable revealed some more information on how the Total War 40K factions work. During the interview, the developers discussed what’s so special about the factions. The Militarum are traditional Total War factions. Large armies, lots of units, upgrade your buildings and acquire resources to get even better units, that type of thing. The Orks are similar too, pulling from the Waaagh! feature, with building resources to use the scrap to get new units. Ork armies want to continue pushing onwards and fighting, so they don’t turn around and start bashing themselves. The usual Ork stuff. If you’ve played Warhammer Fantasy Total War, chances are there’s some crossover by the sounds of things, even if the mechanics and setting are different. Space Marines Yet, the more interesting ones are for sure the Space Marines. The Space Marines aim to be lore accurate. The Chapters in lore tend to only have about 2,000 soldiers per Chapter, with successor chapters having to splinter off to accommodate more Marines. That’s background is taken into consideration for the style of play that the Space Marines offer. You’ll get a few hundred troops in super-large armies, but the troops inside them are basically super soldiers. It’s about balancing that few in number but strength of one type attitude. There are teasers that their map control will work differently, too, compared to classical Total War gameplay. Aeldari Then we have the Aeldari. The faction is even stranger than your usual Total War faction. The Aeldari are described as any soul lost is not replaced, thanks to the lore of the franchise. Instead, Aeldari are all about trying to avoid conflict, using super advanced technologies and ambushes to offset their few in numbers to overwhelm enemy forces. They also rely on Webway Gates to zip in and around the galaxy to traverse rather than traditional Total War campaign map routes. Craftworlds play an important role as their home turf, which is where most of their city management takes place. So they won’t rely on the usual Total War campaign map management, even with the devs confirming that stuff works differently, too. The other thing the devs state is the Aledari are there for crisis management. Campaigns have major impacts on the future Crusades, which is what the devs are calling the grander campaigns now. Campaigns for specific sectors have lasting results, leaving behind scars, crises and other events. So, the Aeldari seem to be about that from what we can tell. It seems like there’s a lot of flair and uniqueness coming to the game. How they pull it off remains to be seen. But the video seems to suggest some very interesting stuff is coming to the factions in Total War: Warhammer 40,000. If you’re curious, you can find the deep dive discussion below. The chat on faction design is between 2-10 minutes, with the factions spread at different points. The latter portions of the video describe how the Grand Crusade works, various campaign layers, and even discuss Exterminatus protocols in-game. There’s a preview of the battle system, too, at the 16-minute mark. There’s also recent news about Dawn of War 4 too if you’re interesting in how that’s shaping up too.

2025-12-16T17:14:52,"This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker review: Mesmerizingly moreish","Finding the best clicker games can be tricky, but there have been some exceptional releases in recent years. One gambling clicker that stands out from the crowd is This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker – it’s a simple but stylish addition to the genre. Here’s The Escapist’s full review of This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker , looking at everything from its minimalistic yet engrossing style of play to the smart inclusion of the expeditions feature, along with a summary of whether it’s worth it as a non-idler fan. The Escapist recaps This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker is a gambling-themed incremental clicker game, developed by Mash and published by both Oro Interactive and Drillhounds. In This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker , you’re trapped in a carnival by a jester and tasked with earning a billion coins by flipping cards and creating poker hands. Every successful poker hand – like a straight or a flush – rewards coins over time. As you progress, you’ll be able to pick up further cards, upgrades, and buffs to help you earn even more coins, getting you closer to escaping the clutches of the strange jester that’s holding you captive. The gameplay is simple and pared-back, with the hands-off approach that you’d expect from an idler, but it’s stylish and engaging, too. There’s a decent upgrade tree, along with an expedition system that lets you collect obscenely powerful cards. Folks who aren’t keen on clickers won’t have much to get excited about here – it is a divisive genre, after all. Fans of the niche will love This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker , though, as it’s a best-in-class example of a gambling clicker. Simple but effective The art style here is vibrant and lively.

Interactive/Drillhounds In This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker , you’re trapped in a carnival by a strange jester – not a joker – who wants you to earn a billion coins in return for your freedom. You’ll need to do this by flipping cards to play poker hands, with each hand rewarding you with coins. Different poker hands are worth different amounts of money, so you’ll get more for a straight than for a high card or pair. As you progress and begin earning coins, you’ll be able to pick up handy upgrades from an upgrade tree, providing you with everything from extra decks to bonuses for specific hand-types. It’s a simple style of play, but it’ll be familiar to folks who enjoy clickers and idlers. For any other genre, saying it’s easy to put down would be insulting; for a clicker, saying that it’s easy to dip in and out of is nothing but a compliment. As you progress, you’ll be able to get more hands. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/Mash/Oro Interactive/Drillhounds If you played the This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker demo , there won’t be too many surprises waiting for you in terms of gameplay. Everything felt a little more polished than the demo, with the playing field looking smoother and the upgrade tree being easier to navigate; however, no major mechanical changes were implemented. The presence of the ledger scroll on the playing field was a small but impactful decision that helped with tracking progress nicely. For those who aren’t great with numbers – this reviewer included – having a tracker that updates constantly will be very helpful. Strengthened by expeditions Expeditions were the highlight of the game. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/Mash/Oro Interactive/Drillhounds Alongside the standard gameplay loop of clicking or automating card flips, the mechanic that stood out the most was the expedition system. After you progress with the game, you’ll unlock the ability to start an expedition with a particular hand. This expedition will take a set amount of time, then it’ll present you with a chest, allowing you to pick up new, wacky cards. These cards aren’t standard playing cards – they can include multiple numbers, suits, or other special abilities, greatly enhancing your chances of scoring highly. While This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker does have elements of luck to it, the expedition system and upgrades tree added a nice element of strategy to the game. A smaller detail worth mentioning is that the cards obtained from expeditions sometimes featured lively artwork, adding a nice visual variety to the game. Fans of clickers will find lots to love here. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/Mash/Oro Interactive/Drillhounds This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker didn’t throw up any major performance issues, quirks, or glitches during the review session. It ran well, and it looked lovely, too, with a pixel art style and jewel-toned color palette. Ultimately, this is a game that’ll go down a treat with fans of gambling clickers, rather than fans of traditional poker games . It’s a simple yet engrossing title that’s clearly been made with love, and while a hands-off style of play might not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s a stellar example of a high-quality incremental clicker game. If you’re not generally a fan of clickers and idlers, though, this might not be the game for you. Games like Balatro or even the demo for The Devil’s Due may be more your speed, with a hands-on style of play. Ask The Escapist When did This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker come out? This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker came out on December 11, 2025. What is the most-played clicker game? In terms of sheer popularity, Bongo Cat and Banana stand out as two of the most-played clicker games. What defines an “idle” game? Idle games take a hands-off approach to gameplay, typically running in the background and making progress while players are free to adjust stats or attend to other tasks. The gameplay style is fondly referred to as “number go up” gameplay by fans. What are the best gambling clicker games?

2025-12-16T16:28:10,Epic and Owlcat release some tasty ‘The Expanse: Osiris Reborn’ details,"Epic Games and Owlcat Games have released some long-awaited details about The Expanse: Osiris Reborn in a new dev-blog Epic’s press office states that the developers are “pushing fidelity and scale to the next level” in their attempt to tell a story within The Expanse’s intellectual property. The Expanse: Osiris Reborn graphics teased For those not familiar with the IP, The Expanse novels are the collective names for the stories penned by Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck. Both authors use the shared pen name James S. A. Corey. They cover a futuristic colonial human society across Earth, Mars, and the Moon (Luna). In this theatre, numerous intriguing, well-crafted plotlines led Amazon to acquire the IP and turn it into a hit show. The game teased by Epic and Owlcat, however, draws from a generic well within the established setting, putting players in the seat of a Pinkwater Security mercenary on shore leave in one of the many space colonies. Owlcat’s first foray into third-person cinematics In the latest update , both Game Design Director Leonid Rastorguev and CTO Alexey Drobyshevsky discuss the studio’s transition to Unreal Engine. This is a hefty leap for Owlcat, as their previous experience is rooted in narrative-heavy CRPGs like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader and the popular Pathfinder titles. Moving into the cinematic world, which already has high standards set by older titles like Mass Effect and Dead Space, is a long way from home for the company, and Owlcat acknowledges this in the developer interview by tipping its hat to both genre-defining games. “It’s about three or four times bigger than the teams behind previous games were,” said Rastorguev. “Bearing in mind this, it’s still about production quality. It’s still smaller than anything we made before because it’s more focused.” Expanding on previously set space-faring standards From the sounds of it, this could be a smaller narrative title set in a more spectacular setting in the Expanse universe . Both Rastorguev and Drobyshevsky discuss “fidelity” and the game’s visuals, rather than its hardcore gameplay or any playstyles beyond space combat. Rastorguev also flagged the issue of graphical representation and the challenges of the cinematics and the hardware required to render them fully. “Filling the locations with final graphics makes it very heavy in terms of computing speed, and so we had to adapt the workflows to keep developers able to iterate on the location within reasonable times because… if you just load the whole locations with final graphics, it takes loads of time,” he said. Zero G space fights One of the cool things from the dev diary is that Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut, was brought on board to help tether realism to the production of the game’s core elements. “It was really hard for the game designers,” Drobyshevsky says about the third-person development of Zero G environments. “And it was also really hard for the programmers.” “Unreal Engine, and every single engine, assumes that there’s a plane that you work on, and when you have the zero-gravity segments where everything then comes from any direction, where you can stand on different surfaces… It took a lot of work and rewriting major parts of the engine to make this work. It was a significant achievement for us,” he concluded. Cosmetics in space opera games are a part of the escapism, but the boundaries set for players can easily tip into a constrained nightmare or an overwhelming vastness. Getting the balance right within the exploratory boundaries is something The Expanse does well in both book and TV formats without skimping on the window dressing. Owlcat would do well to channel that theme and learn from past space-game mistakes, or risk having cosmetic gaming mechanics mixed with impressive visuals at the expense of escapism and depth. Rastorguev states that the “RPG system is built,” and Owlcat decided to “turn from the class system to a more open approach where you can shape your build freely on the go.” We’ll keep an eye on what appears to be an interesting take on a much-loved sci-fi IP, but hopefully the next development diary digs a little deeper into the gaming mechanics and playstyles.

2025-12-16T16:07:33,Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension review: Celestial dairy,"Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension is a post-game slice of donut-filled DLC that showcases a new layer of Lumiose City. Featuring otherworldly dimensions and a host of new Mega Pokémon, it’s a strange and charming journey that dedicated Pokémon fans will love. If you’ve been wondering whether the Pokémon Legends Z-A DLC is worth it, you’ll find The Escapist’s full, spoiler-free Mega Dimension DLC review below, looking at everything from the core gameplay to the story content. The Escapist recaps Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension initially came out on October 16, 2025, offering a few cosmetics alongside the main game, but its new story content was released on December 10, 2025. The Mega Dimension DLC revolves around Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, and a girl named Ansha. Hoopa can open up strange rifts around Lumiose City and give the player access to an alternate world called Hyperspace Lumiose. The DLC focuses on surveying Hyperspace Lumiose and uncovering the cause of the strange rifts, offering a blend of challenging battles, completionist content, and narrative sequences. The gameplay in Mega Dimension is somewhat grindy in places, which’ll make it divisive in the Pokémon community. Surveying Hyperspace Lumiose involves racking up points, and the number of points needed gets a lot sharper as you make progress. If you don’t mind a little grindiness in your Pokémon games, Mega Dimension is a delight to play through. The story is both sweet and otherworldly, offering a deeper look at fan-favorite characters. A tasty addition to the Z-A story You’ll meet Ansha early on. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/The Pokémon Company Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension is a post-game addition to the 2025 Legends title that provides a chunk of new missions, Megas, and most importantly, the ability to craft tasty donuts that allow you to travel through portals. The DLC kicks off with a side mission on the top of Hotel Z, with a mysterious kid named Ansha introducing herself to the player character – accompanied by the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa. She requests help creating a donut for Hoopa, which quickly results in her setting up shop as Hotel Z’s resident donut chef. Donuts provide a mystical burst of energy that allows Hoopa to open up strange rifts in space and create a gateway to an area referred to in-game as Hyperspace Lumiose. It’s a dreamy, alternate version of Lumiose City. These rifts have been popping up frequently throughout Lumiose City, and following in the footsteps of the main game’s story, the player character and Team MZ must get to the bottom of what’s causing them. Beloved characters like Corbeau make an appearance, alongside familiar faces like Korrina. Korrina is one of the more memorable characters. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/The Pokémon Company The core gameplay in Mega Dimension revolves around surveying Hyperspace Lumiose and completing tasks in the alternate version of Lumiose City, accessible via Hoopa’s portals. These tasks include collecting items, destroying targets, and catching critters. The Pokémon inside Hyperspace Lumiose are notably stronger than their regular Lumiose City counterparts – and this includes Pokémon suffering from Rogue Mega Evolution. There are some tricky battles in the Mega Dimension DLC, both against Rogue Mega ‘mons and key characters like Successor Korrina. Interestingly, there are Pokémon from different regions that pop up in Hyperspace Lumiose, adding some extra value for completionists and collectors who want to pad out their Pokédex. They’re harder to catch, thanks to the obscene level boost that Hyperspace Lumiose provides, but they’re worth it as a collector. Divisive gameplay, with some great battles Celestial butter would make a great band name. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/The Pokémon Company There’s a strong sense of progression with Mega Dimension , as you’ll gain access to new ingredients after crucial battles that allow Ansha to make even more powerful donuts, like Nice Butter. There isn’t an explanation for why space butter is a reward for defeating Mega Absol Z and who put it in a floating golden Poké Ball, but it helps to provide a sense of progression as you play through the DLC, regardless. It was admittedly quite funny to receive the first slab of butter after the initial Rogue Mega fight; it felt surreal, adding to the dreamy energy that Hyperspace Lumiose gives off. Mega Dimension ’s gameplay will likely be a hit for some and a miss for others. You’ll spend the bulk of your time in Hyperspace Lumiose, farming points, with the rest of your gameplay being devoted to trickier battles. Some of the Mega Dimension battles are significantly harder than the main game’s fights, particularly towards the end. Mega fans will get a kick out of the DLC. Image credit: Em Stonham for The Escapist/The Pokémon Company Diehard Pokémon fans – like this reviewer – will adore the extra challenges that Mega Dimension presents, both in its battles and its expanded Pokédex. Folks who dislike grindier gameplay or intense battles may not find as much to love, though. Performance-wise, the Mega Dimension DLC ran smoothly and didn’t throw up any glitches or quirks during the review sessions. The small alterations to the battle visuals were a welcome addition, too, making for a less visually chaotic experience. Pokémon Legends Z-A received some criticism for its visual style at launch, with some folks feeling it was visually underwhelming or flat. The Mega Dimension DLC felt a lot more lively with its visual style; Hyperspace Lumiose felt weirdly dreamy to explore, and the cutscenes felt a splash more vibrant as well. While the gameplay style in Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension won’t be a hit for everyone, due to the grindy Hyperspace Lumiose sequences and trickier battles, it is a fun addition to the main game experience. Completionist fans and seasoned battlers will find a lot to get excited about with the Mega Dimension DLC. Ask The Escapist When did Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension come out? Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension ’s story content came out on December 10, 2025. How do you start the Mega Dimension content? To start the Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension DLC content, you need to finish the main story campaign in Z-A , then head to the hotel roof and pick up the side mission you find there. Is the Mega Dimension DLC worth it? If you’re a collector or completionist-oriented player, the Mega Dimension DLC is worth it. It’s a little grindy in places, but for folks who like to collect critters while learning more about the world of Pokémon, it’s worth the extra cash. Who gave Az Lucario in Pokémon? Az was given Lucario by Korrina to help watch over him, acting as a protector of sorts. Are there new Megas in Pokémon Legends Z-A – Mega Dimension? Yes, Mega Dimension features new Mega Pokémon, including Mega Lucario Z and Mega Absol Z.

2025-12-16T00:21:20,"Tomb Raider has a unified timeline, new Lara Croft voice actor","It's all coming together. Tomb Raider has been going strong since 1996, with myriad games and voice actors behind it. Current steward Crystal Dynamics has recently spoken to how it will unify the franchise’s different iterations into a single timeline, and who will be voicing the current version of protagonist Lara Croft. A unified Tomb Raider timeline Speaking with GamesRadar , Crystal Dynamics’ Will Kerslake detailed where both new Tomb Raider games — Legacy of Atlantis and Catalyst — fit into the larger timeline. “From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider Underworld ,” Kerslake said. “With the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we’re seeing a more experienced Lara Croft.” So that means that Crystal Dynamics latest ‘survivor’ trilogy — Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider , and Shadow of the Raider — canonically come first in the overall timeline. The 1996 original Tomb Raider , Tomb Raider Anniversary , and the new Legacy of Atlantis come next — all roughly in the same position — followed by a host of sequels. Finally, Catalyst comes at the end of the timeline, behind Tomb Raider Underworld . “Same character; two different time periods in her life,” Kerslake summarised as part of a Q&A following last week’s Game Awards. Alix Wilton Regan takes over as Lara Croft The two new Tomb Raider games will feature a new voice actor as Lara Croft: Alix Wilton Regan. Regan, who replaces Camilla Luddington as Croft, is no stranger to video games. Previously, she’s voiced characters including Specialist Samantha Traynor in Mass Effect 3 , the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age Inquisition , Aya in Assassin’s Creed Origins , and more. “[Regan] was already a fan when we met her,” said Crystal Dynamics’ Scot Amos in The Game Awards Q&A. “And then being able to talk to her, and [gaining] a sense that she has that wit and that charm and charisma that is a natural essence and core for Lara, but she also has that confidence and that depth of emotionality that we need for telling these great stories.” Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis comes first in 2026; Tomb Raider Catalyst is expected in 2027.

2025-12-15T20:52:26,Dead by Daylight Halloween to be delisted in January 2026,"Want to play as Michael Myers? Better buy it soon... Dead by Daylight ‘s Halloween chapter will be removed for sale from 19 January 2026, Behaviour Interactive has recently confirmed. Players will have the chance to pay and unlock Laurie Strode and The Shape (Michael Myers) up until 11.00 am ET on 19 January 2026. Any combination of Halloween content — the full pack or individual characters — will be playable beyond that purchase deadline, provided you pulled the trigger. Halloween ‘s Haddonfield map will be pulled from rotation as of 19 January, so those of you who haven’t picked up the House of Pain Achievement or Trophy — unlocked by repairing the generators in the Myers home — should make that priority in the next few weeks. Character Perks will remain available for the characters, provided players have unlocked the characters ahead of Behaviour’s deadline.

A new trailer for Housemarque’s upcoming Saros has shown off the conflict that players will face — both with teammates and things quite extra-terrestrial. “The events of Saros take place on Carcosa, a shape-shifting, hostile alien planet; one that changes on every death, and offers a wide variety of environments and enemies for you to encounter,” Housemarque said back at the game’s reveal . “Beneath a haunting eclipse, survive Carcosa’s shifting dangers, master bullet ballet combat, and come back stronger after every death in Housemarque’s next evolution of third-person action,” Sony today said alongside the game’s new pre-0rder trailer. Given that the trailer above is titled “Pre-Order Trailer”, it goes without saying that pre-orders for the title are now available. Fancy that!

2025-12-12T02:30:28,Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original Tomb Raider,"(If it's real at all, that is...) Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis is a reimaging of the original, 1996 Tomb Raider adventure, and is planned for a 2026 release. The game’s announcement trailer is below. “ Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a stunning reimagining of the 1996 genre-defining game,” reads a description on the trailer. “As Lara Croft, harness your wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time—from the jungles of Peru to the ancient ruins of Greece, the deserts of Egypt, and a mysterious Mediterranean island shrouded in myth. Traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators as you hunt for the scattered pieces of the Scion, an artifact of immeasurable power. “Whether you’re a veteran raider or new to Lara’s world, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis delivers jaw-dropping visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises, while honoring the spirit and atmosphere of Lara Croft’s debut adventure.” Original story: ResetEra user NeoRaider took to the forum overnight with an image suggested to be box art of the upcoming title, as clipped and shown above. NeoRaider claims the image — and screengrabs from a trailer or video — all come from the Tomb Raider Forums (TRF) — so, as always, take the accuracy of this leak, and the images, with a grain of salt. “It was shared on a TRF in members only part of the forum, but not by direct source,” NeoRaider wrote. “So the source is TRF, as someone else said here already, not sure what other source and what else are you asking for.” “It was shared by a user on Tomb Raider forums who has a ‘trusted source’,” added ResetEra user zaxil456. “No idea if it’s real but they’ve shared more screenshots since.” Adding fuel to the fire, ResetEra user shinobi seemed to corroborate news of the remake, adding The Game Awards announcements will involve, “more than one thing.” “You won’t be upset,” the tipster added . We’ll likely find out if Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis is real or not within about 12 hours or so — The Game Awards’ pre-show kicks off in about seven hours from now.

2025-12-12T02:04:38,Control Resonant has “a new threat” beyond the Hiss,"""There is a new antagonist here."" Control Resonant was today detailed by Remedy, a sequel to Control and the latest in the Remedy Connected Universe . And, while the Hiss — the antagonist of both Control and FBC Firebreak — appear in Resonant ‘s reveal trailer, Remedy is being ultra careful to point out they’re not the big bad of the sequel. Mikael Kasurinen, the creative director of Control Resonant and the co-creative director of Remedy, was incredibly careful to detail the main antagonist of Resonant as “a new threat” in a hands-off preview of the sequel ahead of today’s reveal at The Game Awards. I pressed both him and Thomas Puha, Remedy’s director of communications, on that point. “It is a new threat,” Kasurinen reiterated with Stevivor. “I want to be clear on that. There is a new antagonist here.” “Yeah, I think [in] the original game — I’m not saying we failed, but establishing the threat, properly, was definitely the thing we wanted to tackle here,” added Puha. Whelp… “The Hiss ended up — maybe felt almost — like you were fighting a disease,” Kasurinen concluded. “So, we want to add more elements of personality this time around. “More will be revealed,” said Kasurinen. Rest assured, we’re as invested in Remedy’s universe as you all, so we’ll keep pressing them and will have more information as it becomes available. Until then, what do you make of Resonant’ s reveal announcement? Control Resonant is planned for a 2026 release on Windows PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Mac via Steam and the Apple App Store, and consoles including Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5.

2025-12-12T02:02:45,Control Resonant Preview: Dylan takes Manhattan,"""The sibling has gone rogue/fishing."" Control 2 is actually Control Resonant , a sequel to Remedy’s incredibly popular shooter (and our very own GOTY 2019 ) set outside the Oldest House seven years after the events of the original. Ahead of today’s reveal at The Game Awards, Stevivor was able to sit down with Remedy and attend a remote, hands-off showing that detailed Dylan Faden’s new adventure. “ Control Resonant takes place seven years after the first Control game,” Mikael Kasurinen, the creative director of Control Resonant and the co-creative director of Remedy, told us. “Jesse mysteriously disappears, and the lockdown [of the Oldest House] falls apart. All the paranatural forces fill onto the streets of Manhattan. On top of that, a new threat is reshaping our reality and creating new, devastating monsters. “Dylan wakes up, and this is where the second game starts,” Kasurinen continued. “He’s the only one who can fight back and help contain the disaster.” Dylan and his Aberrant. Dylan, of course, was a main focal point of the original Control — Prime Candidate 6, or P6, to the P7 of his sister and protagonist Jesse Faden. Following an Altered World Event in the town of Ordinary, Maine, Dylan was apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Control, where he remained until Jesse entered the Oldest House and discovered him seventeen years later. A further seven years later, in 2026, Dylan is finally free. “He has lived his whole life inside the Oldest House,” Kasurinen said. “To Dylan, the door leading to the streets of Manhattan might as well be a portal into an alien dimension. This is a discovery of a new reality just like what the Oldest House was to Jesse.” As such, Control and Control Resonant are remarkably different from each other, with each title representing, “one of the siblings and their respective journeys through this world,” according to Kasurinen. I don’t remember this in Manhattan… “You can play both of these games in any order,” Kasurinen asserted. “They stand on their own feet, like two independent siblings. This was always the story of two siblings who [try] to reconnect.” While Jesse fought back against The Hiss using her own parautilitarian abilities coupled with a ranged pistol in her Service Weapon, Dylan will use his natural abilities alongside a melee-focused sledgehammer called the Aberrant. “The Aberrant [is a] shapeshifting weapon that changes on the fly in the different forms,” Kasurinen said of Dylan’s companion. “There are several forms for the players to discover. “Aesthetically, the weapon is raw, crude, and to the point. Function over form; only results matter. It allows you on to pull off superhuman feats, especially when combined with [Dylan’s] powerful abilities.” Dylan’s great and all… but where’s Jesse? Just as Dylan’s sledgehammer is anything but a normal one, so too is Resonant’ s setting of Manhattan. The mega-city is closed off by an “otherworldly barrier,” according to Kasurinen, and will function as a, “larger, more open-ended world,” as compared to a straight up open world. It’ll also look and function like the ever-changing Oldest House rather than a regular ol’ city, Kasurinen assured us. Kasurinen continued to say that Resonant’s Manhattan is, “a world filled with secrets, activities, and stories — none of them filler, but carefully designed and integrated into the larger open-ended world. “A big goal was transitioning the game from action-adventure to action-RPG,” he continued. “We define this as having player-driven, open-ended exploration, more meaningful progression, and real choices. Players can create distinctive builds, complementing their gameplay style. We want to encourage boldness, exploration, and experimentation.” It’s not just in regard to the setting — opened-ended world rather than open world — in which Remedy is very careful with its words. Though Resonant’ s trailer shows Dylan fighting the Hiss, Kasurinen was careful to repeatedly call what Dylan will face in Manhattan “a new threat”. Picking up on that, I asked him to elaborate. “More will be revealed, but it is a new threat,” Kasurinen told Stevivor. “I want to be clear on that. There is a new antagonist here. “The Hiss ended up — maybe felt almost — like you were fighting a disease. So, we want to add more elements of personality this time around.” Control Resonant is planned for a 2026 release on Windows PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Mac via Steam and the Apple App Store, and consoles including Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5.

2025-12-12T02:01:15,Control Resonant is a game sequel and not a TV show (though is partially funded by Annapurna),"Control Resonant was today announced by Remedy at The Game Awards, and has been confirmed by the studio as a sequel to 2019’s Control rather than a television or film endeavour. “Players will explore a warped Manhattan on the brink of paranatural annihilation in this thrilling action-adventure RPG,” Remedy said of the newly announced title. “Unleash the extraordinary powers of Dylan Faden as he fights for his humanity and survival against a reality-bending cosmic threat.” Those with keen eyes will note an Annapurna logo on the game’s reveal trailer, below, though Remedy was quick to point out that Resonant, “will be published by Remedy Entertainment,” and that, “Annapurna Pictures are co-financing and co-producing the game as part of a strategic partnership with Remedy Entertainment.” “After years in confinement at the hands of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), Dylan Faden’s former captors are deploying him at the peak of a supernatural crisis. Charged with combating a mysterious cosmic entity as it alters fundamental aspects of our reality, Dylan must harness his new found powers to take the fight to the myriad threats overwhelming Manhattan.,” Remedy continued. “On the path to unlocking the full potential of his supernatural abilities Dylan will also seek out his sister, FBC Director Jesse Faden, as he struggles to comprehend and contain the dangers that have spilled beyond the confines of the Oldest House to tear the world apart,” said Remedy. “ Control Resonant pushes our paranatural action RPG series into an expansive, reality-warping playground of choice, power, and consequence,” said Mikael Kasurinen, the game’s creative director. “You don’t have to know the first game to jump into the sequel, we’ve made this one easy to pick up and hard to put down. “We’re pushing the scale beyond anything we’ve done before, elevating combat, exploration, and storytelling into a bigger, more memorable experience,” Kasurinen continued. “It’s ambitious, a little wild, and we can’t wait for players to get lost in it.” Control Resonant is planned for a 2026 release on Windows PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Mac via Steam and the Apple App Store, and consoles including Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5.

Update: Surprising absolutely no one, Leon has today been confirmed in Resident Evil Requiem . You can check him out in action via the new Game Awards 2025 trailer, below. “Resident Evil Requiem is now available for pre-order,” Capcom said alongside the new trailer. “Experience terrifying survival horror with FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, and dive into pulse-pounding action with legendary agent Leon S. Kennedy. Both of their journeys and unique gameplay styles intertwine into a heart-stopping, emotional experience that will chill you to your core.” Original story: Resident Evil Requiem will feature RE2, RE4, and RE6 protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, its PS5 cover art has today confirmed. Twitter user SpookyHoo first noticed the game’s updated cover art , taking to Twitter and showing off Leon’s pretty face via his pre-downloads screen. Since then, others — including this outlet, have confirmed the image is real. In it, you can see Leon’s large looming face positioned behind the back of fellow protagonist Grace Ashcroft. You can see a portion of that cover art above. Earlier this week, a GameStop listing stated that Resident Evil Village ‘s Rose Winters would appear in-game ; previously, Leon’s name appeared alongside a listing of in-game bonus items. Could Rose be a placeholder for Leon in this new instance, or will we have three protagonists inside Requiem ? Time will tell… and we’ll most likely find out during this week’s Game Awards on Thursday night, Los Angeles-time. Last month, Capcom’s Masato Kumazawa called one very specific “leak” of Leon appearing in Requiem as “fake news”. “Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong,” Kumazawa told us . “It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation. “There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eye patch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news,” Kumazawa told us.

Booth also serves as the chief creative officer of the studio. “We’re greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game,” said Sony vice president Christian Svensson . “Their unique creative voice and passion for innovating across all forms of interactive entertainment perfectly aligns with SIE’s mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players,” Svensson continued. “We can’t wait for gamers to step into the world they’ve been building.” Bad Robot Games is a division of TV and film’s Bad Robot, which is responsible for productions including Lost, Cloverfield, Mission: Impossible, and, of course, 2010’s Star Trek Kelvin timeline films. The studio also had a hand in the mobile Silent Hill Ascension . “Formed by JJ Abrams and a team passionate about innovation in gaming, Bad Robot Games is a dedicated game studio working on new and existing transmedia franchises,” the studio said of itself. “The company is fully remote, and made up of a diverse community of creatives focused on creating worlds you can experience across all screens.” Bad Robot Games was formed in 2018 as part of a partnership with Tencent and WB Games.

This is the Divinity we’ve always wanted to make and you’re going to have loads of fun with it.” Original story: Geoff Keighley has taken to social media to tease a real-life monolith in the Mojave Desert, and some believe it’s to tease a new Diablo 4 expansion that will be announced during The Game Awards 2025. Keighley took to Twitter with an image of a monolith covered in a host of skeletons, alongside the caption “regal.inspiring.thickness”. That corresponds to a specific point on the earth, using the what3words geocode service . Those close to the Mojave Desert location have provided photos of the real-life monolith, both in the daytime and at night. Needless to say, the monolith is far more impressive in the dark . Windows Central’s Jez Corden has also taken to social media , reporting that the tease is connected to a 2026 Diablo 4 expansion that will also bring a new ranking system and leaderboards. Whether Corden is right or wrong will be revealed at The Game Awards, we’ll find out soon enough. The Game Awards 2025 livestreams from 12.00 pm AEDT on 12 December here in Australia. Update: Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has taken to ResetEra to state that the tease isn’t related to Diablo 4 after all. “No idea where Jez is getting that, but this statue is not teasing the Diablo 4 expansion,” Schreier wrote, adding, “I don’t currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it’s a good one.” Once again, we’ll find out at The Game Awards next week.

2025-12-11T21:05:51,You’ve got ’til the end of 2025 to transition your Stadia controller,"Users get a one-year extension regarding a planned cutover. Just a friendly reminder: Google Stadia users have until 31 December of this year to transition their Stadia controller to then be used on a different platform. As we reported back in January 2023 , Stadia users have access to a self-service tool that will transition their Stadia controller to a regular ol’ Bluetooth one. Once transitioned, the Stadia controller will use Bluetooth to pair with other platforms and systems. The self-service tool is a one-way affair, but that’s fine; Stadia was closed down almost two years ago . The self-service tool was first offered during 2023, then extended to the end of 2024, and then extended to the end of this year. Will it be extended again? Maybe, but I’d ask why you’d risk it. You can head here and use a Google Chrome browser to start the swap . Google Stadia was never officially available within Australia. This article was first published on 18 December 2023.

2025-12-10T18:57:29,Dogpile Review: Fun for the whole (furry) family,"Literally! Surprise! Dogpile is out now , and holy hell is it fun. I’ve had access to the roguelike dog deckbuilder for a week now, and my ROG Xbox Ally X has been in high demand the entire time, passed around from parents to nieces and nephews, all because of it. Dogpile has a simple premise: merge two of the same dog to create an even bigger dog. Then, merge that with another; rinse, repeat. This can literally be all that Dogpile is, using its yellow deck — merge dogs and chill. That core is incredibly relaxing — dare I say, cozy — if that’s all you’re looking for. Look at all those doggos. Of course, there can be more — using any other colour deck will add newfound challenges, or helpers, as you merge. Helpful traits like Friendly will make it easier to merge two dogs of the same type in Dogpile ‘s Tetris -like well-shaped play area, while negative traits like Crated will make it impossible for specific dogs to be merged for a certain number of goes. In between rounds, a pet shop will allow you to buy more dogs, more traits, or dog tags that’ll add multiple traits or gameplay-changing mechanics to the mix. One memorable one will make the playfield a zero-gravity area (have fun trying to predict that one!), while another upends the playfield after each turn. That matter mechanic proved quite useful trying to work with Dogpile ‘s pentultimate canine, a large, U-shaped good boy that can act as a bridge or a cup, depending on how it is positioned. While you quickly understand how this all comes together after a couple rounds, Dogpile could certainly do a better job of explaining things like traits to new players. My fourteen-year-old niece, who definitely one was the one who played the most, was quite frustrated by traits and needed me to sit down and walk her through things over multiple playthroughs. Zero-gravity makes things interesting… While Dogpile ran most excellently on my handheld ROG Xbox Ally X, I had a far different experience attempting to play on my 2020 Surface Book. There, the game — admittedly, a beta, development build provided ahead of Dogpile ‘s actual release — locked up every eight minutes, almost like clockwork. I’ve not had that same issue on the far more modern handheld PC, thankfully. Finally, the only other issue I’ve experienced is that quitting out of a round only to continue it again later doesn’t appear to work. Upon hitting “Continue” in the main menu, I’m presented with a new playing field, devoid of dogs, and sometimes with the traits I’d acquired from the match I wanted to pick back up. It’s not a huge deal, to be honest, as the joy in Dogpile comes from simply picking it up and playing it. Even my mom and dad’s cat sat with wonder and watched as we connected the ROG Xbox Ally X to a TV and played in the living room for a while. Simply put, this is $10 USD well spent. Melbourne-made, Dogpile is out now on Windows PC via Steam.

As part of Day of the Devs’ Game Awards Edition, the Melbourne-made Dogpile has shadow dropped today on Windows PC via Steam. Created through combination of two studios, Toot Games (My Arms are Longer Now) and Studio Folly ( Real Bird Fake Bird) , Dogpile is described as a “doglike deckbuilder” in which players attempt to merge the same types of dogs. Merged dogs grow into even larger ones, with the end goal to make as many mergers as possible. “Like in real life, dogs come with quirks and untapped potential! You’ll discover any variety of weird traits such as Barky, Sleepy, Timid, Cool and more,” reads a press release.  “Take your dogs to the Dog Wash to add even more traits, and find Dog Tags that bolster and benefit from Trait synergy!” If you like what you see from the feature above, you can go and grab Dogpile on Steam right this very second .

2025-12-10T17:38:18,Call of Duty won’t have back-to-back releases of Black Ops or Modern Warfare,"Activision acknowledges ""the franchise has not met your expectations fully."" Activision Blizzard has acknowledged that Call of Duty Black Ops 7 “has not met [players’] expectations fully,” and has promised it will no longer ship back-to-back releases of Black Ops and Modern Warfare iterations year-on-year. “Thank you for all for the feedback we have received over the last few months,” the publisher said in a statement . “ Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. “To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.” Detailing a larger strategy, Activision Blizzard confirmed that, “we will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. “We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.” In our review of Black Ops 7 , Ben said that, “the Black Ops 7 campaign completely loses its way and is the series’ worst since Treyarch didn’t bother to include one at all with Black Ops 4 . It tries to borrow from elsewhere to do things differently, but doesn’t do a good job and loses what makes Call of Duty campaigns great in the process.” Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is currently available on Windows PC via Steam and Battle.net, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, PS4, and PS5.

2025-12-10T16:59:27,Netflix says games “relatively minor” in acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery,"Ruh roh. Netflix has said that Warner Bros. Discovery’s video game assets were “relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things” in its $82.7 billion USD acquisition deal . Speaking in a conference presentation (as reported by Pocket Gamer), Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the likes of Rocksteady, Avalanche, and NetherRealm were a low priority in the midst of the larger acquisition. Stating that Warner Bros. had done “great work in the game space,” he continued to state that Netflix, ‘actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things. “Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering,” Peters continued. “They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.” Overly interested in the properties or not, Netflix will gain control of Mortal Kombat ‘s NetherRealm, Batman Arkham ‘s Rocksteady, LEGO games’ TT Games, Hogwarts Legacy ‘s Avalanche Software, and several WB Games studios ( Batman Arkham Origins, Gotham Knights) if the acquisition goes through. That won’t happen, mind you, until late 2026 or into 2027. The post Netflix says games “relatively minor” in acquisition of Warner Bros.

2025-12-09T15:18:33,Something Tomb Raider will be announced at The Game Awards 2025,"New game? Announced TV show? Both? Who knows! Something Tomb Raider- related will be featured at The Game Awards 2025 later this week, event host Geoff Keighley has teased. Or rather, technically, Fortnite teased it. “As just revealed in our The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in Thursday night for a look at the future of one of gaming’s most iconic franchises [ Tomb Raider ],” Keighley wrote on Twitter. As for what that actually means is anyone’s guess, as there are so many Tomb Raider- related things in the works — and even more rumoured. In terms of video games, Tomb Raider currently sits with Crystal Dynamics and Amazon Games, following the IPs sale from Embracer two years ago. Crystal Dynamics has been working on a new game since 2022, but we don’t know what it is exactly. We could be seeing a new game (and start of a trilogy?), or perhaps a rumoured remake of the original 1996 Tomb Raider . On the TV front, a live-action series headed up by Fleabag ‘s Phoebe Waller-Bridge is in the works , while Netflix has an animated series that you can watch right this second. Are we learning more about either, or both? Time will tell. The Game Awards 2025 livestreams from 12.00 pm AEDT on 12 December here in Australia.

2025-12-16T13:17:46,Santa Confirms He Will No Longer Be Gifting Xbox Consoles,"NORTH POLE — Immortal elf Santa Claus confirmed that Xbox consoles will no longer be included in his yearly gift distribution event after they disappeared from his website earlier this fall. “I will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles in my magical, bottomless sack,” said Claus. “It’s purely a business decision. I’m just not seeing the demand this year. When only two, three thousand kids put something on their list? It’s not worth my time to train the elves to make it. You’ve got to remember, we handle everything in-house. Production, marketing, distribution—the name of the game up here is efficiency. We can’t carry a weak product.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that he was not concerned by the development. “We still consider the North Pole workshop an important business partner,” said Nadella. “They’ve invested heavily in our AI ventures, and we’re thrilled to provide them with support from Microsoft Copilot. Think about it: Santa has to read billions of lists every year. Imagine the time he could save if he only had to read a short, fairly accurate summary of all of those lists. In fact, according to Copilot, shares in Nvidia are one of the most-requested gifts this year. Don’t miss out! For the love of God, please keep feeding money to the machine!” Market analysts believe this signals a larger shift in how mythical beings will distribute gaming and tech gifts going forward. “For years, we’ve heard rumblings that the traditional console model was unsustainable for these timeless creatures,” said Tim Lithgowe, an independent economics journalist. “As content becomes more widely available across multiple platforms, it makes less and less sense for these demigods to waste warehouse space on stock for a variety of consoles. They’re trying to get lean. Santa’s just-in-time-for-Christmas model in particular can’t accommodate any inventory that isn’t going to move. If a kid wants to play Fortnite, he’ll be just as happy playing it on Switch 2 or PS5.” At press time, a North Pole spokes-elf announced that all remaining Xbox consoles in their inventory will be given to naughty children in place of coal.

2025-12-15T12:59:17,Disney Adult Overjoyed by Hidden Mickey Found During Colonoscopy,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Diehard Disney fan Adam Finemann was ecstatic to notice in his colonoscopy results that his bowels contained a hidden Mickey, sources confirmed. “I was looking at the camera stills with my doctor, who was talking about something boring called diverticulitis or whatever, and then boom, I saw it clear as day!” said Finemann, 43, grinning ear to ear. “A near perfect hidden Mickey, right there in my own colon! I could hardly believe my eyes. It was like I was transported right back to Epcot. I could practically taste the turkey legs.” Finemann’s gastroenterologist, Dr. Paula Kochek, admits she wasn’t aware of the symbol’s significance. “Adam scared me half to death when he screamed and started pointing at the computer screen,” said Kocheck. “I thought he saw something clinically significant I was somehow missing. Turns out, he was just very amused by a hyperplastic polyp that looked vaguely like Mickey Mouse ears. I offered to schedule a follow up to remove it, but he insisted he’d rather it ‘stay inside him forever.’ It’s benign of course, so that’s fine, but as his physician now I feel weird.” Adam’s wife Chloe, also a self-proclaimed Disney adult, could hardly contain her spousal pride. “I always knew Adam had real Disney magic in him. I assumed it was figurative and not literal, of course, but clearly he’s even more special than I thought!” she said while picking her husband up from the appointment in their 2017 Toyota Camry with a vanity DSNYCPL license plate. “We’ll celebrate this weekend in Hollywood Studios—I booked us a little getaway, Lightning Lane Passes and all!” The couple later added they intend to have a photo of the “miraculous” hidden Mickey in Adam’s colon turned into a magnet that they can put on their fridge.

2025-12-09T12:39:39,Ganondorf’s Minions Suffer Existential Crisis Following Seventh Blood Moon Resurrection,"HYRULE KINGDOM — Legions of Ganondorf’s horrible henchmen have reported suffering an existential crisis of sorts following their seventh resurrection back to this mortal plane via the Blood Moon, confirmed sources. “Me used to think job easy,” stated a recently-revived Bokoblin to the press. “Spot hero, swing club, die fighting. Had purpose. This now seventh life…did me not do good job first six times? What do differently this time? Things not make as much sense now. Starting to re-think life choices. Maybe I not attack hero this time. Maybe I start woodworking business like I planned out of college. Ganon have many other monsters. It time I ask self what true purpose is.” Ganondorf, wielder of the Triforce of Power and the legendary King of Evil, spoke about the frequency with which he brings his slain foot soldiers back from the grave. “I do feel a little bad about bringing them back so often—occasionally,” said the Demon King. “But on the other hand, evil armies run up quite the tab, you know? Who do you think supplies them with all of their clubs, bows and other crude weaponry? If I have the ability to do it, which I do, by the way, then why spend more rupees than I need to? Plus, you have to think…it’s better than being dead. Is that insensitive to say? I don’t know. It’s true, in my opinion.” The Hero of Hyrule and wielder of the Blade of Evil’s Bane, Link, offered his thoughts on the matter as the primary person who sends Ganondorf’s minions to their mortal ends. “[Yeah, it’s never fun. It might look easy, building various horrifying contraptions to kill these guys, but it does take a toll on the brain. When I feel the worst is when I actually recognize the poor fellas after I’ve already slain them a couple of times.]” said the Hero, whose grunts and guttural screams were interpreted by a translator. “[It’s like, ‘Ah man, I know I blew up this Lizalfos with a bomb arrow last time. Sorry about that, dude. Unfortunately I do also have to burn you to a crisp with this flamethrower I put together.’ That’s just how it goes when you’re saving the kingdom. It’s nothing personal.]” At press time, the Blood Moon was seen rising once again, the aimless spirits of slain monsters returning to flesh, just as they did in a war long past.

2025-12-08T13:02:56,“Death by Lightning” Reveals President James Garfield Hated Mondays,"LOS ANGELES — Netflix’s new historical miniseries “Death by Lightning”, which focuses on the career and ultimate assassination of the 20th U.S. President James Garfield, has shed light on the much-overlooked politician’s time in office—including the fact that he had a particular distaste for Mondays, per reports. “There are so many little tidbits and interesting details from this time period that I find fascinating,” historian and TV critic Anthony Andrews told the press. “Reconstruction as a period of American history has long been underexplored in popular media. Furthermore, I’m learning more about James Garfield himself as a historical figure. I had no idea that he hated Mondays so much; there are multiple scenes where the word ‘MONDAY’ appears across the bottom of the screen and Garfield is depicted as visibly grumpy that day…I guess the Sunday Scaries even existed in 1880!” Actor Michael Shannon expounded upon his interest in the role and the series in a recent interview. “Any time I get the opportunity to play a weird little freak, I’ll take it,” said Shannon. “I’m joking, of course. But I was absolutely fascinated by this script and the surprises just kept coming as I continued reading. For example, did you know that this era was the time where the most lasagna was consumed in the Oval Office? I had no idea. I’m assuming that was due to the first large-scale wave of Italian immigrants coming to America around that time, but I severely underestimated just how pervasive Italian-American cuisine would become to the fabric of our country in a very short amount of time. President Garfield apparently loved it so much that he would request it for dinner multiple times a week. What a life!” Some viewers have noted that while the writing, costumes, and overall production quality of “Death by Lightning” are strong, they were a bit put off by some of the B-plot storylines. “I think the only things that kind of threw me off a little were the hijinks that Garfield and Chester A. Arthur would get into when they weren’t being presidential,” noted historical drama aficionado Ashley Mumma. “Like that one episode when the White House got a comfy new sitting chair and the two of them stood on each arm fighting over whose it was. Finally an aide yelled at them to share and Garfield stuffed Arthur underneath the chair cushion, saying ‘I’ll take the top half.’ Or when he tried to ship Arthur to Abu Dhabi in a box, only for him to be returned to the White House doorstep. It just seemed a little tonally inconsistent in comparison to the rest of the show.” At press time, co-star Matthew Macfadyen told journalists that one of Charles Guiteau’s lesser-known nicknames was “Odie.” The post “Death by Lightning” Reveals President James Garfield Hated Mondays appeared first on Hard Drive .",2025-12-17T11:45:55.639317,Peter Ferrarese,Hard Drive,https://hard-drive.net/death-by-lightning-reveals-president-james-garfield-hated-mondays/,38dd600eeaaa9d830acce7f5d8a5d54909524955,1883,en,0.1,"LOS ANGELES — Netflix’s new historical miniseries “Death by Lightning”, which focuses on the career and ultimate assassination of the 20th U.S. President James Garfield, has shed l",other,0.25

2025-12-05T16:00:00,Guest Removed From Dionysus’ Party for Decent Exposure,"MT OLYMPUS — A mild kerfuffle erupted at a party hosted by Dionysus when a guest was asked to leave. Alexios Nicolatis of Athens was escorted out after failing to adhere to the dress code of the event. “This is a brand new toga,” Nicolatis said in an interview outside of the venue, “they’ve got satyrs in there bearing it all. I don’t see what the problem is.” Nicolatis was told he could rejoin the party if he changed into something more appropriate. When asked about the incident, the God of Revelry clarified that Nicolatis wasn’t removed for indecent exposure.. “No ‘in’, just decent,” Dionysus explained, “that toga was covering everything. I enjoy unwrapping a gift as much as the next deity, but I’m holding parties every day, every hour on the hour, at six and ten, for two hours at a time, and every fifteen minutes. That’s a lot of laundry to do. Where’s your sense of indecency?” Nicolatis seemed to understand after having the dress code explained to him by nymphs waiting in line outside the venue. “I guess I should have realized when I saw the host of the party was dressed in a leopard print banana hammock that looked like it was holding the whole bunch.” At press time, the Mount Olympus party venue now has a sign on the door reading ‘No Shirt, No Sandals, No Sobriety’.

2025-12-04T14:37:52,Townspeople Furious After Samus Aran Repeatedly Drives Motorcycle 120 MPH Through School Zone,"GALACTIC OUTPOST 673 — Residents of the Galactic Federation outpost held an emergency town meeting last night to determine how to tackle the issue of bounty hunger Samas Aran repeatedly blowing through school zones at 120 mph. “We didn’t have any problems until Samus returned from her ‘business trip’ with that frightening motorcycle, which she insists on doing a buck twenty past the local middle school during pickup time. We know she’s done so much to protect the galaxy, which is why we’ve overlooked the unsightly space pirate viscera covering her ship or her space jumping across rooftops, but this is a serious problem,” said concerned parent Ryan Xylox. “The neighborhood watch has tried talking to her like a rational person, but all she does is flip us off while doing wheelies. If she doesn’t slow down, I’m getting the Superintendent involved, darn it!” Samus dismissed the townspeople’s complaints outright. “Boo fucking hoo. I didn’t go to school because I was too busy growing up in mountains and caves with bird people, so excuse me if Vi-0-La and I want to tear up some asphalt. If you want to blame anyone, it’s the city planner’s fault for putting a school on a 20 kilometer stretch of road. Where else am I supposed to open this baby up?” said Aran while doing donuts outside of the outpost’s 7-11. “These people are always looking for something to complain about. It’s all ‘no morph ball boosting’ or ‘no shinesparking’. Well next time Ridley shows up, they can call a different bounty hunter. Mama’s gonna ride her hog.” Outpost police were well aware of the numerous complaints against Samus. “We respond to multiple Samus related complaints every week but most of them end up being nothing, like walking her Metroid without a leash. This one though is a bit more serious, I mean she’s been riding that bike hard and someone’s kid is going to get hurt,” said officer Grant Henderson. “The only problem is that Samus literally does not give a shit about fines or jail time, plus she has some insane contract with the Federation so our hands are tied. If parents are concerned, I’d recommend home schooling before I get on Samus’ bad side.” At press time, neighbors looked on helplessly after Samus began ramping Vi-0-La off of the school’s newly installed speed bumps for massive air.
